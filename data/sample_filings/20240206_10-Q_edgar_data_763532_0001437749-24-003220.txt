Disaggregation of Revenue 

The Company disaggregates the revenue from contracts with customers by the timing of revenue recognition because the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, and timing of its revenue and cash flows. The table below presents a reconciliation of the disaggregation by reportable segments: 

Products and services transferred over time 

Products and services transferred over time 

Poles, other display solution elements 

Project management, installation services, shipping and handling 

Poles, other display solution elements 

Project management, installation services, shipping and handling 

Practical Expedients and Exemptions 

The Company s contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less, as such, the Company applies the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred and has omitted disclosures on the amount of remaining performance obligations. 

Shipping costs that are not material in context of the delivery of products are expensed as incurred. 

The Company s accounts receivable balance represents the Company s unconditional right to receive payment from its customers with contracts. Payments are generally due within 30 to 90 days of completion of the performance obligation and invoicing; therefore, payments do not contain significant financing components. 

The Company collects sales tax and other taxes concurrent with revenue-producing activities which are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment activities and included in cost of products and services sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

New Accounting Pronouncements: 

In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, creating an exception to the recognition and measurement principles in ASC 805. The amendment requires that entities apply ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than using fair value, to recognize and measure contracts assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, regardless of whether a business combination occurs in that period. The guidance should be applied prospectively; however, an entity that elects to early adopt in an interim period should apply the amendments to all business combinations that occurred during the fiscal year that includes that interim period. There has not been a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as a result of its adoption of the guidance on July 1, 2023. 

There were no customers or customer programs representing a concentration of 10 or more of the Company s consolidated net sales in the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, or 2022. There was no concentration of accounts receivable at December 31, 2023, or 2022. 

Summarized financial information for the Company s operating segments is provided for the indicated periods and as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022:

The segment net sales reported above represent sales to external customers. Segment operating income, which is used in management s evaluation of segment performance, represents net sales less all operating expenses. Identifiable assets are those assets used by each segment in its operations. 

The Company records a mark-up on inter-segment revenues. Any inter-segment profit in inventory is eliminated in consolidation. Inter-segment revenues were eliminated in consolidation as follows: 

Display Solutions Segment inter-segment net sales 

Weighted average shares outstanding during the period, net of treasury shares 

Weighted average vested restricted stock units outstanding 

Weighted average shares outstanding in the Deferred Compensation Plan during the period

Anti-dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, because the exercise price was greater than the average fair market price of the common shares or because the assumed proceeds from the award s exercise or vesting was greater than the average fair market price of the common shares.

In September 2021, the Company amended its existing million secured line of credit, to a million term loan and million remaining as a secured revolving line of credit. Both facilities expire in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. The principal of the term loan is repaid annually in the amount of million over a five -year period with a balloon payment of the remaining balance due on the last month. Interest on both the revolving line of credit and the term loan is charged based upon an increment over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or a base rate, at the Company s option. The base rate is calculated as the highest of (a) the Prime rate, (b) the sum of the Overnight Funding Rate plus basis points and (c) the sum of the Daily SOFR Rate plus basis points. The increment over the SOFR borrowing rate fluctuates between and basis points, and the increment over the Base Rate fluctuates between and basis points, both of which depend upon the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA ), as defined in the line of credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023, the Company s borrowing rate against its revolving line of credit was . The increment over the SOFR borrowing rate will be basis points for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The fee on the unused balance of the million committed line of credit fluctuates between and basis points. Under the terms of this line of credit, the Company is required to comply with financial covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and require a minimum fixed charge ratio. As of December 31, 2023, there was million available for borrowing under the million line of credit. 

The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants as of December 31, 2023. 

million and million in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. In January 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share payable February 13 , 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 5 , 2024. The indicated annual cash dividend rate is per share.

and removed the Plan s fungible share counting feature. The purpose of the 2019 Omnibus Plan is to provide a means to attract and retain key personnel and to align the interests of the directors, officers, and employees with the Company s shareholders. The plan also provides a vehicle whereby directors and officers may acquire shares in order to meet the ownership requirements under the Company s Stock Ownership Policy. The 2019 Omnibus Plan allows for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units RSUs, performance stock units PSUs and other awards. Except for Restricted Stock Unit RSU grants which are time-based, participants in the Company s Long-Term Equity Compensation Plans are awarded the opportunity to acquire shares over a three-year performance measurement period tied to specific company performance metrics. The number of shares that remain reserved for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan equates to as of December 31, 2023. 

In the first half of fiscal 2024, the Company granted PSUs and RSUs, both with a weighted average market value of . Stock compensation expense was million and million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and million and million in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 

In November of 2021, our board of directors approved the LSI Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP ). A total of shares of common stock were provided for issuance under the ESPP. Employees may participate at their discretion and are able to purchase, through payroll deduction, common stock at a discount on a quarterly basis. Employees may end their participation at any time during the offering period, and participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with the company. During the first half of fiscal year 2024, employees purchased shares. At December 31, 2023, shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP.

The Company has periodically entered into short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. The Company elected not to record these leases on the balance sheet. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the rent expense for these leases is immaterial. 

The Company has certain leases that contain lease and non-lease components and has elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for these components together as a single lease component. 

Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate when determining the present value of lease payments.

Net sales of 109.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, decreased 19.8 million or 15 as compared to net sales of 128.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net sales was attributed to a 2.0 million decrease in net sales of the Lighting Segment, while the remainder of the decrease in net sales was attributable to the Display Solutions Segment. Despite what we believe is a temporary delay in project demand primarily affecting the grocery market of the Display Solutions Segment related to the pending merger of two large grocery industry participants, the Company maintained its focus with ongoing execution in the key markets it serves. 

Net sales of 232.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, decreased 23.4 million or 9 as compared to net sales of 255.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Net sales were driven by decreased net sales of the Lighting Segment (a decrease of 1.9 million or 1 and decreased net sales of the Display Solutions Segment (a decrease of 21.5 million or 18 ).

Operating income of 7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, represents a 1.2 million or 14 decrease from a record operating income of 9.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted operating income, a Non-GAAP measure, was 8.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 10.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP measures. The decline in sales contributed to the decline in operating profit which was partially offset by a 240 basis point increase in gross margin driven by a higher value sales mix, continued sales price disciplines, favorable material input costs, and improved manufacturing productivity. 

Operating income of 18.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, represents a 0.2 million or 1 decrease from operating income of 19.1 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted operating income, a Non-GAAP financial measure, was 21.4 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to same adjusted operating income of 21.4 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022. The Company was able to maintain the same level of operating income despite a 9 decline in sales with continued sales price disciplines, favorable material input costs, and improved manufacturing productivity. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP measures. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We believe it is appropriate to evaluate our performance after making adjustments to the as-reported U.S. GAAP operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Adjusted operating income, net income, and earnings per share, which exclude the impact of long-term performance based compensation expense, severance and restructuring costs, and consulting expense related to commercial growth initiatives, are Non-GAAP financial measures. Also included below are Non-GAAP financial measures including Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA), Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that these adjusted supplemental measures are useful in assessing the operating performance of our business. These supplemental measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results. Although the impacts of some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and could recur in future periods, we exclude these items because they provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations, in that they do not reflect all amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Therefore, these measures should be used only to evaluate our results in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures. Below is a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures to operating income, net income, and earnings per share for the periods indicated along with the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

Operating expenses of 4.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023, decreased 1.1 million from the same period of fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of cost containment initiatives across several of the Company s cost categories. 

Consolidated Results 

The Company reported 0.5 million and 1.3 million of net interest expense in the three months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The Company also recorded a nominal amount of other income which is related to net foreign exchange currency transaction net gains through the Company s Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries. 

The 1.5 million of income tax expense in the three months ended December 31, 2023, represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 20.1 . The 1.4 million of income tax expense in the three months ended December 31, 2022, represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 18.1 . Impacting the effective tax rate of both fiscal years was the favorable tax treatment of the Company s long-term performance based compensation.

Operating expenses of 9.3 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023, decreased 1.8 million from the same period of fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of cost containment initiatives across several of the Company s cost categories. 

Consolidated Results 

The Company reported 1.0 million and 2.0 million of net interest expense in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was the result of the Company s ability to paydown its debt from cash generated by operations. The Company also recorded other expense of 0.1 million and 0.2 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, related to net foreign exchange currency transaction losses through the Company s Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries. 

The 3.8 million of income tax expense in the six months ended December 31, 2023, represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 21.5 . Impacting the effective tax rate was the favorable tax treatment of the Company s long-term performance based compensation. The 4.2 million income tax expense in the six months ended December 31, 2022, represents a consolidated effective tax rate of 24.8 . 

The Company reported net income of 13.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of 12.7 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted net income was 15.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to adjusted net income of 14.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 (Refer to the Non-GAAP tables above). The increase in Non-GAAP adjusted net income is primarily the net result of a decrease in net sales, an increase in the gross profit as a percentage of sales, lower interest expense, and a favorable effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Diluted earnings per share of 0.47 was reported in the six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 0.44 diluted earnings per share in the same period of fiscal 2023. The weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share in the six months ended December 31, 2023, were 29,949,000 shares compared to 28,766,000 shares in the same period last year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company considers its level of cash on hand, borrowing capacity, current ratio and working capital levels to be its most important measures of short-term liquidity. For long-term liquidity indicators, the Company believes its ratio of long-term debt to equity and our historical levels of net cash flows from operating activities to be the most important measures. 

At December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of 75.8 million compared to 73.3 million at June 30, 2023. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.2 to 1 at December 31, 2023, and 2.0 at June 30, 2023. The marginal increase in working capital from June 30, 2023, to December 31, 2023, is primarily driven by a 5.5 million decrease in net accounts receivable and a 3.6 million decrease in net inventory more than offset by a combined decrease of 11.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Net accounts receivable was 72.2 million and 77.7 million at December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, respectively. DSO increased marginally to 58 days at December 31, 2023, from 57 days at June 30, 2023. 

Net inventories of 60.2 million at December 31, 2023, decreased 3.5 million from 63.7 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease of 3.5 million is the result of a decrease in net inventory of 3.0 million in the Lighting Segment and a 0.5 decrease in net inventory in the Display Solutions Segment. 

Cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the Company s line of credit is its primary source of liquidity. In September 2021, the Company amended its existing 100 million secured line of credit, to a 25 million term loan and 75 million remaining as a secured revolving line of credit. Both facilities expire in the third quarter of fiscal 2026. As of December 31, 2023, 70.7 million of the credit line was available. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan covenants. The 100 million credit facility plus cash flows from operating activities are adequate for operational and capital expenditure needs for the remainder of fiscal 2024. 

The Company generated 19.9 million of cash from operating activities in the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a generation of cash of 20.1 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022. The Company continues to effectively manage its working capital while generating increasing cash flow from earnings in both fiscal years, resulting in continued strong cash flow from operations. 

The Company used 3.3 million and 1.0 million of cash related to investing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company has increased its investment in equipment and tooling year-over-year to support sales growth. 

The Company had a use of cash of 15.7 million and 18.8 million related to financing activities in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The use of cash in both fiscal years was primarily the result of cash generated from improved earnings and effective working capital management, which in turn was used to pay down the Company s line of credit. The Company also received 1.2 million and 1.3 million of cash in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, related to the exercise of stock options. This influx of cash also contributed to the pay down of the Company s line of credit. 

The Company has on its balance sheet financial instruments consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, revolving lines of credit, and long-term debt. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying value because of their short-term maturity and/or variable, market-driven interest rates. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk and have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Cash Dividends 

In January 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share payable February 13, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 5, 2024. The indicated annual cash dividend rate for fiscal 2024 is 0.20 per share. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy regarding dividends which indicates that dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion based upon its evaluation of earnings, cash flow requirements, financial condition, debt levels, stock repurchases, future business developments and opportunities, and other factors deemed relevant.

There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk since June 30, 2022. Additional information can be found in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, which appears on page 16 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We conducted, under the supervision of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are fairly presented in all material respects in accordance with GAAP for interim financial statements, and the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified that, based on their knowledge, the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented in this report. 

Changes in Internal Control 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the second quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
