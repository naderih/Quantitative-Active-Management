CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Corporate Governance Framework 

We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of honest and ethical conduct in running our business efficiently, serving our shareholders interests and maintaining our integrity in the marketplace. To assist in its governance, our board has formed two standing committees composed entirely of independent directors, the Audit Committee and the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct, a Whistleblower Policy and an Insider Trading Policy. Copies of our committee charters, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Whistleblower Policy and Insider Trading Policy may be found on our website at www.cbdmd.com. Copies of these materials also are available without charge upon written request to our Corporate Secretary.

Board of Directors 

The board of directors oversees our business affairs and monitors the performance of management. In accordance with our corporate governance principles, the board of directors does not involve itself in day-to-day operations. The directors keep themselves informed through discussions with our President and our Chief Financial Officer, by reading materials that we may send them and by participating in board of directors and committee meetings. Directors are elected for a term of one year, serving until our next annual meeting. Our directors hold office until their successors have been elected and duly qualified unless the director resigns or by reason of death or other cause is unable to serve in the capacity of director. If any director resigns, dies or is otherwise unable to serve out his or her term, or if the board increases the number of directors, the board may fill any vacancy by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum of directors then exists. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor. Vacancies occurring by reason of the removal of directors without cause may only be filled by vote of the shareholders.

The board of directors conducts its business through meetings and actions taken by written consent in lieu of meetings. Our independent directors meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled board meeting. During fiscal 2023, the board of directors held 28 meetings including Annual Meetings. During fiscal 2023, each director attended at least 75 of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the board of directors held during the period of such member s service and (ii) the total number of meetings of the committees of the board of directors on which he served held during the period of such member s service.

Board Leadership Structure and Board s Role in Risk Oversight 

Messrs. Sellers, Raines, and Stephen are each considered an independent director within the meaning of Section 803 of the NYSE American LLC Company Guide. Dr. Swift is an employee of our company. We do not have a lead independent director.

Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks, including operational risk, regulatory risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks we face, while the board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management process designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer attend the board meetings and are available to address any questions or concerns raised by the board on risk management and any other matters. Our employee board member and the independent members of the board work together to provide strong, independent oversight of our company s management and affairs through its standing committees and, when necessary, meetings of independent directors. If the identified risk poses an actual or potential conflict with management, our independent directors may conduct the assessment. Presently, the primary risks affecting us are: (i) our ability to continue as a going concern, (ii) increasing our customer base, (iii) diversifying our sales, and (iv) improving profitability.

Board Committees 

The board of directors has standing Audit, and Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees. Each committee has a written charter. The charters are available on our website at www.cbdmd.com . All committee members are independent directors. Information concerning the current membership and function of each committee is as follows:

Mr. Raines, the chairman of the Audit Committee is considered a financial expert under applicable SEC and NYSE American rules.

Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee

Table of Contents 

Use of Outside Advisors 

All compensation decisions are made with consideration of the committee s guiding principles to provide competitive compensation for the purpose of attracting and retaining talented executives and of motivating our executives to achieve improved cbdMD executive performance, which ultimately benefits our shareholders. The committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate any advisors, including independent counsel, compensation consultants and other advisors to assist as needed, and has sole authority to approve the advisors fees, which will be paid by us, and the other terms and conditions of their engagement. The committee considers input and recommendations from management, including our President and Chief Financial Officer (who are not present during any committee deliberations with respect to compensation) in connection with its review of our compensation programs and its annual review of the performance of the other executive officers. During fiscal 2020 and 2021 the committee engaged the services of an independent compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, to provide it with an executive pay review. The committee takes into consideration the recommendations of the outside compensation consultant and our executive officers but retains absolute discretion as to whether to adopt such recommendations in whole or in part, as it deems appropriate.

As a result of the SEC litigation against our former CEO, the Target provided a demand to Adara that it required cbdMD and Mr. Sumichrast to dispose of our interests in Adara Sponsor, LLC as a condition of proceeding with any business combination. Effective February 10, 2023 we completed the Membership Interest Transfer Agreement and we sold our entire ownership interest in Adara Sponsor, LLC, for the total purchase price of 1,000,000, which constitutes our original purchase price of the interest.
