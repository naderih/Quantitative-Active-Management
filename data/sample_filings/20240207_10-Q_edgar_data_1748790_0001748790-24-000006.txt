 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally identified with words like "believe," "expect," "target," "project," "may," "could," "would," "approximately," "possible," "will," "should," "intend," "plan," "anticipate," "commit," "estimate," "potential," "ambitions," "outlook," or "continue," the negative of these words, other terms of similar meaning, or the use of future dates. Such statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Amcor and are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future ex pectations generally. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Neither Amcor nor any of its respective directors, executive officers, or advisors, provide any representation, assurance, or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries; 
 the loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements, or consolidation among key customers; 
 significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate; 
 an inability to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including product innovation, investments, or acquisitions; 
 challenging current and future global economic conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflation; 
 impacts of operating internationally; 
 price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs, which could adversely affect our business; 
 production, supply, and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic volatility; 
 pandemics, epidemics, or other disease outbreaks; 
 an inability to attract and retain our global executive management team and our skilled workforce; 
 costs and liabilities related to environment, health, and safety ("EHS") laws and regulations, as well as changes in the global climate;

 risks related to climate change; 
 cybersecurity risks, which could disrupt our operations or risk of loss of our sensitive business information; 
 failures or disruptions in our information technology systems which could disrupt our operations, compromise customer, employee, supplier, and other data; 
 rising interest rates that increase our borrowing costs on our variable rate indebtedness and could have other negative impacts; 
 a significant increase in our indebtedness or a downgrade in our credit rating could reduce our operating flexibility and increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations; 
 foreign exchange rate risk; 
 a significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets; 
 a failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; 
 an inability of our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, to provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face; 
 an inability to defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property infringement claims against us; 
 litigation, including product liability claims, or regulatory developments; 
 increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and government s with respect to our Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") practices and commitments resulting in additional costs or exposure to additional risks; 
 changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters, including climate change; and 
 changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings. 
 
 These risks and uncertainties are supplemented by those identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including without limitation, those described under Part I, "Item 1A - Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and as updated by our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

 Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 that adds new reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The new standard's amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods beginning July 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning July 1, 2025, with e arly adoption permitted, and will be applied retrospectively to all periods in the financial statements. The Company will adopt this guidance in fiscal year 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its disclosures. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 that adds new income tax disclosure requirements, primarily related to existing income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The new standard's amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods beginning July 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its disclosures. 
 
 The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. The Company determined at this time that all other ASUs not yet adopted are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and disclosures.

 million plus the assumption of debt of million. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and the Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. 
 
 Fiscal Year 2023 - Acquisitions 
 
 On May 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a New Zealand based leading manufacturer of state-of-the-art, automated protein packaging machines. The purchase consideration of million is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes contingent consideration of million, to be earned and paid in cash over the two years following the acquisition date, subject to meeting certain performance targets. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired identifiable net assets of million and goodwill of million. Goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent consideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of December 31, 2023 using information available as of the acquisition date, and are considered preliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. 
 
 On March 17, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a equity interest in a medical device packaging manufacturing site in Shanghai, China. The purchase consideration of million includes contingent consideration of million, to be earned and paid in cash over the three years following the acquisition date, subject to meeting certain performance targets. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired identifiable net assets of million and goodwill of million. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent consideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of December 31, 2023 using information available as of the acquisition date, and are considered preliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition. 
 
 The fair value estimates for all three acquisitions in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. Pro forma information related to these acquisitions has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material. 
 
 Fiscal Year 2023 - Disposal 
 
 On December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash proceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale followed the Company s previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its Russian business. The total net cash consideration received, excluding disposed cash and items settled net, was million and resulted in a net pre-tax net gain of million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by million in the quarter end ed June 30, 2022 . The impairment charge was based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the wide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business was recorded as restructuring and other related activities, net within the condensed consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a net carrying value of million, including allocated goodwill of million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of million, primarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.

 million and million during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and million and million during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's restructuring activities for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 were primarily comprised of restructuring activities related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan (as defined below). The Company's restructuring activities in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 related to Other Restructuring Plans (as defined below). 
 
 Restructuring related expenses are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on its restructuring activities. 
 
 2023 Restructuring Plan 
 
 On February 7, 2023, the Company announced that it will allocate approximately million to million of the sale proceeds from the Russian business to various cost saving initiatives to partly offset divested earnings from the Russian business (the "2023 Restructuring Plan" or the "Plan"). The Company expects the total Plan cash and non-cash net expenses to total approximately million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has initiated projects with an expected net cost of approximately million, of which million relates to employee related expenses, million to fixed asset related expenses (net of expected gains on asset disposals), million to other restructuring expenses, and million to restructuring related expenses. The projects initiated as of December 31, 2023 are expected to result in approximately million of net cash expenditures. The Plan includes both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging reportable segments and is expected to be largely completed by the end of calendar year 2024. 
 
 From the initiation of the Plan through December 31, 2023, the Company has incurred million in employee related expenses, million in fixed asset related expenses, million in other restructuring, and million in restructuring related expenses, with million incurred in the Flexibles reportable segment and million incurred in the Rigid Packaging reportable segment. The Plan has resulted in cumulative net cash outflows of million. Additional cash payments of approximately million to million, net of estimated proceeds from disposals, are expected for the remainder of the fiscal year 2024, the majority of which relates to the Flexibles reportable segment. 
 
 The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include startup and training costs after relocation of equipment, and other costs incidental to the Plan. 
 
 Other Restructuring Plans 
 
 The Company has entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). Expenses incurred on such programs are primarily costs to move equipment and other costs.

Note 7 - 

The carrying value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles. 

billion. These contracts are considered to be economic hedges and the related billion notional amount of commercial paper is also excluded from the total long-term debt with fixed interest rates. 
 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 Additionally, the Company measures and records certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent purchase consideration liabilities, at fair value.

Interest rate swaps Total assets measured at fair value Liabilities Contingent purchase consideration Commodity contracts Forward exchange contracts Interest rate swaps Total liabilities measured at fair value 

Contingent purchase consideration liabilities arise from business acquisitions and other investments . As of December 31, 2023, the Company had contingent purchase consideration liabilities of million, consisting of million of contingent purchase consideration predominantly relating to fiscal year 2023 acquisitions (refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions and Disposals") and a million liability that is contingent on future royalty income generated by Discma AG, a subsidiary acquired in March 2017. The fair values of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities were determined for each arrangement individually. The fair values were determined using an income approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the selection of discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability adjusted financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which require adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities. Changes arising from modifications in forecasts related to contingent consideration are not expected to be material. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 , income of million was recorded in other income/(expenses), net from remeasuring the fair value of the Company's contingent purchase consideration liability. 
 
 The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

During the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were impairment charges recorded on indefinite-lived intangibles, including goodwill. For information on long-lived asset impairments, refer to Note 5, "Restructuring". 
 18 

Note 8 - 

In March 2023, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of billion. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company pays a weighted-average fixed interest rate of and receives a variable rate of interest, based on 1-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") , from July 2023 through June 2024, settled monthly.

The Company has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the recorded accrual of million as of December 31, 2023. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company's estimates.

 Contingencies - Environmental Matters 
 
 The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or may only partially, cover the total potential exposures. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded aggregate accruals of million for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites. 
 
 In addition to the matters described above, as of December 31, 2023, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated. 
 
 The SEC requires the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceeding may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of 1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters required to be disclosed for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless, based on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition.

Overview 
 
 Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal care, and other products. We work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2023, Amcor generated 14.7 billion in net sales. 

Significant Developments Affecting the Periods Presented 
 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 
 As anticipated, market conditions have continued to remain challenging in the first half of fiscal year 2024, with softer customer demand and increased destocking in the second quarter, particularly in December, of fiscal year 2024. We also continue to be impacted by higher inflation in certain areas, such as labor costs . In addition, higher inflation, especially in Europe and the United States, has led central banks to rapidly raise interest rates to dampen inflation which has resulted in higher interest expense on our variable rate debt, particularly on U.S. dollar and Euro denominated debt in the first half of fiscal year 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2023. 
 
 The underlying causes for the continued market volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine and the Gaza-Israel conflicts and higher inflation in many economies, which have resulted in increased volatility in food and other markets and impacted global economies. In this context, we remain focused on taking price and cost actions to offset inflation, aligning our cost base with market dynamics, and managing working capital. Improved operating leverage, combined with known benefits in the second half of fiscal year 2024, which include the elimination of the earnings headwinds from the sale of the three manufacturing facilities in Russia ("Russian business"), a lower interest expense headwind, and the realization of structural cost reduction and productivity initiatives, is expected to result in improved earnings in the second half of fiscal year 2024. However, there is no assurance that we will meet our performance expectations or that ongoing geopolitical tensions and other factors will not negatively impact our financial results. 
 
 Russia-Ukraine Conflict / 2023 Restructuring Plan 
 
 Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of the filing of this quarterly report. In advance of the invasion, we proactively suspended operations at our small manufacturing site in Ukraine. We also operated our Russian business until its sale on December 23, 2022, for net cash proceeds of 365 million. In addition, we repatriated approximately 65 million in cash held in Russia as part of the transaction. We recorded a pre-tax net gain on sale of 215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by 90 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2022. 
 
 On February 7, 2023, we announced that we expect to invest 110 million to 130 million of the sale proceeds from the Russian business in various cost savings initiatives to partly offset divested earnings from the Russian business (the "2023 Restructuring Plan" or the "Plan"). We expect total Plan cash and non-cash net expenses of approximately 230 million. Of the remaining cash received from the sale of the Russian business, we allocated 100 million to the repurchase of additional shares and the remainder was used to reduce debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, we have initiated restructuring and related projects with an expected net cost of approximately 210 million, of which approximately 110 million is expected to result in net cash expenditures. From the initiation of the Plan until December 31, 2023, we have incurred 77 million in employee-related expenses, 25 million in fixed asset related expenses, 27 million in other restructuring, and 13 million in restructuring related expenses. The Plan has resulted in 49 million of cash outflows to date. 
 
 Management initiated other restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 to help mitigate the impact of the Russian sale. Management expects to realize an annualized pre-tax benefit of approximately 50 million from structural cost reduction actions taken as a result of all Russia related restructuring by the end of fiscal year 2025.

Highly Inflationary Accounting 
 
 We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. Following the governmental election in the three months ended December 31, 2023, Argentina devalued the Argentine Peso by approximately 55 against the U.S. dollar. As a result, highly inflationary accounting in the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 resulted in a negative impact on monetary assets of 34 million and 5 million, respectively, and 51 million and 13 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in foreign currency transaction losses that were reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Our operations in Argentina represented approximately 2 of our consolidated net sales and annual adjusted earnings before interest and tax in fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Information 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT"), earnings before interest and tax ("EBIT"), adjusted net income, and net debt. Such measures have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery, certain regulatory and litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction and integration expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition payments and economic hedging instruments on commercial paper, and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in Adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income and the acquired assets contribute to revenue generation. 
 
 This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Refer to Note 2, "New Accounting Guidance," in "Item 1. Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements". 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. There have been no material changes in critical accounting estimates and judgments as of December 31, 2023 from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources. 
 
 We believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market, backstopped by our bank debt facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, into the foreseeable future. 
 
 Overview 
 Six Months Ended December 31, in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities 228 145 Net cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (256) 24 Net cash used in financing activities (191) (90) 
 
 Cash Flow Overview 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 83 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily driven by lower working capital outflows more than offsetting lower net income in the current period. 
 
 Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 280 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily driven by the disposal proceeds collected from the sale of the Russian business in the prior period, partially offset by lower outflows for investments in affiliated companies and business acquisitions compared to the prior period. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased by 101 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily driven by lower net debt drawdowns in the current period. 
 
 Net Debt 
 
 We borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings. 
 
 In March 2023, we entered into two interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of 1.2 billion. Under the terms of the contracts, we pay a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 3.88 and receive a variable rate of interest based on 1-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") . The swaps have been effective as of July 1, 2023, and mature on June 30, 2024. The interest rate swap contracts economically hedge the SOFR component of our forecasted commercial paper issuances. 
 
 Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date. 
 46 

Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to 10.0 of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the covenants of the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.9 times. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities. 
 
 Our net debt as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 was 6.6 billion and 6.1 billion, respectively. 
 
 Debt Facilities 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of 1.0 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by two bank syndicates. These facilities mature in April 2025 and April 2027, respectively, and the revolving tranches have two 12-month options available to us to extend the maturity date. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of 3.8 billion, of which 2.8 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). Subject to certain conditions, we can request the total commitment level under each agreement to be increased by up to 500 million. 
 
 Dividend Payments 
 
 We declared and paid a 0.1225 cash dividend per ordinary share during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a 0.1250 cash dividend per ordinary share during the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Credit Rating 
 
 Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various terms, and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets, and from global financial institutions. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 On February 7, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 100 million buyback of ordinary shares and/or CHESS Depositary Instruments ("CDIs") in the following twelve months. On February 6, 2024, our Board of Directors extended the approval for the remaining 39 million of ordinary shares and CDIs of the 100 million buyback until June 30, 2024 . During the six months ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 30 million of ordinary shares and CDIs in the aggregate, including transaction costs, or 3 million shares. The shares repurchased as part of the program were canceled upon repurchase. 
 
 We had cash outflows of 48 million and 221 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market and using forward contracts to purchase our own equity during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, we held treasury shares at a cost of 11 million and 12 million, respectively, representing 1 million shares.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
