 PART I 
 
 Item l. Business. 
 General 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that owns, operates, and to a lesser extent, holds interests in joint ventures that own and operate multi-family properties. At December 31, 2023, we (i) wholly-own 21 multi-family properties with an aggregate of 5,420 units and a carrying value of 634.0 million; (ii) have ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in seven multi-family properties with an aggregate of 2,287 units for which the carrying value of our net equity investment therein is 30.4 million; and (iii) own other assets, through consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, with a carrying value of 5.6 million. The 28 multi-family properties are located in 11 states primarily located in the Southeast United States and Texas. 
 Our website can be accessed at www.brtapartments.com , where copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, can be obtained free of charge. 
 
 2023 and Recent Developments. 
 
 During 2023: 
 The unconsolidated joint venture that owned Chatham Court and Reflections, a 494 unit multi-family property located in Dallas, TX, and in which we had a 50 interest, sold such property. Our share of the (i) gain from this sale was 14.7 million, (ii) related early extinguishment of debt charge was 212,000, and (iii) net proceeds from the sale, after the payoff of the related mortgage debt, were 19.4 million. In 2023 and 2022, this property accounted for 54,000 and 753,000, respectively, of equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 We paid off our credit facility debt of 19.0 million - we accomplished this by using the proceeds of new mortgage debt of 21.2 million placed on our Silvana Oaks - North Charleston, SC multi-family property; such mortgage debt matures in March 2033, bears an interest rate of 4.45 and is interest only for the term of the mortgage. 
 
 We repurchased 779,423 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 14.4 million i.e ., an average price per share of 18.47). 
 
 From January 1, 2024 through March 1, 2024, we purchased 123,061 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2.3 million i.e., average price of 18.43 per share).

 Our Multi-Family Properties 
 Generally, our multi-family properties are garden apartment, mid-rise or town home style properties that provide residents with amenities, such as a clubhouse, swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television access. Residential leases are typically for a one-year term and may require security deposits equal to one month's rent. Substantially all of the units at these properties are leased at market rates. Set forth below is selected information regarding the multi-family properties in which we have an interest, as of December 31, 2023; the properties in which we have a less than 100 ownership interest are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures:

Our Acquisition Process and Underwriting Criteria 
 
 We identify multi-family property acquisition opportunities primarily through relationships developed with, among others, current or former joint venture partners, real estate investors and brokers. We will acquire multi-family properties with joint venture partners (and especially with partner s experienced in the target market), which allows us to benefit from such partner s experience, or directly i.e. , without a joint venture partner) which allows for the (i) possibility for greater returns on our investment and (ii) the consolidation in our financial statements of the accounts and operations of such acquired properties, which investors may find more attractive and understandable than the presentation of information on an unconsolidated basis. 
 
 We emphasize acquiring the following types of multi-family properties: 
 Class B or better properties with strong and stable cash flows in markets where we believe there exists opportunity for rental growth and further value creation; 
 Class B or better properties that offer significant potential for capital appreciation through repositioning or rehabilitating the asset to drive rental growth; and 
 properties available at opportunistic prices providing an opportunity for a significant appreciation in value.

 We seek properties that provide stable risk adjusted total returns i.e., operating income plus capital appreciation), including value-add opportunities i.e. , properties that can be repositioned or improved allowing us to generate higher rents or improved occupancy) and emphasize acquiring properties in the Southeast United States and Texas. We have been opportunistic in pursuing multi-family property acquisitions and have not mandated any specific acquisition criteria, although we take the following, among other things, into account in evaluating an acquisition opportunity: location, demographics, size of the target market, property quality, availability and terms and conditions of long-term fixed-rate mortgage debt, potential for capital appreciation or recurring income, extent and nature of contemplated capital improvements and property age. 
 A key consideration in our acquisition process is the availability of mortgage debt to finance the acquisition (or the ability to assume the mortgage debt on the property) and the terms and conditions e.g ., interest rate, amortization and maturity) of such debt. Generally, approximately 35 to 50 of the purchase price has been paid in cash (all or a portion of our share of which may be funded by borrowing from our credit facility) and the balance is financed with mortgage debt. We believe that the use of leverage allows us the ability to earn a greater return on our investment than we would otherwise earn. Generally, the mortgage debt obtained in connection with an acquisition matures in five to ten years, is interest only for one to five years, and provides for a fixed interest rate and for the amortization of the principal of such debt over 30 years. 
 Potential acquisitions are reviewed and approved by our investment committee. Approval requires the assent of not less than five of the eight members of this committee, all of whom are our executive officers. Board of director approval is required for any single multi-family property acquisition in which our equity investment exceeds 40 million. 
 From time-to-time we have pursued development opportunities with joint venture partners when we believe the potential higher returns justify the additional risks. The factors considered in pursuing these opportunities generally include the factors considered in evaluating a standard acquisition opportunity, and we place additional emphasis on our joint venture partner's ability to execute a development project. In 2022, we acquired, for 3.5 million, a 17.45 interest in a planned 240-unit development property located in Johns Island, SC and in 2023, in response to capital calls, invested an additional 316,000 in this project. This project is our only development project. At December 31, 2023, this project is substantially complete and lease-up has begun at this property. We estimate that for 2024, we will record approximately 350,000 to 500,000 of equity in loss from unconsolidated ventures related to this property because the venture will begin recognizing revenue and expenses and in particular depreciation and interest which had been capitalized during the development phase). We do not anticipate development properties will constitute a significant part of our portfolio. 
 In light of the challenging acquisition environment and the limited funds available to us to acquire properties, we may, in the near term, pursue alternative investments in the multi-family property arena, such as rescue capital, which includes preferred equity investments e.g., an investment entitling the investor to a fixed rate of return prior to distributions to more junior investors) or bridge loans e.g., a loan secured by a first mortgage on the subject property). We can provide no assurance that we will pursue such investments or that if we do, such investments will be profitable for us. We do not anticipate that these type of alternative investments will constitute a significant part of our portfolio. 
 It is our policy, and the policy of our affiliated entities (as described below), that any investment opportunity presented to us or to any of our affiliated entities that involves the acquisition of a multi-family property with more than 100 units, will first be offered to us and may not be pursued by any of our affiliated entities unless we decline the opportunity. Our affiliated entities include Gould Investors L.P., a master limited partnership involved primarily in the ownership and operation of a diversified portfolio of real estate assets, One Liberty Properties, Inc., a NYSE listed net lease industrial focused REIT, and Majestic Property Management Corp., a property management company, which is wholly owned by Fredric H. Gould, a director. Gould Investors has purchased multifamily properties in the Southeast United States; all of such properties have less than 100 units. We have not been interested in acquiring any of the properties purchased by Gould Investors. 
 Property and Joint Venture Dispositions 
 We monitor our portfolio to identify properties that should be sold. Factors considered in deciding whether to sell a property generally include our evaluation of the current market price of such property compared to its projected economics (including the age of the property and anticipated maintenance costs), changes in the factors considered by us in acquiring such property, the ability to reinvest net proceeds from a sale into a more favorable acquisition opportunity or other productive purpose e.g ., repayment of debt), our liquidity requirements and, with respect to properties that are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, our partners' desires with respect thereto. If our partners deem it in their own economic interest to dispose of a property at an earlier date than we would otherwise dispose of a property, we may accommodate such request and agree to sell the property to a third party or attempt to purchase our partner's interest.

 Joint Venture Arrangements 
 The arrangements with our multi-family property joint venture partners are deal-specific and vary from transaction-to- transaction. Generally, these arrangements provide for us and our joint venture partner to receive net cash flow available for distribution and/or profits in the following order of priority: (i) a preferred return o f 8 to 10 on each party's unreturned capital contributions, until such preferred return has been paid in full; and (ii) the return in full of each party's capital contribution (and together with the preferred return, the "Mandatory Return"). Thereafter, distributions to, and profit sharing between, joint venture partners, is determined pursuant to the applicable agreement governing the relationship between the parties. The allocation and distribution of cash and profits to BRT after the Mandatory Return is generally less than that implied by BRT's percentage equity interest in the venture/property as a result of allocation/distribution provisions of our joint venture operating agreements. 
 
 Although as noted above each joint venture operating agreement contains different terms, such agreements may limit our right to vote and receive dividends and distributions. Further, such agreements generally provide for a buy-sell procedure under specified circumstances, including, (i) if the partners are unable to agree on major decisions or (ii) upon a change in control of our subsidiary owning the interest in the joint venture. Further, these arrangements may also allow us, and in some cases, our joint venture partner, to force the sale of the property after it has been owned by the joint venture for a specified period e.g ., four to five years after the acquisition). 
 
 Property Management 
 The day-to-day management of our multi-family properties is overseen by property management companies operating in the market in which the property is located. (Four of our seven joint venture properties are managed by management companies that are owned by a joint venture partner or its affiliates). The property management companies that manage our properties are paid fees ranging from 2 to 4 of revenues generated by the applicable property. Generally, we can terminate these management companies upon specified notice or for cause, subject to the approval of the mortgage lender and, in some cases, our joint venture partner. We believe satisfactory replacements for property managers are available, if required. 
 Mortgage Debt and Other Real Estate Financings 
 In acquiring properties, we use fixed rate mortgage debt to pay from 50 to 65 of the purchase price. Although fixed rate mortgage debt is typically more expensive and less flexible than variable rate mortgage debt e.g. , the interest rate is higher at origination and there are typically high prepayment penalties, yield maintenance payments and/or defeasance penalties when refinancing the debt prior to maturity), we prefer using such debt as it caps our exposure to fluctuating interest rates. We also from time to time obtain supplemental mortgage debt on an acquired property which, among other things, allows us to generate additional cash resulting from the appreciation of the value of the property. As of December 31, 2023, 18 of our 21 wholly owned properties are subject to fixed-rate mortgage debt; our interests in the three remaining wholly-owned properties have been pledged to our credit facility lender. At December 31, 2023, the weighted average annual interest rate on these mortgages was 4.02 and the weighted average remaining term to maturity of such debt is 7.0 years. 
 
 Each of our seven unconsolidated multi-family properties are subject to fixed-rate mortgage debt and our development project is subject to a variable-rate construction loan. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average annual interest rate of the mortgage and construction debt on these multi-family properties is 4.32 and the weighted average remaining term to maturity of such debt is 5.0 years.

 The following table sets forth scheduled principal (including amortization) mortgage payments due for all of our multi-family properties as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 (1) Does not give effect to mortgage fair value adjustments of 1.4 million. 
 (2) Includes all of the mortgage debt on properties owned by such joint venture. 
 
 The mortgage debt associated with our multi-family properties, including the mortgage debt at our significant subsidiaries generally contain covenants, including covenants that require, (i) the guarantor of the mortgage debt to maintain a certain level of net worth and liquid assets or (ii) in connection with the sale or other transfer of the property, the mortgage debt to be paid off (or assumed by the buyer with the consent of the mortgage lender). The mortgage debt is generally non-recourse to us and the entity that owns the property, subject to standard carve-outs. We, at the parent entity level i.e ., BRT Apartments Corp.), are the standard carve-out guarantor with respect to our wholly owned properties. (The term "standard carve-outs" refers to recourse items to an otherwise non-recourse mortgage and are customary to mortgage financing. While carve-outs vary from lender to lender and transaction to transaction, the carve-outs may include, among other things, a voluntary bankruptcy filing, environmental liabilities, the sale, financing or encumbrance of the property in violation of loan documents, damage to property as a result of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, failure to pay valid taxes and other claims which could create a lien on a property and the conversion of security deposits, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards). At December 31, 2023, the principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding with respect to the properties at which we are the carve-out guarantor is approximately 419.3 million. 
 Corporate Level Financing Arrangements 
 See " Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Corporate Level Financing Arrangements " for information about our corporate level financing arrangements. 
 Insurance 
 The multi-family properties are covered by all risk property insurance covering 100 of the replacement cost for each building and business interruption and rental loss insurance (covering up to twelve months of loss). On a case-by-case basis, based on an assessment of the likelihood of the risk, availability of insurance, cost of insurance and in accordance with standard market practice, we obtain earthquake, windstorm, flood, terrorism and boiler and machinery insurance. We carry comprehensive liability insurance and umbrella policies for each of our properties which generally provide no less than 10 million to 25 million of coverage per incident. We request certain extension of coverage, valuation clauses, and deductibles in accordance with standard market practice and availability. 
 Although we may carry insurance for potential losses associated with our multi-family properties, we may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material. In addition, insurance coverage at our unconsolidated properties is provided through blanket policies obtained by our joint venture partners or the property managers for such property. A consequence of obtaining insurance coverage in this manner is that losses on properties in which we have no ownership interest could reduce significantly or eliminate the coverage available on one or more properties in which we have an interest. 
 Our Other Real Estate Assets and Activities 
 In addition to our multi-family properties, we own assets, and in particular, real estate assets, with an aggregate carrying value of 5.6 million at December 31, 2023. These assets include cooperative apartment units located in Lawrence and Washington Heights, NY, a leasehold position with two commercial tenants at a property in Yonkers, NY, an equity interest in a development project, which is substantially complete, in John's Island, SC and a nominal profit participation in an entity that 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 owns several multi-family properties in Newark, NJ. None of these assets generate significant net income or revenue other than the leasehold interest which generated 1.3 million of rental income and 1.1 million of cash flow from operation in 2023 before giving effect to the non-controlling interest. See notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Competition 
 We compete to acquire multi-family properties with pension and investment funds, real estate developers, private real estate investors and other owners and operators of such properties. Competition to acquire such properties, among other things, is based on price, the ability to secure financing on a timely basis to complete the acquisition, an extensive network able to introduce us to appropriate acquisition opportunities and the ability to absorb certain risks that we may be unwilling to absorb (and that larger competitors may be willing to absorb). 
 We compete for tenants at our multi-family properties such competition depends upon various factors, including alternative housing options available in the applicable sub-market, rent, amenities provided and proximity to employment and quality of life venues. 
 Many of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources than we possess. To the extent that a potential joint venture introduces us to a multi-family acquisition opportunity, we compete with other sources of equity capital to participate in such joint venture based on the financial returns we are willing to offer such potential partner and the other terms and conditions of the such arrangement. 
 Government Regulation 
 Multifamily properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, such as swimming pools, activity centers, and recreational facilities. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. 
 Americans with Disabilities Act 
 Our properties must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which we refer to as the "ADA". Among other things, the ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Our obligations under the ADA are ongoing and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate. 
 Fair Housing Act 
 The Fair Housing Act, which we refer to as the "FHA", its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (disability) and, in some jurisdictions, financial capability or other bases. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in litigation, fines, penalties or other adverse claims, or could result in limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. We believe that we operate our properties in substantial compliance with the FHA. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to regulation at the federal, state and municipal levels and are exposed to potential liability should our properties or actions result in damage to the environment or to other persons or properties. These conditions include the presence or growth of mold, potential leakage of underground storage tanks, breakage or leaks from sewer lines and risks pertaining to waste handling. The potential costs of compliance, property damage restoration and other costs for which we could be liable or which could occur without regard to our fault or knowledge, are unknown and could potentially be material. There are no material claims made or pending against us with regard to environmental damage, nor are we aware of any potential environmental hazards related to any of our properties which could reasonably be expected to result in a material loss. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 10 full-time employees who devote substantially all of their business time to us. In addition, part-time personnel (including part-time executive officers), perform certain executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical functions for us. The services of the part-time personnel as well as the provision to us of certain facilities and other resources are supplied pursuant to a shared services agreement between us and several affiliated entities, including Gould Investors L.P., the owner and operator of a diversified portfolio of real estate and other assets. The expenses 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 for the shared personnel, facilities and resources is allocated to us and the other affiliated entities in accordance with the shared services agreement. The allocation is based on the estimated time devoted by such part-time personnel to the affairs of the parties to this agreement. 
 We also retain several related parties, among other things, to analyze and approve multi-family property acquisitions and dispositions, develop and maintain banking and financing relationships and provide investment advice and long-term planning (the Services ). The aggregate fees to be paid in 2024, and paid in 2023 and 2022, for the Services, are 1.62 million, 1.54 million and 1.47 million, respectively. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the shared services agreement and the Services. 
 We provide a competitive benefits program to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, the program includes annual cash bonuses, stock awards, pension plan contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, paid-time off, family leave and an education benefit. Employees are offered flexibility to meet personal and family needs and regular opportunities to participate in professional development programs. Most of our employees have a long tenure with us, which we believe is indicative of the employee-friendly work environment we provide. 
 We maintain a work environment that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law, and our employees are compensated in a manner unrelated to their inclusion in any of the foregoing categories. 
 These workplace protections and compensation benefits are afforded to the part-time personnel providing services to us pursuant to the shared services agreement.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Set forth below is a discussion of certain risks affecting our business. The categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit your consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories.Any adverse effects arising from the realization of any of the risks discussed, including our financial condition and results of operation, may, and likely will, adversely affect many aspects of our business. 
 
 Risks Related to Real Estate Investments and Our Operations 
 Unfavorable market and economic conditions could adversely affect rental revenues, occupancy levels and the value of our properties. 
 General economic conditions in the U.S. have fluctuated significantly in recent quarters with the U.S. experiencing negative macroeconomic conditions such as increasing inflationary and labor market concerns. Unfavorable market and economic conditions may significantly affect our occupancy levels, our rental rates and collections, the value of our properties and our ability to acquire or dispose of multifamily properties on economically favorable terms. Our ability to lease our multifamily properties at favorable rates is adversely affected by the increase in supply in the multifamily and other rental markets and is dependent upon the overall level in the economy, which may continue to be adversely affected by, among other things, inflationary conditions, job losses and unemployment levels, personal debt levels, a downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility, and uncertainty about the future. Some of our major expenses generally do not decline when related rents decline. We would expect that declines in our occupancy levels, rental revenues and/or the values of our multi-family properties would cause us to have less cash available to make payments on our debt and to pay dividends, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of our securities. 
 We may be unable to compete to acquire, finance or dispose of our properties or to lease rental units. 
 We compete with many third parties including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private investors, investment and pension funds, in acquiring, obtaining financing for, and disposing of multi-family properties. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Larger and more established competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, enhanced operating efficiencies and more extensive networks providing greater and more favorable access to capital, financing and tax credit allocations and more favorable acquisition opportunities. 
 In attracting and retaining residents to occupy our multi-family properties, we compete with numerous other housing providers. Our multi-family properties compete directly with other rental apartments, as well as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price charged, attractiveness of the location of multi-family properties, and the quality and breadth of services. The number of competitive properties relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease our properties and on the rents we charge. 
 Increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results 
 The cost of real estate taxes, utilities and insurance is a significant component of real estate operating expense. These expenses are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, including the impact of inflation, which we may be unable to control. For example, our real estate taxes have increased and will continue to increase as our properties are reassessed by 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 taxing authorities and as property tax rates increase. Further, our real estate taxes have fluctuated and may not be comparable year-over-year because of, among other things, (i) the timing difference as to when we accrue real estate taxes and the results of any tax appeals with respect to such accrued taxes and (ii) determinations, over which we have no control, by governmental authorities to increase tax rates, assessments or procedures. We anticipate that our insurance costs will continue to increase because of our implementation, in 2022, of a master insurance program that directly covers our wholly-owned properties (as opposed to coverage obtained by our property managers), the casualty losses that we have sustained the past several years and general increases in the cost of insurance coverage for multi-family properties. In addition, our share of the insurance premiums at joint venture properties is determined by our joint venture partner at such properties. If the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected. 
 
 Most of our multi-family properties are located in the Southeast and Texas which makes us susceptible to adverse developments in such markets. 
 The operating performance and value of our multi-family properties is impacted by the economic environment and other conditions of the specific markets in which our properties are concentrated. As of December 31, 2023: (i) our wholly-owned properties generated approximately 75 and 10 of our 2023 revenues from properties located in the Southeast and Texas, respectively, and (ii) the properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures at December 31, 2023, generated 53 and 47 of our 2023 JV Rental and Other Revenues at properties located in Texas and the Southeast, respectively. Accordingly, adverse developments in such markets, including economic developments, pandemics, or natural or man-made disasters, could adversely impact the cash flow and value of these properties. The concentration of our properties in the Southeast United States and Texas exposes us to risks of adverse developments which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more geographically diverse portfolio. 
 The failure of property management companies to properly manage our properties could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 We rely on property management companies to manage our properties. These management companies are responsible for, among other things, leasing and marketing rental units, selecting tenants (including an evaluation of the creditworthiness of tenants), collecting rent, paying operating expenses and maintaining our properties . If these property management companies do not perform their duties properly, or, in the case of unconsolidated properties, we and/or our joint venture partners do not effectively supervise the activities of these managers, the occupancy rates and rental rates at the properties managed by such property managers may decline and the expenses at such properties may increase. At December 31, 2023, one property manager manages ten properties, a second property manager manages seven properties, and five other property managers manage four or fewer properties. Four properties are managed by a management company owned by or affiliated with a joint venture partner. The loss of our property managers, and in particular, the managers that manage multiple properties, could result in a decrease in occupancy rates, rental rates or both or an increase in expenses. Further, except for our multi-family properties covered by our master insurance program, property managers are also generally responsible for obtaining insurance coverage with respect to the properties they manage, which coverage is often obtained pursuant to blanket policies covering many properties in which we have no interest. Losses at properties managed by our property managers but in which we have no interest could reduce significantly the insurance coverage available at our properties managed by these property managers. It may be difficult to terminate a non-performing management company, particularly a management company owned or affiliated with a joint venture, because such termination may require the approval of the mortgagee, our joint venture partner or both. If we are unable to terminate an underperforming property manager on a timely basis, our occupancy and rental rates may decrease and our expenses may increase. 
 Our efforts to buy properties directly may involve greater risks than buying properties with joint venture partners. 
 Although historically we have acquired properties with joint venture partners with knowledge of the local markets in which we were acquiring properties, we are working to buy properties directly without joint venture partners. In buying properties directly, we do not have the benefit of a partner s understanding of the target markets nor the equity they would have contributed to the acquisition. We cannot provide any assurance that we will properly evaluate the acquisition opportunities we pursue in buying properties directly.

 Risks involved in conducting real estate activity through joint ventures. 
 Seven of our multi-family properties are owned through joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks not otherwise present when acquiring real estate directly, including the following: 
 our joint venture partners may have economic or business interests or objectives which are or become inconsistent with our business interests or objectives, including differing objectives relating to the sale or refinancing of properties held by the joint venture or the timing of the termination or liquidation of the joint venture; 
 the more successful a joint venture project, the more likely that profits or distributions generated above a negotiated threshold will be allocated disproportionately in favor of our joint venture partner at a rate greater than that implied by our partner's equity interest in the venture; 
 several of our joint venture partners have other competing real estate interests in the markets in which our properties are located that could influence such partners to take actions favoring their properties to the detriment of the jointly owned properties; 
 our joint venture partners obtain blanket property casualty and business interruption insurance insuring properties we own jointly and other properties in which we have no ownership interest and as a result, claims or losses with respect to properties owned by our joint venture partners but in which we have no interest could significantly reduce or eliminate the insurance available to properties in which we have an interest; 
 our joint venture partner might become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise refuse or be unable to meet their obligations to us or the venture (including their obligation to make capital contributions or property distributions when due); 
 we may incur liabilities as a result of action taken by our joint venture partner; 
 our joint venture partner may not perform its property oversight responsibilities; 
 our joint venture partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests, including actions that may make it more difficult to maintain our qualification as a REIT; 
 our joint venture partner might engage in unlawful or fraudulent conduct with respect to our jointly owned properties or other properties in which they have an ownership interest; 
 changes in personnel managing our joint venture partners have resulted in greater difficulty in working with the new personnel; 
 our joint venture partner may trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction; 
 disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and divert management's attention from operating our business; and 
 disagreements with our joint venture partners with respect to property management (including with respect to whether a property should be sold, refinanced, or improved) could result in an impasse resulting in the inability to operate the property effectively. 
 Joint venture partners have acted without our authorization e.g ., a partner modified a mortgage term without our consent). We also have had, and expect to continue to have, disagreements with joint venture partners over various issues including, among others, as to whether, and the extent to which, value add programs should be implemented at a property, whether a mortgage debt on a property should be refinanced and the terms and conditions of such refinancing, and, because our joint venture structure may incentivize our joint venture partner to sell the property sooner than we would otherwise desire, the timing and terms and conditions of property sales. 
 Our operating results are significantly influenced by demand for multi-family properties generally, and a decrease in such demand will likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. 
 Our current portfolio is focused on multi-family properties, and we expect that going forward we will continue to focus on the acquisition, disposition and operation of such properties. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry, and a decrease in the demand for multi-family properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio.

 Our operating results and assets may be negatively affected if our insurance coverage is insufficient to compensate us for casualty events occurring at our properties. 
 Our multi-family properties, including the properties owned by the joint ventures in which we are members, carry all risk property insurance covering the property and improvements thereto for the cost of replacement in the event of a casualty. Though we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses sustained as a result of a casualty because, among other things: 
 the amount of insurance coverage maintained for a property may be insufficient to pay the full replacement cost following a casualty event; 
 the rent loss coverage under a policy may not extend for the full period of time that a tenant or tenants may be entitled to a rent abatement that is a result of, or that may be required to complete restoration following, a casualty event; 
 certain types of losses, such as those arising from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and terrorist attacks, and losses arising out of claims for exemplary or punitive damages, may be uninsurable or may not be economically feasible to insure; 
 changes in zoning, building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors may make it impossible or impracticable, to use insurance proceeds to replace damaged or destroyed improvements at a property; 
 insurance coverage is part of blanket insurance policies in which losses on properties in which we have no ownership interest could reduce significantly or eliminate the coverage available on our properties; and 
 the deductibles applicable to one or more buildings at a property may be greater than the losses sustained at such buildings. 
 If our insurance coverage is insufficient to cover losses sustained as a result of one or more casualty events, our operating results and the value of our portfolio will be adversely affected. 
 We may be adversely effected if we are unable to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with any one or more of our joint venture partners. 
 Two of our joint venture partners or their affiliates own an aggregate of six of the eight properties we own through unconsolidated joint ventures. This concentration of ownership of properties with a limited number of joint venture partners exposes us to risks of adverse developments, and in particular, disputes or disagreements with such joint venture partners, which are greater than the risks of owning properties with a more diverse group of joint venture partners. 
 
 Short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire. 
 
 Our multi-family leases are generally for a term of one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation as our leases allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases. However, since our leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected . 

Risks Related to Our Financing Activities, Indebtedness and Capital Resources 
 
 If we are unable to refinance 138.5 million in balloon payments on mortgage debt maturing through 2026, we may be forced to sell properties on disadvantageous terms. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, we have balloon payments of 138.5 million on mortgage debt (including 53.5 million of mortgage debt on properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures) due in 2025 and 2026 i.e., 15.3 million and 123.0 million due in 2025 and 2026, respectively). The weighted average interest rate of this debt is 4.85 . Our operating cash flow and funds available under our credit facility will be insufficient to discharge all of this debt when due. Accordingly, we will seek to refinance this debt or sell the related property prior to the maturity of such debt. Increases in interest rates, or reduced access to credit markets due, among other things, to more stringent lending requirements or our high level of leverage, may make it difficult for us to refinance this mortgage debt on terms as favorable as the current debt. If we are unsuccessful in refinancing such debt, or if the terms of the refinanced debt are less favorable than the current debt, we may be forced to 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms or convey properties secured by such mortgages to the mortgagees, which would reduce our income and impair the value of our portfolio. 
 Our acquisition, development and value-add activities are limited by the funds available to us. 
 Our ability to acquire additional multi-family properties, develop new properties and improve the properties in our portfolio is limited by the funds available to us (including funds available pursuant to our credit facility) and our ability to obtain, on acceptable terms, mortgage debt. At March 1, 2024, we had approximately 21.2 million of cash and cash equivalents (of which a significant portion is at the property level for day-to-day operating expenses) and up to 60 million available to us under our credit facility. Our multi-family acquisition and value-add activities are constrained by funds available to us which will limit growth in our revenues and operating results. 
 Our failure to comply with our obligations under our debt instruments may reduce our stockholders equity, and adversely affect our net income and ability to pay dividends. 
 
 Several of our debt instruments include covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including various coverage ratios, and comply with other requirements. Failure to meet interest and other payment obligations under our debt instruments or a breach by us of the covenants to comply with certain financial ratios would place us in non-compliance under such instruments. If the lender called a default and required us to repay the full amount outstanding under such instrument, we might be required to rapidly dispose of our properties, including properties securing such debt instruments, which could have an adverse impact on the amounts we receive on such disposition. From time to time we have failed to comply with certain debt covenants. If we are unable to satisfy the covenants of our debt obligations, the lender could exercise remedies available to it under the applicable debt instrument and as otherwise provided by law, including the possible appointment of a receiver to manage the property, application of deposits or reserves maintained under the debt instrument for payment of the debt, or foreclose and/or cause the forced sale of the property or asset securing such debt. A foreclosure or other forced disposition of our assets could result in the disposition of same at below the carrying value of such asset. The disposition of our properties or assets at below our carrying value may adversely affect our net income, reduce our stockholders equity and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. 
 
 We may not have sufficient funds to make required or desired capital improvements. 
 Our multi-family properties face competition from newer and updated properties. At December 31, 2023 the weighted average age (based on the number of units) of our multi-family properties is approximately 20 years. To remain competitive and increase occupancy at these properties and/or make them attractive to potential tenants or purchasers, we may have to make significant capital improvements and/or incur deferred maintenance costs with respect to these properties. The cost of future improvements and deferred maintenance is uncertain and the amounts earmarked for specific properties may be insufficient to effectuate needed improvements. Our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected if we are required to expend significant funds (other than funds earmarked for such purposes) to repair or improve our properties. 
 If we are required to make payments under any bad boy carve out guarantees that we have provided in connection with certain mortgages and related loans, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 
 In obtaining certain non-recourse loans, we have provided our lenders with standard carve out guarantees. These guarantees are only applicable if and when the borrower directly, or indirectly through an agreement with an affiliate, joint venture partner or other third party, voluntarily files a bankruptcy or similar liquidation or reorganization action or takes other actions that are fraudulent or improper (commonly referred to as bad boy guarantees). Although we believe that bad boy carve out guarantees are not guarantees of payment in the event of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond the borrower s control, some lenders in the real estate industry have recently sought to make claims for payment under such guarantees. In the event such a claim were made against us under a bad boy carve out guarantee, following foreclosure on mortgages or related loans, and such claim were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. 
 We could be negatively impacted by changes in our relationship with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, changes in the condition of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and by changes in government support for multi-family housing. 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been a major source of financing for multi-family real estate in the United States and we have used loan programs sponsored by these agencies to finance most of our acquisitions of multi-family properties. There have been ongoing discussion by the government and other interested parties with regard to the long term structure and viability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could result in adjustments to guidelines for their loan products. Should these agencies have their mandates changed or reduced, lose key personnel, be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity for the multi-family sector, our ability to obtain financing through loan programs sponsored by 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 the agencies could be negatively impacted. In addition, changes in our relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the lenders that participate in these loan programs, with respect to our existing mortgage financing could impact our ability to obtain comparable financing for new acquisitions or refinancing for our existing multi-family real estate investments. Should our access to financing provided through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan programs be reduced or impaired, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and could significantly limit our ability to acquire properties on acceptable terms and reduce the values to be realized upon property sales. 
 
 We depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow and will be adversely impacted if these subsidiaries are prohibited from distributing cash to us. 
 
 We conduct, and intend to conduct, substantially all of our business operations through our subsidiaries, including our unconsolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, our only source of cash to fund our operations and pay our obligations are distributions from our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to fund our operations. Each of our subsidiaries is or will be a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions( e.g. , restrictions imposed pursuant to mortgage debt on a property), limit our ability to obtain cash from such entities. In addition, because we operate through our subsidiaries, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all our and our subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. 
 Regulatory and Tax Risks 
 Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. 
 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations. 
 Liabilities relating to environmental matters may impact the value of our properties. 
 We may be subject to environmental liabilities arising from the ownership of properties. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. 
 The presence of hazardous substances on our properties may adversely affect our ability to finance or sell the property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. The discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Compliance or failure to comply with the ADA or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. 
 
 The ADA generally requires that public buildings, including the public areas at our properties, be made accessible to disabled persons. Non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or the award of damages to private litigants. From time-to-time claims may be asserted against us with respect to some of our properties under the ADA. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.

 Risks Associated with the Real Estate Industry and REITs. 
 
 We face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs. 
 
 As a real estate company, we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions, and any negative trends in such real estate conditions may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs. These conditions include: 
 changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, which may be negatively impacted by concerns about inflation, deflation, government deficits, unemployment rates and decreased consumer confidence particularly in markets in which we have a high concentration of properties; 
 increases in interest rates, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or to buy or sell properties on favorable terms or at all; 
 the inability of tenants to pay rent; 
 the existence and quality of the competition, such as the attractiveness of our properties as compared to our competitors' properties based on considerations such as convenience of location, rental rates, amenities and safety record; 
 increased operating costs, including increased real property taxes, maintenance, insurance and utility costs (including increased prices for fossil fuels); 
 weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses; 
 oversupply of apartments or single-family housing or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located; 
 a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of residents or potential residents of our multi-family properties deciding to purchase homes instead of renting; 
 changes in, or increased costs of compliance with, laws and/or governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; and 
 rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs. 
 
 Moreover, other factors may adversely affect our results of operations, including potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events, many of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors. Any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs. 
 Compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits. 
 We must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock, to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. We may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Accordingly, compliance with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must also ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of such issuer. In addition, no more than 5 of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer, other than a qualified REIT security. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we must dispose of the portion of our assets in excess of such amounts within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter in order to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. This requirement could cause us to dispose of assets for consideration of less than their true value and could lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

 Because real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio on a timely basis. 
 Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. Further, even if we are able to sell properties, we may be unable to reinvest the proceeds of such sales in opportunities that are as favorable as the properties sold. Our inability to reconfigure our portfolio to profitably reinvest the proceeds of property sales promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may incur impairment charges in 2024. 
 We evaluate on a quarterly basis our real estate portfolio for indicators of impairment. Impairment charges reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of the decline in the value of real estate assets we own. These charges and provisions may be required in the future as a result of factors beyond our control, including, among other things, changes in the economic environment and market conditions affecting the value of real property assets or natural or man-made disasters. 
 If we do not continue to pay cash dividends, the price of our common stock may decline . 
 REIT's are generally required to distribute annually at least 90 of their ordinary taxable income to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, which we refer to as the Code. Because we continue to generate operating losses primarily due to the impact of depreciation, we are not currently required, and may not be required in the future, to pay dividends to maintain our REIT status. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future. If we do not continue to pay cash dividends, the price of our common stock will decline. 
 Our business and operations are subject to physical and transition risks related to climate change. 
 
 Several of our multi-family properties are located along or near coastal areas that have historically been subject to the risk of extreme weather events. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, areas where many of our properties are located could experience more frequent and intense extreme weather events and rising sea levels, which may cause significant damage to our properties, disrupt our operations and adversely impact our residents. Over time, such conditions could result in reduced demand for housing in areas where our properties are located and increased costs related to further developing our properties to mitigate the effects of climate change or repairing damage related to the effects of climate change that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Likewise, such conditions also may negatively impact the types and pricing of insurance we are able to procure. 
 
 Changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations on climate change could result in increased operating costs and/or capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties without a corresponding increase in rental revenues. The imposition of such requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties (for example by requiring retrofits of existing multi-family properties to improve their energy efficiency and/or resistance to inclement weather) without creating corresponding increases in rental revenues, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results. 

Risks Related to BRT's Organization, Structure and Ownership of its Stock 
 Our transactions with affiliated entities involve conflicts of interest 
 
 Entities affiliated with us and with certain of our executive officers provide services to us and on our behalf. Among other things, we retain certain executive officers and others to provide the Services. The aggregate fees to be paid for the Services in 2024, and paid in 2023 and 2022, are 1.62 million, 1.54 million and 1.47 million, respectively. We obtain certain executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical personnel and the use of certain facilities pursuant to the shared services agreement. During 2023 and 2022, we reimbursed Gould Investors and , respectively, for the personnel and facilities provided pursuant to the shared services agreement. We also obtain certain insurance in conjunction with Gould Investors and reimbursed Gould Investors and , in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for our share of the insurance cost. These transactions may not be on terms as favorable as those that we would receive if the transactions were entered into with unaffiliated entities and persons. 
 
 Gould Investors from time-to time buys multi-family properties, including properties located in the Southeast United States. Although the properties purchased by Gould Investors are much smaller than the properties in which we are interested, a conflict of interest could arise should Gould Investors or we decide to pursue the acquisition of similar sized properties in such regions. See "Item 1 - Business - Our Acquisition Approach" 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business and our future success may depend on our ability to retain them. 
 We depend on the services of Jeffrey A. Gould, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies. Although Jeffrey A.Gould devotes substantially all of his business time to our affairs, he devotes a portion of his business time to entities affiliated with us. In addition to Jeffrey A. Gould, only three other executive officers, Mitchell Gould, our executive vice president, Ryan Baltimore, chief operating officer, and George Zweier, vice president and chief financial officer, devote all or substantially all of their business time to us. Many of our executives (i) also provide the Services (see " Item 1. Business-Human Capital Resources ") and (ii) provide their services on a part-time basis pursuant to the shared services agreement. We rely on part-time executive officers to provide certain services to us, including legal and certain accounting services, since we do not employ full-time executive officers to handle all of these services. If the shared services agreement is terminated or the executives performing Services are unwilling to continue to do so, we will have to obtain such services from other sources or hire employees to perform them. We may not be able to replace these services or hire such employees in a timely manner or on terms, including cost and level of expertise, that are equivalent to or better than those we receive pursuant to the Services and the shared services agreement. 
 In addition, in the future we may need to attract and retain qualified senior management and other key personnel, both on a full-time and part-time basis. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could impair our ability to carry out our business and our investment strategies. 
 We do not carry key man life insurance on members of our senior management. 
 Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Maryland law may inhibit a change in control that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of our common stock 
 
 Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (the "Charter"), our Bylaws and Maryland law may impede, or prevent, a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions: 
 provide for a staggered board of directors consisting of three classes, with one class of directors being elected each year and each class being elected for three-year terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; 
 impose restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock (such provisions being intended to, among other purposes, facilitate our compliance with certain requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), relating to our qualification as a REIT under the Code); 
 prevent our stockholders from amending the Bylaws; 
 limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; 
 establish advance notice and informational requirements and time limitations on any director nomination or proposal that a stockholder wishes to make at a meeting of stockholders; 
 provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only by the vote of at least two-thirds of all votes generally entitled to be cast in the election of directors; 
 do not permit cumulative voting in the election of our board of directors, which would otherwise permit holders of less than a majority of outstanding shares to elect one or more directors; and 
 authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the Charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL may impede a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or inhibit a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could be in the best interest of holders of shares of our common stock, including: 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 business combination provisions that, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of BRT who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock) or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; 
 control share provisions that provide that, subject to certain exceptions, holders of control shares of BRT (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the holder to exercise voting power in the election of directors within one of three increasing ranges) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions) have no voting rights with respect to the control shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares; and 
 additionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in the Charter or the Bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions. 
 We have (1) exempted all business combinations between us and any other person, provided that each such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such other person), from the Maryland Business Combination Act and (2) opted out of the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act. 
 
 Ownership of less than 6.0 of our outstanding shares or less than 6.0 of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock could violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer in our Charter, which would result in the transfer of the shares owned or acquired in violation of such restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and loss of the right to receive dividends and other distributions on, and the economic benefit of any appreciation of, such shares, and you may not have sufficient information to determine at any particular time whether an acquisition of our shares will result in the loss of the economic benefit of such shares. 
 
 In order for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code, no more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock may be owned, directly or indirectly or through application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) at any time during the last half of a taxable year. To facilitate our qualification as a REIT under the Code, among other purposes, the Charter generally prohibits any person from actually or constructively owning more than 6.0 , in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding shares of common stock, or more than 6.0 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, which we refer to as the ownership limits, unless our board of directors exempts the person from such ownership limit. In addition, the Charter prohibits any person from beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that would result in more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of our stock to be beneficially owned by five or fewer individuals, regardless of whether such ownership is during the last half of any taxable year, which we refer to as the Five or Fewer Limit. Shares owned or acquired in violation of either of these restrictions will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary selected by us. The person that owned or acquired our stock in violation of the restrictions in the Charter will not be entitled to any dividends or distributions paid after the date of the transfer to the trust and, upon a sale of such shares by the trust, will generally be entitled to receive only the lesser of the market value on the date of the event that resulted in the transfer to the trust or the net proceeds of the sale by the trust to a person who could own the shares without violating the ownership limits. 
 
 Our board of directors has exempted Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould from the ownership limits and has not established a limitation on ownership for such persons. Based on information supplied to us, as of December 31, 2023, Gould Investors owns approximately 19.1 of the outstanding shares of common stock and, by virtue of the applicable attribution rules under the Code, these individuals beneficially own approximately 23.3 of outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, the acquisition by each of four other individuals of 6.0 of our outstanding common stock, when combined with the ownership of our common stock of Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould, generally would not result in a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit. However, there is no limitation on Gould Investors,

Table of Contents 

 Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould or Jeffrey A. Gould acquiring additional shares of our common stock or otherwise increasing their percentage of ownership of our common stock, meaning that the amount of our stock that other persons or entities may acquire without violating the Five or Fewer Limit could be reduced in the future and without notice. To the extent that Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould, or their affiliates, acquire additional shares or our stock, or any other event occurs (including a repurchase of shares of our stock), that results in an individual beneficially or constructively owning 26.0 or more of the outstanding shares of our stock within the meaning of the Charter, the acquisition by four other individuals of 6.0 or less of our outstanding stock would violate the Five or Fewer Limit and, therefore, could cause the stock acquired by one or more of these other individuals to be transferred to the charitable trust, despite their compliance with the 6.0 ownership limits. If any of the foregoing occurs, compliance with the 6.0 ownership limit will not ensure that your ownership of our stock does not cause a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit or that your shares of our stock are not transferred to the charitable trust. 
 
 Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould and Jeffrey A. Gould will be required by the Exchange Act and regulations promulgated thereunder to report, with certain exceptions, their acquisition of additional shares of our stock within two days of such acquisitions, and all holders of our stock will be required to file reports of their acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act) of more than 5 of our outstanding stock. However, beneficial ownership for purposes of the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act is calculated differently than beneficial ownership for purposes of determining compliance with the Five or Fewer Limit. Further, to the extent that any one or more of Gould Investors, Fredric H. Gould, Matthew J. Gould or Jeffrey A. Gould acquires 30 or more of our outstanding stock, ownership of five percent or less of our outstanding stock could still result in a violation of the Five or Fewer Limit and, therefore, cause newly-acquired stock in our company to be transferred to the charitable trust. As a result, you may not have enough information currently available to you at any time to determine the percentage of ownership of our stock that you can acquire without violating the Five or Fewer Limit and losing the economic benefit of the ownership of such newly-acquired shares. 
 
 The stock market is volatile, and fluctuations in our operating results, removal from various indices and other factors could cause our stock price to decline. 
 
 The stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies. Market fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as pandemics, recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, or trade wars, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, our operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. 
 
 Although our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically, as a result of which stockholders might not have been able to sell or purchase our common stock at the volume, price or time desired. In June 2018, our common stock was added to the Russell 3000 Index. If our common stock is removed from the Russell 3000 Index because it does not meet the criteria for continued inclusion in such index, index funds, institutional investors, or other holders attempting to track the composition of that index may be required to sell our common stock, which would adversely impact the price and frequency at which it trades. 

General Business Risks 
 
 Breaches of information technology systems could materially harm our business and reputation. 
 
 We, our joint venture partners and the property managers managing our properties, collect and retain, through information technology systems, financial, personal and other sensitive information provided by third parties, including tenants, vendors and employees. Such persons also rely on information technology systems for the collection and distribution of funds. Our information technology systems have been breached though, to our knowledge, none of our properties nor tenants have suffered any material damages therefrom. There can be no assurance that we, our joint venture partners or property managers will be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or the unauthorized distribution of funds. Any loss of this information or unauthorized distribution of funds as a result of a breach of information technology systems may result in loss of funds to which we are entitled, legal liability and costs (including damages and penalties), as well as damage to our reputation, that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.

 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Our information technology, communication networks, enterprise applications, accounting and financial reporting platforms and related systems are integral to our operations. We use these systems, among others, for internal communications, for accounting and record-keeping functions, and for many other key aspects of our business. Our operations rely on securing, collecting, storing, transmitting, and processing of proprietary and confidential data. 
 We have deployed various safeguards designed to protect our information technology IT systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls. At the management level, these cybersecurity defense systems are overseen by our network administrator who performs services for us on a part-time basis pursuant to the shared services agreement. Our network administrator has more than 20 years of experience with IT systems and holds various IT certifications. Our network administrator reports to, and is in regular contact with, our Senior Vice President-Finance and Senior Vice President. These officers do not have formal IT or cybersecurity training. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, among other things, the network administrator and these officers would consult with one another and, as needed or appropriate, other members of management to determine the appropriate course of action (including whether such incident should be reported to other members of management and/or the audit committee and whether public disclosure should, or is, required to be made). 
 
 Our internal auditor perform certain procedures to test the integrity and functionality of our IT systems (which includes a high-level review of our cybersecurity defenses). In addition, we have retained a third-party cybersecurity consulting firm that (i) advises us as to cybersecurity matters (including prevailing cybersecurity threats), (ii) performs, on a periodic basis, assessments of our cybersecurity defenses and (iii) on a continuous basis, monitors our IT systems for cybersecurity threats and intrusions. 
 
 We are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report for additional discussion about cybersecurity-related risks. 
 
 To operate our business, we use certain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions. We seek to engage reliable, reputable service providers that maintain cybersecurity programs and we generally rely on such providers to maintain appropriate cybersecurity practices. 
 
 At the Board level, our cybersecurity practices are overseen by the audit committee as part of its oversight of our risk management activities. The committee meets periodically with , among others, our internal auditor and network administrator to review and discuss cybersecurity matters. 
 
 Item 2. Properties. 
 Our principal executive office is located at 60 Cutter Mill Road, Suite 303, Great Neck, NY. We believe that this facility is satisfactory for our current and projected needs. 
 See "Item 1 Business" for additional information regarding our properties. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 As previously reported, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that owns a property in Houston, TX was named as a defendant, along with multiple other defendants, in a wrongful death action entitled Takakura et al. v. Houston Pizza Venture, LP, and Papa John s USA., Inc. et.al., 129th Judicial District, Harris County, TX, Cause No. 2019-42425 (the "Takakura Lawsuit"). The lawsuit has been settled, all claims against us were released and our share of the settlement costs were covered by our insurance policy. 
 From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, and in particular, personal injury claims involving the operations of our properties. Although we believe that the primary and umbrella insurance coverage maintained with respect to our properties is sufficient to cover claims for compensatory damages, many of these personal injury claims also assert exemplary( i.e; punitive) damages. Generally, insurance does not cover claims for exemplary damages and we may be adversely affected if claims for exemplary damages are asserted successfully.

 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Overview 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that owns, operates and to a lesser extent holds interest in joint ventures that own and operate multi family properties. At December 31, 2023, we: (i) wholly-own 21 multi-family properties with an aggregate of 5,420 units and a carrying value of 634.0 million, (ii) have ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in seven multi-family properties with an aggregate of 2,287 units, with a carrying value of 30.4 million and (iii) own other assets, through consolidated and unconsolidated entities, with a carrying value of 5.6 million. The 28 multi-family properties are located in 11 states; primarily in the Southeast United States and Texas. 
 During 2023: 
 The unconsolidated joint venture that owned Chatham Court and Reflections, a 494 unit multi-family property located in Dallas, TX, and in which we had a 50 interest, sold such property. Our share of the (i) gain from this sale was 14.7 million, (ii) the related early extinguishment of debt charge was 212,000, and (iii) proceeds from the sale were 19.4 million. In 2023 and 2022, this property accounted for 54,000 and 753,000, respectively, of equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 We paid off our credit facility debt of 19.0 million - we accomplished this by using the proceeds of new mortgage debt of 21.2 million placed on our Silvana Oaks - North Charleston, SC multi-family property; such mortgage debt matures in March 2033, bears an interest rate of 4.45 and is interest only for the term of the mortgage. 
 
 We repurchased 779,423 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 14.4 million i.e ., an average price per share of 18.47). 
 Entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to our amended and restated credit facility (the "Facility") with VNB New York, LLC, an affiliate of Valley National Bank VNB ), which converted the Facility's interest rate to one-month term SOFR plus 250 basis points, and increased the interest rate floor to 6 . Immediately prior to the amendment, the interest rate on the facility was 8.5 ; immediately thereafter, the interest rate was 7.82 
 From January 1, 2024 through March 1, 2024, we purchased 123,061 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2.3 million i.e., an average price of 18.43per share). 
 
 Challenges and Uncertainties as a Result of the Volatile Economic Environment; Impact of Development Property 
 
 During the past two years, there has been a significant economic uncertainty due, among other things, to volatile interest rates and the challenges presented by an inflationary/potential recessionary environment. Due to this uncertainty and our belief that pricing for acquisition opportunities did not appropriately reflect market conditions, we were especially cautious in pursuing acquisition opportunities in 2023 and may continue to be cautious in pursuing such opportunities in the near future. Further, the competitive environment in several of our markets as well as anticipated expense increases create uncertainty as to our ability to improve income from continuing operations. 
 
 We have a 17.45 interest in a 240-unit development property located in Johns Island, SC. As of December 31, 2023, this project is substantially complete and lease-up has begun. We estimate that for 2024, we will record approximately 350,000 to 500,000 of equity in loss from unconsolidated ventures related to this property because the venture will begin recognizing revenue and expenses (and in particular depreciation and interest which had been capitalized during the development phase).

 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 
 The term "same store properties" refers to ten multi-family properties with an aggregate of 2,576 units that were owned for all of 2023 and 2022. The term "unconsolidated same store properties" with an aggregate of 2,287 units refers to seven properties that were owned for all of 2023 and 2022. As used in the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the term "Partner Buyouts" refers to our purchase in 2022 of the interests of our joint venture partners at 11 properties. 
 Revenues 
 The following table compares our revenues for the years indicated: 
 (Dollars in thousands): 2023 2022 Change Change Rental and other revenue from real estate properties 22,554 32.0 Other income 536 N/M Total revenues 23,090 32.7 
 
 Rental and other revenue from real estate properties. The components of the increase include: 
 20.8 million from the Partner Buyouts; and 
 2.6 million from same store properties, substantially all of which is due to higher average rental rates. 
 Offsetting the increase is a 1.0 million decrease due to a decline in occupancy from 96.4 to 93.6 at same store properties, including 343,000 at Bells Bluff-West Nashville, TN, which experienced a decline in occupancy due to increased supply in the market and change in demand for certain unit types. 
 Other Income 
 The increase is due primarily to increased earnings on our cash balances due to higher interest rates. 
 Expenses 
 
 The following table compares our expenses for the periods indicated: (Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Change Real estate operating expenses 11,263 36.9 Interest expense 6,647 42.8 General and administrative 779 5.3 Depreciation and amortization 3,672 14.8 Total expenses 22,361 26.1 
 Real estate operating expenses. The components of the increase include: 
 9.4 million from the Partner Buyouts; and 
 1.8 million from same store properties, including: 
 
 880,000 due to the master insurance program implemented in December 2022 and increases in insurance costs overall.; 
 295,000 in real estate taxes due to increases primarily at four properties; and 
 general cost increases, including 228,000 in property level payroll costs, 201,000 in utilities costs and 211,000 across other expense categories.

Table of Contents 

 Interest expense 
 The components of the increase include: 
 5.2 million due to the Partner Buyouts; 
 1.3 million due to the increase in the interest rate on our floating rate junior subordinated notes; and 
 372,000 of interest expense on the Silvana Oaks mortgage which was obtained in February 2023. 
 
 The increase was offset by a 139,000 decrease in interest expense on our credit facility primarily due to the payoff of the facility in February 2023 in connection with the receipt of proceeds from the Silvana Oaks mortgage. 
 
 General and administrative. 
 
 The components of the increase include: 
 
 379,000 due to the amortization expense related to the restricted stock granted in January 2023 (as a result of the higher fair value of the shares granted in 2023 in comparison to the restricted stock granted in 2018); and 
 232,000 of cash compensation and related payroll expense due to higher levels of compensation and increased employee headcount. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 The increase is due 5.8 million from the Partner Buyouts, offset by a 2.1 million decrease due to reduced depreciation related to lease intangibles resulting from such buyouts. 
 
 Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures and equity in earnings from sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties . 
 
 Please see a detailed explanation of these categories in the next section entitled "Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Results of Operations".

 Insurance recovery of casualty loss 
 
 During 2023, we received insurance proceeds of (i) 323,000 in connection with the settlement of the Takakura Lawsuit and (ii) 470,000 as reimbursement for expenses incurred related to a winter storm in December 2022. During 2022, we received 850,000 in insurance proceeds upon the settlement of a personal injury lawsuit. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate

Same store properties at Unconsolidated Properties represent seven properties that were owned for the entirety of the periods being compared. 
 Rental revenue from unconsolidated joint ventures 
 The decrease is due to: 
 18.4 million from the Partner Buyouts; 
 7.5 million primarily from the sale, in 2022, of Verandas at Shavano-San Antonio, TX, Cinco Ranch-Katy, TX, Vive at Kellswater-Kannapolis, NC and Water's Edge-Columbia, SC (collectively, the "2022 Sales"); and 
 4.4 million from the Chatham Sale.

 Funds from Operations; Adjusted Funds from Operations; Net Operating Income. 
 In view of our multi-family property activities, we disclose funds from operations ("FFO") ,adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO") and net operating income ("NOI") because we believe that such metrics are a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of a multi-family REIT. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the "White Paper on Funds From Operations" issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and NAREIT's related guidance. FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. In computing FFO, we do not add back to net income the amortization of costs in connection with our financing activities or depreciation of non-real estate assets. 
 
 We compute AFFO by adjusting FFO for loss on extinguishment of debt, our straight-line rent accruals, restricted stock and RSU compensation expense, fair value adjustment of mortgage debt, gain on insurance recovery, insurance recovery from casualty loss and deferred mortgage and debt costs (including, in each case as applicable, from our share from our unconsolidated joint ventures). Since the NAREIT White Paper does not provide guidelines for computing AFFO, the computation of AFFO may vary from one REIT to another. 
 We believe that FFO and AFFO are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assures that the value of real estate assets diminish predictability over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, we believe that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. We also consider FFO and AFFO to be useful to us in evaluating potential property acquisitions. 
 FFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance; nor should FFO and AFFO be considered an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity. 
 FFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization and capital improvements. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP. 
 Management recognizes that there are limitations in the use of FFO and AFFO. In evaluating our performance, management is careful to examine GAAP measures such as net income (loss) and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Management also reviews the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO and AFFO.

 1.2 million increase in interest expense (including 465,000 of amortization of mortgage fair value costs); 
 499,000 increase in general and administrative expense (excluding non cash-amortization of restricted stock 
 and RSU expense); and 
 402,000 decrease in gains from insurance proceeds.

NOI is a non-GAAP measure of performance. NOI is used by our management and many investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends at our properties and to determine the estimated fair value of our properties. The usefulness of NOI may be limited in that it does not take into account, among other things, general and administrative expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, casualty losses, insurance recoveries and gains or losses as determined by GAAP. NOI is a property specific performance metric and does not measure our performance as a whole. Same store NOI reflects the operations of seven of our ten wholly-owned properties. 
 
 We compute NOI by adjusting net income (loss) to (a) add back (1) interest expense, (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) depreciation expense, (4) impairment charges, (5) provision for taxes, (6) loss on extinguishment of debt, (7) equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures, (8) casualty loss and (9) the impact of non-controlling interests, and (b) deduct (1) other income, (2) gain on sale of real estate (3) gain on sale of partnership interest, (4) equity in earnings from sale of consolidated joint venture properties, (5) insurance recovery of casualty loss and (6) gain on insurance recoveries. Other REIT s may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REIT s. We believe NOI provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income (loss). NOI is one of the measures we use to evaluate our performance because it (i) measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items unrelated to property operating performance and (ii) captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance.

 In 2023, NOI increased by 11.3 million from 2022 primarily due to a 20.8 million increase in rental revenues resulting from the Partner Buyouts. The increase was offset by a 9.4 million increase, primarily due to the Partner Buyouts, in real estate operating expenses. Same store NOI remained flat in 2023 from 2022 due to a 1.8 million increase in rental revenues (and in particular, the increase in average rental rates) offset by a 1.8 million increase in real estate operating expenses. See "-Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022" for a discussion of these changes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We require funds to pay operating expenses and debt service obligations, acquire properties, make capital and other improvements, fund capital contributions, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Generally, in 2023, our primary sources of capital and liquidity were the operations of our multi-family properties (including distributions of 6.3 million from the operations of our unconsolidated joint ventures), our 19.4 million share of the net proceeds from the Chatham Sale, and our available cash. Excluding funds held at our unconsolidated subsidiaries, at December 31, 2023 and March 1, 2024, our available liquidity was approximately 83.5 million and 81.2 million, respectively, including 23.5 million and 21.2 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and subject to compliance with borrowing base and other requirements, up to 60 million and 60 million, respectively, available under our credit facility. A significant amount of our cash and cash equivalents is maintained at our properties for general working capital purposes. 
 
 We anticipate that for the four years beginning January 1, 2024, our operating expenses, 127.8 million of mortgage amortization and interest expense (including 50.4 million from unconsolidated joint ventures) and 204.4 million of balloon payments due with respect to mortgages maturing through 2027 (including 76.7 million from unconsolidated joint ventures), anticipated capital expenditures (for 2024 only) of 10.1 million for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties (including an estimated 2.7 million for our value add program), estimated cash dividend payments of at least 74.0 million (assuming (i) the current quarterly dividend rate of 0.25 per share and (ii) 18.5 million shares outstanding) will be funded from cash generated from operations (including distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures), mortgage financings and re-financings, sales of properties, the issuance of additional equity and, if available, our 60 million credit facility. Our operating cash flow and available cash is insufficient to fully fund the 204.4 million of balloon payments, and if we are unable to refinance such debt on acceptable terms, we may need to issue additional equity or dispose of properties, in each case on potentially unfavorable terms. 
 
 Our ability to acquire multi-family properties and implement value-add projects is limited by our available cash and our ability to (i) draw on our credit facility, (ii) obtain, on acceptable terms, mortgage debt and (iii) raise capital from the sale of our common stock. Further, if and to the extent we generate ordinary taxable income, we will be required to make distributions to stockholders to maintain our REIT status and as a result, will be limited in our ability to use gains, if any, from property sales, as a source of funds for operating expenses, debt service and property acquisitions.

Corporate Level Financing Arrangements 
 
 Junior Subordinated Notes 
 As of December 31, 2023, 37.4 million (excluding deferred costs of 257,000) in principal amount of our junior subordinated notes is outstanding. These notes mature in April 2036, contain limited covenants (including covenants prohibiting us from paying dividends or repurchasing capital stock if there is an event of default (as defined therein) on these notes), are redeemable at our option and bear an interest rate, which resets and is payable quarterly, of three-month term SOFR plus 226 basis points. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the interest rate on these notes was 7.65 and 6.41 , respectively. 
 Credit Facility 
 Our credit facility with VNB New York, LLC, an affiliate of Valley National Bank (collectively, "VNB"), allows us to borrow, subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements and other conditions, up to 60 million, (i) for the acquisition of, and investment in, multi-family properties, (ii) to repay mortgage debt secured by multi-family properties and (iii) for Operating Expenses i.e. , working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses); provided, that not more than 25 million may be used for Operating Expenses. The credit facility is secured by cash accounts maintained by us at VNB (and we are required to maintain substantially all of our bank accounts at VNB), and the pledge of our interests in the entities that own three unencumbered multi-family properties used in calculating the borrowing base. The credit facility bears an annual interest rate, which resets monthly, equal to one-month term SOFR plus 250 basis points, with a floor of 6.00 . The interest rate at December 31, 2023 and March 1, 2024, was 7.85 and 7.82 respectively. There is an annual fee of 0.25 on the total amount committed by VNB and unused by us. The credit facility matures in September 2025. As of March 1, 2024, there was no balance outstanding and up to 60 million was available to be borrowed thereunder. 
 The terms of the credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of liens, require that we maintain and include in the collateral securing the facility at least three unencumbered properties with an aggregate value(as calculated pursuant to the facility) of at least 75 million, and require compliance with financial ratios relating to, among other things maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of 140 million, the minimum amount of debt service coverage with respect to the properties (and amounts drawn on the credit facility) used in calculating the borrowing base. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of wholly-owned properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the facility. 

Other Financing Sources and Arrangements 
 
 At December 31, 2023, we are joint venture partners in unconsolidated joint ventures which own seven multi-family properties which distributed 5.2 million to us in 2023. We may be required to make capital contributions with respect to these properties. At December 31, 2023, our investment in these joint venture properties have a net equity carrying value of 30.4 million and are subject to mortgage debt, which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, of 247.0 million. Although BRT Apartments Corp. is not the obligor with respect to such mortgage debt, the loss of any of these properties due to mortgage foreclosure or similar proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 See Item 1. " Business-Mortgage Debt " for information regarding our mortgage debt at consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Table of Contents 

 Inflation 
 Substantially all of our multi-family property leases are for periods of one-year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation on our revenue. During 2023, we experienced inflationary pressures that drove higher operating expenses, primarily in personnel, repairs and maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; such increases may continue in 2024 and thereafter, which would adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 Inflation affects the overall cost of our debt. We mitigate the risks presented by inflation through the use of long-term fixed interest rate debt and interest rate hedges and by paying down, when we deem appropriate, our credit facility debt. However, increasing interest rates, which generally correlates to increasing inflation, increases the interest expense on our junior subordinated notes and may make it less attractive to obtain mortgage debt or use our credit facility in connection with acquisition, refinancing and value add activities. 
 
 Cash Distribution Policy 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, we must, among other things, meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute currently at least 90 of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders. It is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal, state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently (in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations) to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal, state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify for federal taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income i.e. , taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations thereunder) and are subject to Federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. 
 
 It is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code no less than 90 , and, if possible, 100 of our annual taxable income, including taxable gains from the sale of real estate. It will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
 We anticipate that if we do not sell any multi-family properties this year, that a significant amount of the dividends we will pay in 2024 will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a return of capital. 
 
 Our board of directors will continue to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the amount of dividend payments based on its assessment of, among other things, our short and long-term cash and liquidity requirements, prospects, debt maturities, net income, funds from operations, and adjusted funds from operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. 
 
 We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements in this report. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 Equity method investments 
 We report our investments in unconsolidated entities, over whose operating and financial policies we do not control, under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, our pro rata share of the applicable entity's earnings or losses is included in our consolidated statements of operations. We initially record our investments based on either the carrying value for properties contributed or the cash invested. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 We evaluate our equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investments may exceed the fair value. If it is determined that a decline in the fair value of our investments is not temporary, and if such reduced fair value is below its carrying value, an impairment is recorded. Determining fair value involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider available evidence including the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and other relevant factors. 
 Carrying Value of Real Estate Portfolio 
 We conduct a quarterly review of each real estate asset owned by us and through our joint ventures. This review is conducted in order to determine if indicators of impairment are present on the real estate. 
 In reviewing the value of the real estate assets owned, if there is an indicator of impairment and the carrying value of the real estate asset is determined to be unrecoverable, we seek to arrive at the fair value of each real estate asset by using one or more valuation techniques, such as comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis or replacement cost analysis. A real estate asset is considered to be unrecoverable when an analysis suggests that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property will be insufficient to recover our investment. Any impairment taken with respect to our real estate assets reduces our net income, assets and stockholders' equity to the extent of the amount of the allowance, but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold. 
 Purchase Price Allocations 
 We allocate the purchase price of properties, including acquisition costs and assumed debt, when appropriate, to the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we use a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired. 
 Equity-Based Compensation 
 We grant shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to eligible plan participants, subject to the recipient's continued service over a specified period and, with respect to the RSUs, the satisfaction of specified conditions over a specified period. A portion of the RSUs vest based upon satisfaction of specified metrics with respect to (i) total stockholder return( TSR Awards and (ii) adjusted funds from operations( AFFO Awards ), in each case as calculated pursuant to the applicable award agreement. We account for the restricted stock awards and RSUs in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires that such compensation be recognized in the financial statements based on its estimated grant-date fair value. The value of such awards is recognized as compensation expense in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the applicable service periods. Grant date fair value is determined with respect to the (i) the restricted stock awards, by the closing stock price on the date of grant, (ii) TSR Awards, by using a Monte Carlo simulation relying upon various assumptions and (iii) AFFO Awards, by using the closing stock price on the grant date, subject to quarterly adjustment based upon management s projection as to the achievability of the specified metrics related to the AFFO Awards. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 All of our mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates. Our credit facility bears interest at 30 day term SOFR plus 250 basis points, with an interest rate floor of 6 . At December 31, 2023, no amounts were drawn on the facility. Our junior subordinated notes bear interest at the rate of three-month term SOFR plus 226 basis points. At December 31, 2023, the interest rate on these notes was 7.65 . A 100 basis point increase in the rate would result in an increase in interest expense in 2023 of 374,000 (all of which would be due to the change in rate on the junior subordinated notes) and a 100 basis point decrease in the rate would result in a 374,000 decrease (all of which would be due to the change in rate on the junior subordinated notes) in interest expense in 2023.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 A review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented as of December 31, 2023, were effective. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company's board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of a company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of a company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board of directors of a company; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial transactions. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). 
 
 Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of BRT Apartments Corp. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BRT Apartments Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of Investments in Real Estate 
 Description of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Company s investments in real estate totaled approximately 636 million. As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews its investments in real estate when events or circumstances change indicating the carry value of the investment may not be recoverable. 
 Auditing the Company s impairment analysis involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the judgment used by management to determine when indicators of impairment exist. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit For investments in real estate, we obtained and reviewed management s analysis of whether any indicators of impairment were identified, evaluated whether the list of indicators of impairment was complete, and evaluated whether conclusions reached by management were reasonable based on property-specific factors.

BRT APARTMENTS CORP. CLAWBACK POLICY Effective as of October 2, 2023 The Board of Directors (the Board of BRT Apartments Corp. (the Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt this Clawback Policy (the Policy which provides for the recovery of certain incentive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as defined below). This Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act Rule 10-D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 and Section 303a.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the Listing Standard ). 1. Administration Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, a committee thereof (the Board or such committee charged with administration of this Policy, the Administrator ). The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate of advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by the policy. In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board, as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee s responsibility and authority. Subject to applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee). 2. Definitions As used in this Policy, the following definitions shall apply: Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. Administrator has the meaning set forth in Section 1 hereof. Exhibit 97.1 

2 Applicable Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, as well as any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). The date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement is the earlier to occur of (a) the date the Determining Body (as defined below) concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (b) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement, in each case regardless of if or when the restated financial statements are filed. Covered Executives means the Company s current and former executive officers, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the definition of executive officer set forth in Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards. Determining Body means the body that has authority to conclude that an Accounting Restatement is required (i.e., the Board or a committee thereof), or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required. Erroneously Awarded Compensation has the meaning set forth in Section 5 of this Policy. A Financial Reporting Measure is any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, any measure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure, the Company s stock price and total stockholder return. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. Incentive-Based Compensation is received for purposes of this Policy in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 3. Covered Executives; Incentive-Based Compensation 

3 This Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Executive (a) after beginning services as a Covered Executive; (b) if that person served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive- Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national securities exchange. 4. Required Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the Event of an Accounting Restatement In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall promptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by any Covered Executive, as calculated pursuant to Section 5 hereof, during the Applicable Period. 5. Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery The amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation subject to recovery under the Policy, as determined by the Administrator, is the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been received by the Covered Executive had it been determined based on the restated amounts. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR: (a) the Administrator shall determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ). Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed by the Administrator without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 6. Method of Recoupment The Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include without limitation (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity- based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or investor or paid or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Executive, including amounts 

4 payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Covered Executive. The Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Administrator has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural and disclosure requirements: The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Administrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to NYSE; or Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 7. No Indemnification of Covered Executives Notwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Covered Executive that may be interpreted to the contrary, the Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy. 8. Administrator Indemnification Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy. 

5 9. Effective Date; Retroactive Application This Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ). The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by Covered Executives on or after the Effective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date. Without limiting the generality of Section 6 hereof, and subject to applicable law, the Administrator may affect recovery under this Policy from any amount of compensation approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Executive prior to, on or after the Effective Date. 10. Amendment; Termination The Board may amend, modify, supplement, rescind or replace all or any portion of this Policy at any time and from time to time in its discretion, and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company s securities are listed. 11. Other Recoupment Rights; Company Claims The Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. Nothing contained in this Policy, and no recoupment or recovery as contemplated by this Policy, shall limit any claims, damages or other legal remedies the Company or any of its affiliates may have against a Covered Executive arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by the Covered Executive. 12. Successors This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
