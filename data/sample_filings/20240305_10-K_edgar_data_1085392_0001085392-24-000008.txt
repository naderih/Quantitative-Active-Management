 Employee workforce factors including strikes; work stoppages; retirements; absences due to pandemics, accidents, natural disasters or other significant, unforeseeable events; availability of qualified employees or the loss of a key executive; PSE's ability to attract, retain, and compensate employees while operating within a region of high demand for skilled workers resulting in significant competition and wage pressure; 
 The ability to obtain insurance coverage, the availability of insurance for certain specific losses, including those arising from catastrophic events such as wildfires and the cost of such insurance; 
 Changes in Puget Energy's or PSE's credit ratings, which may have an adverse impact on the availability and cost of capital for Puget Energy or PSE generally and the ability to pay dividends; 
 Deteriorating values of the equity, fixed income and other markets which could significantly impact the value of investments of PSE's retirement plan, post-retirement medical benefit plan trusts and the funding of obligations thereunder; and Recent laws proposed or passed by various municipalities in PSE's service territory, including Seattle, which seek to reduce or eliminate the use of natural gas in various contexts, such as for space heating, cooking, and water heating in new commercial and multifamily buildings, which in turn may impact operations due to costs and delays from incremental permitting and other requirements that are outside PSE's control. 

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and, except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 
 Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999. Substantially all of its operations are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE), a utility company. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned, non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which was formed in 2016 and has the sole purpose of owning and operating the non-regulated activity of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Port of Tacoma, Washington. 
 Puget Energy is owned through a holding company structure by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings). All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings. Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCIMC), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS), PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V., Macquarie Washington Clean Energy Investment, L.P., and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company. 
 
 Corporate Strategy 
 Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE, and be the clean energy provider of choice for its customers. 
 
 Customers and Revenue Overview 
 PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960. PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region. 
 The following table presents the number of PSE customers for electric and natural gas as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:

 1,230 1,217 1.1 877 872 0.6 
 _______________ 
 1 At December 31, 2023, and 2022, approximately 425,996 and 423,382 customers purchased both electricity and natural gas from PSE, respectively. 
 
 PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage and affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses. While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions. PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and corresponding higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and lower sales and corresponding lower power costs in the third quarter of the year. While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and 
 7 

natural gas operating revenues to recognize fixed revenue per customer from residential, commercial and industrial customers for the recovery of electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs. For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

 General Rate Case Filing 
 PSE filed a GRC which includes a two year multiyear rate plan (MYRP) with the Washington Commission on February 15, 2024, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 6.7 and 19.0 respectively in rate year one (expected to approximate calendar year 2025) and 8.5 and 2.1 , respectively in rate year two (expected to approximate calendar year 2026). PSE requested a return on equity of 9.95 for the first rate year beginning in 2025 and 10.5 for the second rate year beginning in 2026. PSE requested an overall rate of return of 7.65 in rate year one and 7.99 in rate year two. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2024 as required by RCW 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2026, the final year of the MYRP. The next phase of the filing will be to establish a procedural calendar for the adjudication of the case. The Company estimates the agreed upon rates from this proceeding will become effective by statute approximately 11 months after filings. 
 On December 22, 2022, the Washington Commission issued an order on PSE s 2022 GRC, which was filed on January 31, 2022, that approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.16 , or 6.62 after-tax, a capital structure of 49.0 in common equity in 2023 and 2024, and a return on equity of 9.4 . On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s natural gas rates in its compliance filing with an overall net revenue change of 70.8 million or 6.4 in 2023 and 19.5 million or 1.7 in 2024, with an effective date of January 7, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s electric rates in its compliance filing with an overall net revenue change of 247.0 million or 10.8 in 2023 and 33.1 million or 1.3 in 2024 with an effective date of January 11, 2023. Per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UE-220066, rates approved in PSE's power cost only rate case (PCORC) in Docket No. UE-200980 were set to zero as of January 11, 2023, and PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the period covered by the two-year rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. 
 Prior rates were subject to the 2019 GRC and included a weighted cost of capital of 7.39 or 6.8 after-tax, a capital structure of 48.5 in common equity, and a return on equity of 9.4 . The annualized overall rate impacts were an electric revenue increase of 48.3 million, or 2.3 , and a natural gas increase of 4.9 million, or 0.6 , effective October 1, 2021. For further information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Power Cost Only Rate Case 
 A PCORC is a limited scope proceeding to reset power cost rates. In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service. To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission is not required to but historically has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC. In the 2022 GRC settlement, PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the two-year rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. As noted earlier, per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UE-220066, rates set in PSE's last PCORC were set to zero as of January 11, 2023. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses monthly, PSE's decoupling mechanism, Schedule 142, help mitigate the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues to recognize fixed revenue per customer from residential, commercial and industrial customers for the recovery of electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a fixed, per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels. PSE's energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism. The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms is not affected by consumption; however delivery revenue is affected by customer growth, while fixed production costs are held at the level of cost from the most recent rate

proceeding and are not impacted by customer growth. Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period. For further details regarding decoupling filings, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Electric Rate Filings

 The Schedule 129D rider tariff implements surcharges to collect the costs incurred by the Company in providing the rate discounts specified in Schedule 7BDR, including administrative costs approved in Docket No. UE-230692. 
 
 Clean Energy Implementation Tracker 
 The Schedule 141CEI tariff implements surcharges to collect the costs incurred and associated with the Company s clean energy implementation plan (CEIP). This schedule will recover the costs associated with the Company s approved CEIP in Docket No. UE-210795 that are not recovered in the other tariff schedules. In the 2022 GRC settlement, PSE agreed to propose the inclusion of these costs as part of base rates or the associated tariff schedules implementing PSE's MYRP in its next GRC. For further details regarding the GRC, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Colstrip Adjustment Rider 
 The Schedule 141COL implements surcharges and/or credits to collect or pass back the costs incurred or benefits realized associated with Colstrip Units 1 2 and 3 4 as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066. Beginning in 2026, only decommissioning and remediation related costs will be included in this Schedule in compliance with CETA. 
 
 Conservation Service Rider 
 The Schedule 120 tariff electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates. 
 
 Energy Charge Credit Recovery Adjustment 
 The Schedule 141A implements a surcharge to recover certain costs incurred under the electric Schedule 139 voluntary long term renewable energy purchase rider as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066. The surcharge in this schedule will be updated with each filing that revises the Schedule 139 energy charge credit. 
 
 Federal Incentive Tracker 
 The Schedule 95A passes through to customers the benefits associated with the wind-related treasury grants. The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups. The filing is adjusted annually for new federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. Rates change annually on January 1. 
 
 Low Income Program 
 The Schedule 129 low income tracker tariff recovers changes in costs for the low income bill payment assistance program as approved in Docket No. UE-011570. The annual filing requests these changes through the existing low income program funding mechanism previously approved by the Washington Commission. The mechanism allows PSE to periodically adjust its electric rates to reflect changes in actual sales and costs. Rates change annually on October 1. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Clause 
 The power cost adjustment clause for schedule 95 includes a supplemental filing, variable power cost update and/or PCORC updates. The supplemental filing revises the Schedule 95 in accordance with the petition of PSE for approval of its power cost adjustment mechanism annual report. The variable power cost update is a compliance filing to revise Schedule 95 in accordance with the settlement agreement in the last GRC. 
 10 

Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE currently has a PCA mechanism, under tariff Schedule 95, that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs. The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather (temperature, wind and solar variables), hydroelectric and power market conditions and forecasts. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
 Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism: 
 
 Company's Share 
 Customers Share Annual Power Cost Variability Over 
 Under 
 Over 
 Under Over or under collected up to 17 million 
 100

 Property Tax Tracker 
 The purpose of the Schedule 140 property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. The mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year. 
 
 Rates Not Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of the Schedule 141N tariff is to recover costs approved during a MYRP period that are not subject to refund and that are above the level of base rates set in the MYRP as authorized and approved in Docket No. UE-220066. 
 
 Rates Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of the Schedule 141R tariff is to charge customers the provisional rates subject to refund approved in a MYRP, for property granted recovery as authorized and approved in Docket No. UE-220066. PSE will file an annual review March 31st of each year, which will be reviewed by the Washington Commission. 
 
 Residential and Farm Energy Exchange Benefit 
 The residential exchange program, Schedule 194, passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE receives from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Rates change biennially. 
 
 Transportation Electrification Plan Adjustment Rider 
 Schedule 141TEP implements surcharges to collect costs associated with the implementation of the Company s transportation electrification plan. 
 
 Voluntary Long Term Renewable Energy Charge and Credit 
 The Schedule 139 provides a resource option energy charge for customers taking service in the voluntary renewable energy Green Direct program. This tariff, as authorized in the Washington Commission Docket No. UE-220066, provides a methodology for calculating energy charge credits for energy related power costs components of the energy charge of the customer s electric service schedule. There is also a supplemental energy charge credit to account for the energy related recovery of prior year's power cost adjustment deferral that is being recovered under the supplemental rate in Schedule 95. 
 
 Natural Gas Rate Filings 
 Bill Discount Rate Rider 
 The Schedule 129D tariff bill discount rate rider collects the costs incurred by the Company in providing the rate discounts specified in Schedule 23BDR, including administrative costs approved in Docket No. UG-230693. 
 
 Climate Commitment Act - Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cap and Invest Adjustment 
 The Schedule 111 tariff is to implement a surcharge to recover the costs and to provide benefits through credits to certain customers from the Company s implementation of Washington State greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cap and invest program as prescribed by the CCA and codified in law within RCW 70A.65. 
 11 

Conservation Service Rider 
 The Schedule 120 tariff natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates. 
 
 Cost Recovery Mechanism for Pipeline Replacement 
 The purpose of the cost recovery mechanism (CRM), Schedule 149, is to recover costs related to projects included in PSE's pipeline replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system. Rates change annually on November 1. In its 2022 GRC, PSE requested, and the Washington Commission approved the recovery of its natural gas CRM investments in the MYRP. Effective January 7, 2023, PSE no longer uses the CRM annual filing to recover these pipeline replacement program investments. 
 
 Distribution Pipeline Provisional Recovery Adjustment 
 The purpose of the Schedule 141D tariff is to implement surcharges associated with the provisional recovery of 30.0 million for the four miles of distribution pipe to support proper allocation of the investments in a later filing as authorized in Washington Commission Docket No. UG-220067. 
 
 Low Income Program 
 The Schedule 129 low income tracker tariff recovers changes in costs for the low income bill payment assistance program as approved in Washington Commission Docket No. UG-011571. The annual filing requests these changes through the existing low income program funding mechanism previously approved by the Washington Commission. The mechanism allows PSE to periodically adjust its natural gas rates to reflect changes in actual sales and costs. Rates change annually on October 1. 
 
 Property Tax Tracker 
 The purpose of the Schedule 140 property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. The mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year. 
 
 Purchased Gas Adjustment 
 The PGA mechanism, which includes Schedule 101 and Schedule 106 tariffs, allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest. PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances. A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas costs. Rates typically change annually on November 1, although out-of-cycle rate changes are allowed at other times of the year if needed. 
 
 Rates Not Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of the Schedule 141N tariff is to recover costs approved during a MYRP period that are not subject to refund and that are above the level of base rates set in the MYRP as authorized and approved in Docket No. UG-220067. 
 
 Rates Subject to Refund Rate Adjustment 
 The purpose of the Schedule 141R tariff is to charge customers the provisional rates subject to refund approved in a MYRP, for property granted recovery as authorized and approved in Docket No. UG-220067. PSE will file an annual review March 31st of each year, which will be reviewed by the Washington Commission.

Electric Supply 
 At December 31, 2023, PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 6,512 megawatts (MW). In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments. When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.

 1. Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads. 
 2. The FERC license authorizes the full 54.4 MW; however, the project's water right issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE) limits flow to 2,500 cubic feet and therefore output to 47.7MW. 

Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts 
 During 2023, approximately 11.1 of PSE s energy supply was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia). PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable. 
 16 

For the year ended, December 31, 2023, PSE's portion of the power output of the PUDs projects are set forth below: 
 Company s Annual Share (Approximate) Project Contract Expiration Year Percent of Output MW Capacity Chelan County PUD 1 : 
 Rock Island Project 2031 30.0 187 Rocky Reach Project 2031 30.0 390 Douglas County PUD 2 : 
 Wells Project 2028 32.8 276 Grant County PUD 3 : 
 Priest Rapids Development 2052 4.8 45 Wanapum Development 2052 4.8 52 Total 950 
 ____________ 
 1 PSE currently purchases output from Chelan County PUD's Rock Island and Rocky Reach hydroelectric projects under three separate contracts: 1) a contract for 25 of output that was executed in February 2006 and expires October 31, 2031. In 2023, PSE executed a new contract extending this 25 share of output through October 2051; 2) a contract executed in March 2021 for 5 of output that began on January 1, 2022 and continues through December 31, 2026; and 3) a contract executed during 2023 to purchase an additional 5 of output for each, from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2028. 
 2 PSE currently purchases output from Douglas County PUD's Wells hydroelectric project under two separate contracts: 1) a contract executed in March 2017 with a variable share output (average 11.82 in 2024) that began on September 1, 2018 and ends September 30, 2028; and 2) a contract executed in March 2021 for 5.5 of output from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2024. In 2023, PSE executed a new contract extending this 5.5 share of output through September 30, 2029. 
 3 PSE currently purchases output from Grant County PUD's Wanapum and Priest Rapids hydroelectric developments under two separate contracts: 1) a contract that was executed on December 13, 2001 and began November 1, 2005 under which PSE receives 0.64 of output through expires March 31, 2052; and 2) a contract entered in November 2023 for 4.18 of output that begins on January 1, 2024, and continues through December 31, 2024. PSE reserves the right to renew the latter contract on an annual basis. 

Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements 
 PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region. PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered. PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas Electric Company (PG E) for 300 MW of seasonal capacity exchange. On November 14, 2022, PSE submitted a notice of termination with PG E to terminate the agreement on December 31, 2027. 
 PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016. PSE has committed up to 450 MW of existing BPA transmission for the EIM market. Participation has resulted in reduced costs for PSE customers of approximately 47.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, enhanced system reliability, integration of variable energy resources, and geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources. The calculated benefits represent the annual cost savings of the EIM dispatch compared with a counter-factual dispatch without the EIM. Benefits can take the form of cost savings or revenues or their combination. Benefits include GHG revenues, transfer revenues and flexible ramping revenues. 
 PSE has entered into multiple varying term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system. These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use. Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights. PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes. Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties. PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA. 
 PSE expects to meet its forecasted peak load with a mix of owned and contracted power supply assets delivered on contracted transmission with the remainder being supplied with PSE-owned transmission. In 2023, PSE had 5,040 MW and 595 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively. PSE's portfolio of contracted and owned transmission agreements enables the Company to take advantage of favorable power supply conditions across the WECC in lieu of operating owned generation assets to achieve cost savings. 
 17 

Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers 
 PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet electrical demand through gas-fired generation. Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as natural gas turbine dispatch depends on favorable market heat rates, which can and do vary significantly for a variety of reasons. Gas supply purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta). PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas for power production. PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources. 
 The following table presents the volumes of natural gas for power inventory value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022: 
 At December 31, 2023 2022 Natural gas volumes for power in storage at year end, therms (thousands): Jackson Prairie 13,374 5,450 Plymouth LNG (in LNG form) 1,761 1,223 Clay Basin

NATURAL GAS FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS AND ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS 
 Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers 
 PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta). PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas. All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline, LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory. Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP. 
 For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during periods of high demand or reduced supply. Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose. Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity. Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s natural gas system. Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s Tacoma LNG peaking facility and the Gig Harbor satellite LNG peaking facility, both located within its distribution system, and NWP's Plymouth LNG facility; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary. 
 19 

PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources. PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and transportation capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future. 
 PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins. The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs. Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism. 
 
 Natural Gas Storage Capacity 
 PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers. The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE, and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period. Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility. Of this total, PSE designates 369,600 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 8.4 million Dth of storage capacity to serve natural gas customers. The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements. 
 The remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity of 84,200 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and over 1.4 million Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources. 
 The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection. PSE holds 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of four years and has rights to extend such agreements. Of this total, PSE designates 11.7 million Dth of storage capacity and 97,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity to serve natural gas customers. The remaining Clay Basin storage capacity of 10,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 1.2 million Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio. 
 
 LNG and Propane-Air Resources 
 LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time. Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days. 
 PSE holds a contract for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth. Of this total, PSE designates 15,000 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and 60,000 Dth of storage capacity to serve natural gas customers. The remaining Plymouth storage capacity of 55,500 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 181,700 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE s power portfolio for use of the PSE generation fleet. PSE uses the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE s natural gas customers as well as serve PSE s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis. In addition, PSE holds 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity from Plymouth for natural gas customers. The balance of the LNG capacity is delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE s generation fleet. 
 PSE owns and operates a LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total storage capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day. 
 
 Tacoma LNG Facility 
 On February 1, 2022, the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma completed commissioning and commenced commercial operations. The Tacoma LNG facility provides up to approximately 85,000 Dth per day peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and provides LNG as fuel to transportation customers via Puget Energy's non-regulated subsidiary Puget LNG. Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE is allocated 43.0 of the unassigned common capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility, and Puget LNG is allocated the remaining 57.0 of the unassigned common capital and operating costs. Other common capital and operating costs are allocated using specific or prescribed allocators based on the nature of the cost. The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE is subject to regulation by the Washington Commission. In December 2022, the Washington Commission 
 20 

approved and authorized PSE to seek recovery of costs related to the Tacoma LNG Facility concurrent with its 2023 PGA filing. On May 25, 2023, PSE requested a rate increase of 47.6 million, or 3.5 filed under Docket No. UG-230393 with the Washington Commission. A final ruling on this filing is expected by April 25, 2024. 
 
 Natural Gas Transportation Capacity 
 PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by Cascade Natural Gas Company (CNGC), NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NGTL), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Enbridge Westcoast Energy (Westcoast). GTN, NGTL, and Foothills are all TC Energy Corporation companies. PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements. 
 PSE holds approximately 520,900 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory. In addition, PSE holds approximately 397,100 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie to natural gas customers. PSE holds approximately 218,400 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities. In addition, PSE holds over 84,200 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities. PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 21 years. However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. 
 PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is 135,800 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of six years. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 88,400 Dth per day, with remaining terms of seven years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract. PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NGTL and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 79,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of seven years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NGTL and Foothills pipelines. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NGTL and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of five years. PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, with a remaining term of two years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,600 Dth per day, with remaining terms of five years. PSE holds 259,000 Dth per day of firm capacity on CNGC to connect generating facilities to the pipeline grid with remaining terms of one year. 
 
 Capacity Release 
 The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction. Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity. The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement. PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio. PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release. Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism. 

Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development 
 PSE is required by the Washington Commission and state law to file natural gas and electric integrated resource plans (IRP). In 2021, PSE submitted its 2021 natural gas IRP and on March 31, 2023 submitted its 2023 natural gas IRP to the Washington Commission. Specific to electric, Washington Administrative Code 480-100-625 requires PSE to file an electric IRP every four years and a progress report every two years beginning in 2023. In 2021, PSE submitted its electric IRP and on March 31, 2023 PSE submitted its 2023 electric progress report. 
 One key consideration included in the IRP is capacity. For the 2023 electric progress report, based on the cumulative capacity need by year, the capacity shortfalls are: 
 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Projected MW shortfall/(surplus) 174 465 1,336 1,848 2,096 
 
 21 

Due to growing regional concerns pertaining to capacity within the short-term market, PSE plans to phase out its reliance on firm short-term market purchases by over 200 MW per year starting in 2024 until PSE reaches zero reliance on firm short-term market purchases by 2029. With the expected elimination of Colstrip units 3 and 4 from PSE s energy supply portfolio starting in 2026, which removes approximately 370 MW of coal generation capacity, and the expiration of PSE s 380 MW coal-transition contract with TransAlta when the Centralia coal plant is retired at the end of 2025, the projected capacity shortfall of 174 MW in 2024 increases to 1,336 MW, 1,848 MW and 2,096 MW by 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2023 Progress Report. As part of the Washington CETA, PSE must achieve sales with renewable or non-emitting resources of at least 80 by 2030 and 100 by 2045. Another aspect of the IRP relates to PSE s current transmission portfolio, which includes approximately 1,500 MW of firm transmission rights that deliver energy from the Mid Columbia trading hub to the PSE load center. 
 On February 10, 2023, the FERC approved a voluntary regional resource adequacy program that PSE plans to participate in along with other utilities in the western United States and Canada. The program is intended to help the region anticipate its future power supply needs as natural gas-fired and coal power plants retire and are replaced by variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar. 

Energy Efficiency 
 PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available electric and natural gas conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently. PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices. PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms. However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales. To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2017 from the Washington Commission for continuation of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts. The decoupling mechanisms, as approved in 2022 GRC Final Order in Dockets No. UE-220066 and UG-220067 commenced January 7, 2023 for natural gas and January 11, 2023 for electric and will remain in place until such time that PSE proposes and the Washington Commission approves to have them discontinued or modified. 

Environment 
 PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities. See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs. 
 
 Air and Climate Change Protection 
 PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip. All of the natural gas plants and Colstrip are governed by the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and its state counterparts, and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years. This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants. PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants. These facilities also emit GHGs, and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation including the CCA and the CETA. The Colstrip plant represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions. 
 
 Species Protection 
 PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of electric distribution and transmission lines that can be impacted by laws related to species protection. Several species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints. Similarly, there are several avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Prohibitions and permitting requirements set forth in these statutes and related regulations have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and transmission and distribution systems. 
 
 Remediation 
 PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were 
 22 

allegedly generated, transported and/or released. The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act. PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip. Under all of these laws, PSE may be subject to agency orders to carry out site remediation. These laws impose joint and several liability on any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, transporters, as well as any entity that generated and disposed of (or arranged for the disposal of) hazardous or other regulated substances at a contaminated site. 
 
 Hazardous and Solid Waste and Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) Handling and Disposal 
 Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes, including PCB waste from pre-1979 electrical equipment. These actions are regulated by the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and Toxic Substances Control Act, and state hazardous or dangerous waste regulations that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances. 
 
 Water Protection 
 PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products, and PSE construction projects above a certain threshold are governed by the federal Clean Water Act, which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments, as well as their state counterparts. This includes most generation facilities (and all of those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage. 
 
 Mercury Emissions 
 Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement. Compliance, based on a rolling twelve-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement. 
 
 Siting New Facilities 
 In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the state Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible state laws and local siting, critical area and zoning ordinances. Such facilities may also be subject to federal environmental regulations. These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities. 

Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation 
 Recent and future environmental laws and regulations have been and may be adopted at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations. PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets. Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental laws and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs. 
 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 PSE implements both short-term measures and long-term strategies designed to manage GHG emissions in a scientifically sound and responsible fashion. The Company has worked closely with federal, state and local governments on decarbonization and the reduction and mitigation of GHG emissions, including passage of CETA, the CCA, and the Clean Fuels Standard. As a result, the Company announced a goal to be coal free by 2025 consistent with CETA requirements, and net zero carbon emissions for electric and natural gas operations (i.e., known methane leaks from pipeline system) as well as electric supply by 2030. Further, the Company set an aspirational goal to be net zero by 2045 for natural gas sales and to go beyond reducing PSE's own GHG footprint by helping Washington address GHG emissions from the transportation sector by upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure to accommodate more widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoptions and providing liquefied natural gas for maritime transportation. The Company considers the cost of the decarbonization efforts to date, as well as future efforts, in its IRP process and development of transformational customer programs, and will continue to engage in climate change and GHG emissions policy development. 
 
 23 

Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting 
 PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the WDOE including emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs, electric distribution and transmission line losses, certain natural gas distribution facilities and operations, and natural gas sales. Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
 The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2022 were 9.46 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Approximately 28.4 of total electric supply portfolio GHG emissions (approximately 2.68 million metric tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip. Compared to 2021, total emissions increased by 3.7 . This trend is due primarily to an increase in output from Colstrip Units 3 and 4 from increased electric demand and decreased availability of PSE renewable generation and natural gas generation. 
 PSE s overall emissions strategy continues to add new renewable resources to its generation portfolio and demonstrate a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE, and significant energy efficiency efforts. 
 PSE s GHG emissions resulting from the complete combustion of natural gas provided to end-users on PSE s distribution systems were 5.78 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. 
 
 Executive Orders Addressing Environmental Issues 
 Since entering office, President Biden issued several executive orders that are likely to affect PSE s environmental obligations. The executive orders revoked several existing executive orders and established new federal environmental mandates, including rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change, which requires commitments to reduce GHG emissions, among other things. 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA is intended to lower gasoline and electricity prices, increase energy security, and help consumers to afford emission-cutting technologies. In addition, the IRA will provide tax credits for clean electricity sources and renewable technologies, such as solar and wind. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts and opportunities associated with the IRA on its operations and financial condition, and anticipates utilization of tax credits under the IRA in future periods. As of December 31, 2023, the IRA had no material impact to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules: New and Existing Power Plants 
 The EPA sets rules that apply to both new and existing power plants regarding GHGs. In 2015, the EPA set a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO 2 from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the CAA. New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs. of CO 2 /megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology. New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs. of CO 2 /MWh. Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) was reaffirmed by the EPA in this rule as the best system of emission reductions (BSER). In 2018, due to the high cost and limited geographic availability of CCS, the EPA issued a proposed rule that the BSER for newly constructed coal-fired units is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices, but did not take action on a final rule. In January 2021, the EPA issued a framework for determining when standards are appropriate for GHG emissions from stationary source categories under CAA section 111(b)(1)(A). 
 In August 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA, referred to as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants. In June 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP rule and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, which established emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired plants. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) vacated the ACE rule and remanded it to the Agency for further consideration consistent with its opinion, after finding that the EPA had misinterpreted the CAA when adopting the ACE rule. The Supreme Court granted review of the D.C. Circuit's decision and in June 2022, the Supreme Court found that the EPA lacked clear congressional authority to require generation shifting under Section 111(d). In response to this decision, the D.C. Circuit recalled its partial mandate vacating the ACE Rule and granted a motion by the EPA to hold pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while the EPA developed a replacement rule. 
 On May 23, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal the ACE Rule, revise the NSPS under Section 111(b) for GHG emissions from new fossil fuel-fired stationary combustion turbine electric generating units (EGUs) and from fossil-fuel fired steam generating units that undertake a large modification, and establish emissions guidelines under Section 111(d) for GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating EGUs and from the largest, most frequently operating 
 24 

stationary combustion turbines. On November 20, 2023, the EPA issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding mechanisms to help ensure that the proposed Section 111(d) regulations can be implemented without adversely affecting the reliability of the electrical grid. The EPA has indicated that it anticipates issuing a final rule in April 2024. 
 
 Washington Climate Commitment Act 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the CCA, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that requires covered entities, including electric and gas utilities, to purchase allowances to cover their GHG emissions with a cap on available allowances beginning on January 1, 2023 that declines annually through 2050. The Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) published final regulations on September 29, 2022, which became effective on October 30, 2022. Allowances can be obtained through quarterly auctions, or bought and sold on a secondary market. 
 As an electric utility, PSE is required to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for GHG emissions associated with electricity generated in or imported into the state to serve Washington load, and all electricity generated by Washington PSE facilities with total annual emissions exceeding 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. As an electric utility subject to Washington s CETA, which is discussed below, PSE receives emission allowances from WDOE at no cost through 2050 for direct emissions associated with electricity used to serve Washington State load to eliminate the cost burden of the program on electric ratepayers. 
 As a gas utility, PSE is required to obtain emission allowances for GHG emissions associated with (i) natural gas supplied to customers and (ii) any natural gas system associated facilities with emissions that exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. PSE receives some no-cost emission allowances from WDOE to mitigate impacts to natural gas ratepayers. WDOE's allocation of no-cost allowances to PSE is based on a percentage of PSE baseline natural gas system related emissions (determined from 2015-2019 natural gas system related emissions) and declines annually in proportion with the Washington State carbon goals reaching zero no-cost allowances in 2050. 
 Offset credit use is limited and is not additive to allowances; the WDOE subtracts any offsets used from the total allowance budget. In the first compliance period, 2023-2026, participating entities can cover up to 5 of their emissions with offset credits, and can cover an additional 3 with credits from projects on federally recognized Tribal lands. In the second compliance period, 2027-2030, the general limit drops to 4 , with an additional 2 from projects on Tribal lands. 
 In 2023, the WDOE announced an intent to pursue an agreement with California to link with its cap and trade program which is administered by the California Air Resources Board. 
 
 Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act 
 In May 2019, Washington passed the CETA, which supports Washington's clean energy economy and transitioning to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. The CETA requires all electric utilities to eliminate coal-fired generation from their electric supply to customers by December 31, 2025; to be carbon-neutral by January 1, 2030 through a combination of non-emitting electric generation, renewable generation, and/or alternative compliance options; and makes it the state policy that, by 2045, 100 of electric generation and retail electricity sales will come from renewable or non-emitting resources. Clean energy implementation plans are required every four years from each investor-owned utility (IOU). The plan must propose interim targets for meeting the 2045 standard between 2030 and 2045 and describe an actionable plan that the IOU intends to pursue to meet the standard. The Washington Commission may approve, reject or recommend alterations to an IOU s plan. The Company intends to seek recovery of any costs associated with CETA through the regulatory process. On December 17, 2021, PSE filed its Final CEIP, which proposed a plan for the implementation of CETA for 2022-2025 and associated project costs. On June 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s CEIP, subject to conditions. On November 2, 2023, PSE filed a Biennial CEIP Update with the Commission. 
 
 Regional Haze Rule 
 In January 2017, the EPA revised the Regional Haze Rule. Among other things, these revisions delayed new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021; however, the end date will remain 2028. As such, states were required to prepare State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for the second planning period by July 31, 2021. Washington submitted its SIP revision in January 2022. Montana submitted its SIP revision in August 2022. The EPA has yet to take final action on either SIP and is subject to pending litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to require the EPA to take action on these SIPs, as well as SIPs for several other states. 
 
 Coal Combustion Residuals 
 In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 2015, which regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The CCR rule currently is self-implementing at a federal level or can be implemented and enforced by a state. The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of 
 25 

contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage. 
 In addition to the EPA's CCR rule, in 2012 the operator of Colstrip and the state of Montana entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) that also addresses clean up and closure of CCR units at Colstrip. The CCR rule and the AOC require significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of ash material at Colstrip in 2003. Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO). 
 In 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned certain provisions of the CCR rule and remanded some of its provisions back to the EPA. As a result of that decision and certain other developments, the EPA has continued to work on developing new rules regarding CCR, including establishing a presumptive date of April 11, 2021, for facilities to stop placing coal ash into unlined surface impoundments. Most recently, in May 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule to expand the scope of the units subject to the federal CCR regulations to include inactive surface impoundments at inactive generating facilities, as well as CCR management units at facilities otherwise subject to federal CCR regulation. In addition, the EPA has proposed a federal permitting program for coal ash disposal units along with the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation Act (WIIN Act). The WIIN Act allows states to develop a state program for the regulation of CCR in lieu of the federal CCR rule, and also authorizes the EPA to develop a federal permitting program. Currently, Montana has not applied for a state permit program, and the EPA has not yet finalized a federal permitting program.

 To attract employees that meet the needs of the Company s skilled workforce, the Company offers employee benefits that are a component of the Company s total compensation package. Employee benefits include medical, health and dental insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death insurance, and retirement programs, including a 401(k) plan. For non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, along with IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, two retirement contribution sources from PSE are provided: 
 401(k) Company Matching: non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees PSE will match 100 on the first 3.0 of pay contributed and 50.0 on the next 3.0 of pay contributed, such that an employee who contributes 6.0 of pay will receive 4.5 of pay in company match. Company matching will be immediately vested. 
 Company Contribution: UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0 of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0 of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE s Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4.0 contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan. The Company's 4.0 contribution will vest after three years of service. 
 For additional details on company retirement benefits see Item 8 (for employees hired prior to January 1, 2014) and Item 11 of this report. 
 
 Employee Development 
 The Company offers development opportunities to employees. Some of the programs are: 
 Employee wellness program: PSE maintains a wellness program that offers a wide range of resources and tools at little or no cost to employees and their families, including company sponsored wellness events and ongoing health and wellness communications. The PSE program also includes resources and tools that focus on mental health and wellbeing. 
 Employee engagement: PSE has been conducting the Great Place to Work survey since 2001 in an ongoing effort to create a culture that supports company values and enables PSE to do its best work on behalf of its customers and communities. The Company also conducts periodic pulse surveys to engage employees on relevant topics and provide them with opportunities to inform decisions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO PSE s REGULATORY AND RATE-MAKING PROCEDURES 
 PSE's regulated utility business is subject to various federal and state regulations. PSE's regulatory risks include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below. 
 
 The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities. The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services are the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC. 
 PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters. In addition, proceedings with the Washington Commission typically involve multiple stakeholder parties, including consumer and environmental advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing regulatory perspectives and concerns but who collectively share a common objective of limiting rate increases proposed by the Company and keeping the Company's rates as low as possible over time. Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators and intervening parties could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed. Traditionally, the Washington Commission determined the rates PSE may charge its electric and natural gas retail customers based, in part, on historic costs during a particular test year, adjusted for certain normalizing adjustments. In 2021, Washington enacted into state law Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill (ESSB) 5295, which among other things amended RCW 80.28 to require electric and natural gas utilities to file forward looking MYRPs as part of their general rate case filings. PSE filed its first rate case under this updated statute in 2022 in Dockets UE-220066 and UG-220067 and the Washington Commission subsequently approved rates in this case predicated on a projection of costs expected to occur during the rate years of the MYRP. The changes to RCW 80.28 did not materially change the recovery of power and natural gas costs. As has been the case for many years, power costs are normalized for market, weather and hydrological conditions projected to occur during the applicable rate year, the ensuing twelve-month period after rates become effective. Similarly, natural gas costs are adjusted through the PGA mechanism, as discussed previously. If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than the amounts used by the Washington Commission to determine the rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs. In addition, the Washington Commission has the authority to determine what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates. For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period. 
 
 PSE is currently subject to a state law that requires PSE to share its excess earnings above the authorized rate of return with customers. In addition to requiring electric and natural gas utilities to file MYRPs, ESSB 5295 also requires PSE to defer revenues that are in excess of 50 basis points higher than the authorized rate of return. The deferred amounts may be refunded to customers or applied in some other way as determined by the Washington Commission. The earnings test is performed for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so PSE would be obligated to share the earnings for one service exceeding the authorized rate of return, even if the other service did not exceed the authorized rate of return. 
 
 The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate. In contrast to the PGA mechanism which is a direct pass through of costs, the PCA mechanism provides recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and 
 29 

hydrological conditions. Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO PSE s OPERATION 
 
 PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers. The utility business involves many operating risks. If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected. Factors which could cause PSE's purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its energy supply needs and/or purchases in wholesale markets of high volumes of energy at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to: 
 Below normal levels of generation by PSE-owned hydroelectric resources due to low streamflow conditions or precipitation and snowpack; 
 Extended outages of any of PSE-owned generating facilities or the transmission lines that deliver energy to load centers, or the effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure; and 
 Failure of a counterparty to deliver capacity or energy purchased by PSE. 
 
 PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs. PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, and wind-powered generating facilities. Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or increase expenditures, including: 
 Facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes; 
 Volatility in prices for fuel and fuel transportation; 
 Disruptions in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories; 
 Regulatory compliance obligations and related costs, including any required environmental remediation, and any new laws and regulations that necessitate significant investments in our generating facilities; 
 Labor disputes; 
 Operator error or safety related stoppages; 
 Terrorist or other attacks (both cyber-based and/or asset-based); and 
 Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature. 
 
 Cyber-attacks, including cyber-terrorism, foreign-state support cyber threats or other information technology security breaches, or information technology failures may disrupt business operations, increase costs, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage PSE's reputation. Security breaches of PSE's information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism, or other failures of PSE's information technology infrastructure could lead to disruptions of PSE's production and distribution operations, and otherwise adversely impact PSE's ability to safely and effectively operate electric and natural gas systems and serve customers. In addition, an attack on or failure of information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, employee or Company data that is crucial to PSE's operational security or could adversely affect PSE's ability to deliver and collect on customer bills. Such security breaches of PSE's information technology infrastructure or of third-party vendors on whom we may rely to host, maintain, modify, and update our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our operations and business reputation, diminish customer confidence, subject PSE to financial liability or increased regulation, expose PSE to fines or material legal claims and liability and adversely affect our financial results. PSE has implemented preventive, detective and remediation measures to manage these risks, and maintains cyber risk insurance to mitigate the effects of these events. Nevertheless, these may not effectively protect all of PSE's systems all of the time. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber-events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect PSE s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Natural disasters such as wildfires and catastrophic events, including terrorist acts, may adversely affect PSE's business and expose the Company to liability. Events such as wildfires, earthquakes, floods, tornadoes and other extreme weather 
 30 

events, explosions, vandalism, terrorist acts, and other similar occurrences, could damage PSE's operational assets, including utility facilities, information technology infrastructure, distributed generation assets and pipeline assets. Such events could likewise damage the operational assets of PSE's suppliers or customers. These events could disrupt PSE's ability to meet customer requirements, significantly increase PSE's response costs, cause reputational harm and significantly decrease PSE's revenues. Unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on PSE's operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Wildfires and other natural disasters affecting PSE's infrastructure may expose PSE to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. The risk of catastrophic and severe wildfires has increased in the western U.S. giving rise to the potential for large damage claims against utilities for fire-related losses. Climate change may worsen hot and dry summer conditions, which increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from PSE s equipment. Wildfires alleged to have been caused by PSE's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from PSE s or its contractors operating or maintenance practices, could expose PSE to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental pollution, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. 
 PSE maintains insurance coverage for natural disasters and catastrophic events like wildfires, sabotage and terrorism, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover PSE s ultimate liability. The availability of insurance coverage has been and will likely continue to be limited, and has been and will likely continue to result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms to the extent commercially sourced insurance remains available. 
 An increase in wildfires and other extreme events, even in areas beyond PSE s service territory, has and will likely continue to negatively impact insurance markets and availability and cost of our insurance coverage. Coverage limits within insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs if there are events that are not covered by PSE s insurance policies. PSE may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if PSE is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, PSE s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected. 
 
 PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets. In connection with matching PSE's energy needs and available resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities. Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations for delivery of energy supply or contractually required payments related to PSE's energy supply portfolio. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected. Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted. 
 
 Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs or reduced revenue related to compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the occurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations. PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities. In addition, recent laws proposed or passed by the State of Washington and various municipalities in PSE's service territory, including Seattle, seek to reduce or eliminate the use of natural gas in various contexts, such as for space and water heating in new commercial and multifamily buildings. As a result of these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money to comply with these measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, adoption of mitigation measures, use of pollution control equipment, and emissions-related abatement and fees. New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations or restricting the use of products sold by PSE may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities. Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE or reduce revenue and thus adversely affect PSE financially. There is potential that PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates in a timely manner. Other risks related to PSE's compliance with such regulations include, but are not limited to: changes to ratemaking by state and federal regulators, including recovery methodologies over PSE's energy costs, market uncertainty, customer rate impacts, customer satisfaction and loyalty, cash liquidity and credit volatility. 
 Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated. The occurrence of a material 
 31 

environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s operations and financial condition. Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and GHG legislation, including CETA and CCA, and PSE anticipates full compliance with these requirements. 
 
 PSE's inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary infrastructure to comply with new and emerging laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Potential changes in regulatory standards, impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and those seeking to combat climate change, and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our energy resource portfolio. An abundance of low, stably priced natural gas, contrasted by environmental, regulatory, and other concerns surrounding coal-fired generation resources, fossil fuel infrastructure bans, and energy resource portfolio requirements, including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures, creates conflicting strategic challenges related to the Company's generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix. 
 In expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels including natural gas, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of natural gas infrastructure projects. These efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables, including the future course of local, state and federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities. PSE cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct natural gas infrastructure projects in the future. 
 
 PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be impacted by various impacts of climate change. PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results. Demand for electricity is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating, however summer weather events can result in material impacts. Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter. In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. PSE's hydroelectric resources are also dependent on snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest. 
 Climate change could also have significant physical effects in PSE s operational territory, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, wind, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, floods, cold weather events, and other extreme weather events. Such extreme weather events could impact transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, resulting in service interruptions and extended or mass outages, which may adversely impact operations and financial results. Costs incurred due to such events may not be recovered through rates if not approved for recovery by the Washington Commission. Additionally, extreme weather events impact customer energy needs and can significantly impact demand, thus increasing wholesale prices for power that PSE purchases to serve customers. PSE has regulatory mechanisms in place to mitigate the effects of price volatility, however, such mechanisms require regulatory approval and may not function as intended. 
 
 PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and natural gas infrastructure system. PSE maintains emergency planning and training programs to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events that interrupt service to customers. To respond to these extreme events, PSE relies upon the availability of outside contractors (including industry-wide mutual assistance from third party public utilities) which may impact service restoration timing and the quality of service provided to PSE s customers. In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events and the magnitude or the event itself may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended periods of time. 
 
 PSE depends on its work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services and may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees or the unavailability of vendors. PSE is subject to workforce factors, including but not limited to loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel. PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers. Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings. Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees could reduce earnings and cash flows. 
 PSE continues to be concerned about the availability of skilled workers to perform necessary utility functions to provide service to customers. PSE also hires third party vendors to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission construction and maintenance, electric and natural gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and 
 32 

collections. The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s natural gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations. 
 
 Potential municipalization may adversely affect PSE's financial condition. PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action. When a town, city, county, or portion of a county in PSE's service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility or public utility district, it acquires PSE's assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that PSE provides. Although PSE is generally compensated in connection with such transactions, the level of compensation is subject to regulatory approval and may not fully compensate PSE for the loss of customers and related revenues, which could negatively affect PSE's future financial condition. 
 
 Changes in customer growth and customer usage may have an adverse impact on PSE s financial condition. Changes in the number of customers and customer usage are driven by many variables including, but not limited to: population changes in PSE s service territory, expansion or loss of service area, inflationary pressures and economic conditions, changes to customer needs and expectations, regulatory environment and state and federal legislation, customer-generated power, demand response, and transportation electrification. Such factors may adversely impact the Company by increasing competition, decreasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy. In contrast, some factors, such as transportation electrification and electric heating sources, among others, may result in unexpected demand for energy, which could lead to PSE being required to purchase power at higher-costs to meet peak demands. Further, changes in such customer use could necessitate the need for PSE to accelerate investment in additional generation, distribution, transmission, and storage resources beyond current resource planning. Such changes could result in significant expenditures by PSE or reduce revenue and thus adversely affect PSE financially. There is potential that PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates in a timely manner. 
 
 PSE may face risks related to health crises such as epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. We face various risks related to health crises such as epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, which may materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and ongoing operations. As most recently evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, health crises can adversely affect economic activity within Washington and the United States of America, and more specifically, our business and results of operations, by, among other things, reducing customer demand for electricity and natural gas, reducing the availability and productivity of our employees, contractors and vendors, increasing our costs, delaying payments from our customers and increasing uncollectible accounts, delaying and disrupting supply chains, disrupting the financial markets which negatively impacted on our ability to access, and cost of, capital, deteriorating our financial metrics and ability to meet the covenants of our credit facilities, and disrupting our ability to meet customer requirements. 
 
 PSE could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy and rising geopolitical tensions, such as those caused by the ongoing military conflicts between Israel and Hamas and Russia and Ukraine. The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Governments including the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union imposed import and export controls on certain products and economic sanctions on certain industries and parties in Russia. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, such as the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, and increased costs, including energy costs, which may adversely affect our business operations and supply chain, and ultimately, PSE's ability to serve customer demand and needs on timely basis, which may negatively impact PSE's financial performance. 
 
 RISKS RELATING TO PUGET ENERGY'S AND PSE'S FINANCING 
 
 The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital. The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE. If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be necessary for future growth, could be adversely affected. Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the unavailability of or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial condition of 
 33 

Puget Energy or PSE may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing, adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets, their ability to pay dividends and service outstanding debt obligations. 
 
 The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations. Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future. Puget Energy has access to a multi-year 800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of May 14, 2027. There was 261.5 million outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2023. Puget Energy's credit facility includes an expansion feature that could, subject to the commitment of one or more lenders, increase the size of the facility to 1.3 billion. PSE also has a separate credit facility, which provides PSE with access to a multi-year 800.0 million revolving credit facility, and includes an expansion feature that could, subject to the commitment of one or more lenders, increase the size of the facility to 1.4 billion. The PSE credit facility matures on May 14, 2027. As of December 31, 2023, no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facility. In addition, Puget Energy has issued 2.0 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2023, had approximately 5.2 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds and senior notes. The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to: 
 Making it difficult to satisfy obligations under the debt agreements and increasing the risk of default on the debt obligations; 
 Making it difficult to fund non-debt service related operations of the business; and 
 Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital, the ability to hedge in wholesale markets and the ability to pay dividends. Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities. For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (or other applicable index) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline. A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs. 
 Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs. 
 PSE may not declare or make any dividend distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0. 
 
 Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity. PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees. Costs of providing these benefits are based, in part, on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase PSE's funding requirements related to the pension plans. Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2024 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in GRCs could adversely impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity. 
 
 34 

RISKS RELATING TO PUGET ENERGY'S CORPORATE STRUCTURE 
 
 Puget Energy's ability to pay dividends may be limited. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy. PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition. If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends. 
 The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. In addition, beginning February 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio calculated on a regulatory basis is 44.0 or below, except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission. Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE's ability to declare or make any distribution is limited by its corporate credit/issuer rating and EBITDA to interest ratio, as previously discussed above. The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.1 at December 31, 2023, and the EBITDA to interest expense ratio was 5.2 to 1.0 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023. 
 PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants. 
 
 Challenges relating to the operation of the Tacoma LNG facility could adversely affect the Company s operations. The Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma, a facility jointly owned by PSE and Puget Energy s subsidiary, Puget LNG, is intended to provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and to provide LNG as fuel primarily to the maritime market. Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility s expected output to other potential customers. Disruptions in the facility s operation or in its ability to timely deliver fuel to customers could expose Puget LNG to damages under one or more fuel supply contracts, which could unfavorably impact Puget Energy s return on investment. 
 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. The Company is subject to numerous laws and regulations that materially impact operations and financial condition. Specific legislation and regulations, including proposals, that impact the Company include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, carbon reduction, climate change and environmental regulation, accounting regulations, and infrastructure regulation. Changes in current laws and regulations, proposed legislation and the interpretation of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Commonly, laws and related regulations are inherently complex, and thus, the Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law and corresponding impacts to our operations and financial condition. Disputes over interpretations of laws may be settled with the relevant authority overseeing certain laws and regulation, upon appeal or through litigation. 
 A citizen sponsored initiative to repeal the CCA is currently pending before the Washington legislature. The legislature could enact it and repeal the CCA, take no action, or propose a competing measure. If the legislature takes no action during the 2024 legislative session ending March 7, 2024, the initiative will be placed on the ballot for the next statewide general election in November 2024 for voter consideration. If the legislature enacts a competing measure, both alternatives would go before the voters in November 2024. At this time PSE cannot predict the outcome of such a vote. 
 
 Potential legal proceedings and claims could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business. The Company is, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s attention and resources. While management believes the Company has reasonable and prudent insurance coverage and accrues loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and/or its results of operations. 
 
 35 

The Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by inflationary pressures. Such inflationary pressures could result in increased labor, commodities, materials and supplies, outside services and capital costs, among others, that may not be offset by an increase in revenues, which would adversely affect the Company s results of operations. Continued inflationary pressures, an economic downturn, or a recession could also negatively impact customer use or ability to pay for services rendered and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. While regulatory mechanisms exist to partially mitigate the impacts of inflation on commodity prices, the Company cannot assure that rising inflation will not have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 PSE maintains a comprehensive business continuity plan that includes the identification, assessment and management of risks arising from various avenues, including cyber. Business continuity includes action plans to respond to and remedy information technology (IT) outages, attacks, and other cyber threats, which are maintained between two specific plans, the IT disaster recovery plan and the cybersecurity incident response plan (CSIRP). The CSIRP specifies guidance for various cyber related risks to ensure business continuity and timely reporting of incidents to various governing bodies, including the SEC. The CSIRP is a perpetually updated plan that is managed by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Chief Information Officer (CIO). PSE's CIO has served in various roles in IT and IT security for over 15 years, including serving as Chief Operating Officer or Chief Information Officer primarily in the financial services industry. Further, the CIO holds an undergraduate degree in computer science. PSE's CISO has over 15 years of experience managing IT security across different industries and companies. Additionally, the CISO holds an undergraduate degree and has been a Certified Information Systems Security Professional for over 15 years. 
 As part of the CSIRP, PSE maintains a standalone team of IT security and risk management professionals in the Cyber Defense Center (CDC). The CDC is responsible for implementing the CSIRP, including the identification and ongoing monitoring and response to all cyber events and risks, including risks associated with the Company s use of third-party service providers, which impact the Company. To identify, defend, detect and respond to cyber events, PSE performs various on-going activities, such as, proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, monitoring threat intelligence information feeds, penetration testing to test security controls, conducting employee trainings, and monitoring emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security. Additionally, the Company conducts tabletop exercises to simulate our response to cybersecurity incidents. Depending on the nature of the incident, PSE may engage consultants, assessors, or other third-parties to assist in the assessment, testing, remediation, and/or management of cyber incidents. 
 Once cyber incidents are identified in the CDC, a risk assessment is performed as part of the CSIRP by the CDC. The risk assessment includes quantitative and qualitative considerations determined by a committee of individuals, including, among others, the Controller, CISO and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, that report to the Chief Financial Officer, CIO, and Senior Vice President General Counsel and Chief Sustainability Officer. Any cyber incidents that exceed set thresholds in the CSIRP are then escalated to the aforementioned committee for a materiality assessment and disclosure considerations. 
 The Company's Audit Committee oversees management's process for identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks. Periodically, the CISO presents cyber incidents and risks to the audit committee as part of the board of directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee's oversight includes understanding existing and new cybersecurity risks and status on management's response and mitigation plans. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of (i) any cybersecurity incidents, or (ii) any specific cybersecurity threats, that, in either case, materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the business, strategy, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company. However, we can provide no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity threats or incidents in the future or that they will not materially affect PSE, including our business, strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. For more information regarding risk from cybersecurity threats, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" included in this report. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Natural Gas Supply. PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties. Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures. The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Contingencies arising out of the Company's normal course of business existed as of December 31, 2023. Litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. For further details, see Note 16, "Commitments and Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 SEC regulations require the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations and given the size of the Company's operations, PSE elected a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any matters that exceed this threshold and meet the definition for disclosure. 
 For information on litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings, see Note 15, "Litigation" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. For information on environmental remediation, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

 Overview 
 
 Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which has the sole purpose of owning and operating the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCIMC), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS), PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V., Macquarie Washington Clean Energy Investment, L.P., and Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company. 
 PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs. 
 Factors affecting PSE's performance are set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure . Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a presentation that is not defined by GAAP. The Company believes that its return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, also a non-GAAP 
 38 

measure, is a suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a relevant metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE. The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity. PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures. Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (GAAP net income divided by GAAP average common equity) as an indicator of operating performance. 
 The following table presents PSE s ROE, its return on AMA equity and its authorized regulated ROE for 2023 and 2022: 2023 2022 (Dollars in Thousands) Earnings Average Common Equity Return on Equity Earnings Average Common Equity Return on Equity Return on equity 131,059 4,960,936 2.6 490,952 4,613,257 10.6 Less/Plus: Unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, after-tax 224,751 (206,330) Plus: Equity adjustments 1 
 70,908 (108,984) Plus: Impact of average of monthly average (AMA) (77,648) 127,482 Return on AMA equity 355,810 4,954,196 7.2 284,622 4,631,755 6.1 Authorized regulated return on equity 2 
 9.4 9.4 
 _______________ 
 1. Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 2. The authorized regulated return on equity rate per the approved 2022 and 2019 GRC is 9.4 for natural gas and electric effective January 1, 2023 for the 2022 GRC and for natural gas and electric effective October 1, 2020 and October 15, 2020, respectively for the 2019 GRC. 
 Not meaningful and/or applicable. 
 
 The Company s 2023 return on AMA equity was 7.2 , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following: 
 Regulated equity (rate base multiplied by equity percent) was 683.7 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2023. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.3 . The variance was primarily driven by investment in items that do not earn a return or earn a return that is less than the authorized ROE. 
 Plant placed in service which receives deferred accounting treatment, but for which the equity return is not yet able to be recognized, consisting of the AMI and Tacoma LNG investments, which resulted in 22.9 million of deferred return that has not yet been recognized impacting ROE by negative 0.5 . 
 Plant placed in service earlier than planned resulted in higher depreciation expense and a lower rate of return in the amount of 17.8 million on an after-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2023, for an impact on ROE of negative 0.4 . 
 Power cost recovery was 20.7 million higher than the amount allowed in rates on an after-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2023, for an impact on ROE of positive 0.4 . 
 
 The Company s 2022 return on AMA equity was 6.1 , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following: 
 Regulated equity (rate base multiplied by equity percent) was 589.3 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.2 . The variance was primarily driven by investment in items that do not earn a return or earn a return that is less than the authorized ROE. Such items include investment in construction work in progress, significant in service projects such as, AMI and Tacoma LNG, and growth in rate base since the last GRC. 
 Depreciation expense was 18.0 million higher than the amount allowed in rates on an after-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, for an impact on ROE of negative 0.4 . 
 Operations and maintenance expense, including production operations and maintenance, was 61.5 million higher than the amount allowed in rates on an after-tax basis for the year ended December 31, 2022, for an impact on ROE of negative 1.3 .

Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance 
 PSE s ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2023 and will continue to do so in future years. Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include: 
 The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services; 
 PSE s ability to recover power costs that are subject to the Company's power cost adjustment mechanism that are included in rates, which are based on volume; 
 Weather conditions, including the impact of temperature on customer load; the impact of extreme weather events on budgeted maintenance costs; meteorological conditions such as snow-pack, stream-flow and wind-speed which affect power generation, supply and price; 
 The effects of climate change, including changes in the environment that may affect energy costs or consumption, increase the Company s costs, or adversely affect its operations; 
 Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis; 
 PSE s ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets; 
 Deferral of excess revenues if earnings exceed PSE's authorized rate of return (ROR) by more than 0.5 ; 
 Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital; 
 Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, such as the Climate Commitment Act (CCA); 
 Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas; 
 Increasing capital expenditures with additional depreciation and amortization; 
 Failure to complete capital projects on schedule and within budget or the abandonment of capital projects, either of which could result in the Company s inability to recover project costs or refund previously collected revenues; 
 Changes in customer growth and customer usage; 
 Tax reform, the effect of lower tax rates, and regulatory treatment of excess deferred tax balances on rate base and customer rates; 
 General economic conditions, such as inflation, in PSE's service territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; 
 Federal, state, and local taxes; 
 Employee workforce factors, including potential strikes, work stoppages, transitions in senior management, and loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel; 
 The effectiveness of PSE s risk management policies and procedures; 
 Cybersecurity incidents and/or attacks, data security breaches, or other malicious acts that cause damage to the Company s generation and transmission facilities or information technology systems, or result in the release of confidential customer, employee, or Company information; 
 Acts of war or terrorism locally or abroad, or the impact of civil unrest to infrastructure or preventing access to infrastructure and its impact on the supply chain and prices of goods and services; 
 Natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides and windstorms, the rise in frequency and magnitude of extreme temperature events, and possible accidents, explosions, fires or mechanical breakdowns affecting or caused by PSE's facilities or infrastructure may increase the Company's costs, impact PSE's generation, transmission and distribution systems, subject the Company to increased liability, and/or adversely affect its operations; 
 Risks due to health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, including supply shortages, rising costs, disruption to vendor or customer relationships, the potential for reputational harm, the impact of government, business and company closure of facilities, customer or contract defaults, concerns of safety to employees and customers, potential costs due to quarantining of employees and work-from-home policies, and the Company's and vendor staffing levels resulting from vaccination mandates; and 
 Legislative, regulatory, code, and/or ordinance changes that impact operations, electric and natural gas availability, sales, transmission, delivery, and/or restrictions. 
 
 40 

Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs 
 PSE's regulatory requirements, environmental compliance and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2023 and future years. As PSE intends to seek recovery of these investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon outcomes from that process. The rates PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission. Prior to 2023, the Washington Commission required that rates be determined based on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions. Incremental customer growth and sales typically did not provide sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases due to regulatory lag and attrition. Therefore, the Company would seek rate relief through rate cases with the Washington Commission, which would determine whether the Company's expenses and capital investments were reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost-effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determined that a capital investment was not reasonable or prudent, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such capital investment would be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates. 
 Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE s mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as variable power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism. The Washington Commission and Washington state law also set natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE. The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on the natural gas business's financial performance due to the natural gas business being mostly decoupled. 
 In May 2021, the Washington Governor signed legislation passed by the state legislature that requires investor-owned utilities to file a forward looking multi-year rate plan (MYRP) for two, three, or four years as part of a GRC filed with the Washington Commission on or after January 1, 2022. For the initial rate year, the legislation requires the Washington Commission to ascertain and determine the fair value for rate-making purposes of the property in service as of the date that rates go into effect. Under the law, while utilities are required to file a MYRP (at least two years in length) the Washington Commission is not required to approve them. To the extent the Washington Commission approves a MYRP, utilities are bound to the first and second year of the MYRP but may file for a new rate plan in years three or four. If a company earns greater than a half percent above its authorized rate of return on a regulated basis, revenues above that level must be deferred for refunds to customers or another determination by the Washington Commission in a subsequent adjudicative proceeding. The Washington Commission must also set performance measurements to assess a natural gas or electric company operating under a MYRP. 
 
 General Rate Case Filing 
 PSE filed a GRC which includes a two year MYRP with the Washington Commission on February 15, 2024, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 6.7 and 19.0 respectively in rate year one (expected to approximate calendar year 2025) and 8.5 and 2.1 , respectively in rate year two (expected to approximate calendar year 2026). PSE requested a return on equity of 9.95 for the first rate year beginning in 2025 and 10.5 for the second rate year beginning in 2026. PSE requested an overall rate of return of 7.65 in 2025 and 7.99 in 2026. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2024 as required by RCW 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2026, the final year of the MYRP. The next phase of the filing will be to establish a procedural calendar for the adjudication of the case. The Company estimates the agreed upon rates from this proceeding will become effective by statute approximately 11 months after filings. 
 On December 22, 2022, the Washington Commission issued an order on PSE s 2022 GRC that approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.16 , or 6.62 after-tax, a capital structure of 49.0 in common equity and a return on equity of 9.4 . On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s natural gas rates with an overall net revenue change of 70.8 million or 6.4 in 2023 and 19.5 million or 1.7 in 2024, with an effective date of January 7, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s electric rates with an overall net revenue change of 247.0 million or 10.8 in 2023 and 33.1 million or 1.3 in 2024 with an effective date of January 11, 2023. For additional information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Climate Commitment Act Deferral 
 On December 29, 2022, PSE filed accounting petitions with the Washington Commission requesting authorization to defer costs and revenues associated with the Company s compliance with the CCA codified in law within Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70A.65. On February 28, 2023, in Order 01 under Docket No. UE-220974 and UG-220975, the Washington Commission granted PSE approval to defer the cost of emission allowances to comply with the CCA and the proceeds from no-cost allowances consigned to auction beginning January 1, 2023. As such, PSE concluded it was appropriate to defer and seek recovery of CCA costs not currently included in rates. As of December 31, 2023, PSE deferred 184.4 
 41 

million of CCA compliance costs for natural gas and electric liabilities and recorded 83.0 million related to the proceeds from the sale of consigned GHG emission allowances. 
 On August 3, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for CCA rates in Docket No. UG-230470, subject to refund, effective October 1, 2023, to recover the estimated ongoing allowance costs and proportionate pass back of credits to customers from estimated auction proceeds during the period of August 2023 through December 2023. Overall, the proposal included a new revenue requirement of 104.7 million related to the Washington state carbon reduction charge, mitigated by a new revenue requirement decrease of 87.9 million related to the Washington state carbon reduction credit. 
 On October 26, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for CCA rates in Docket No. UG-230756, subject to refund, effective November 1, 2023, to recover the estimated ongoing allowance costs and proportionate pass back of credits to customers from estimated auction proceeds during the period of January 2023 through September 2023. The recovery of ongoing allowance costs and pass back of credits is consistent with the approved accounting petitions in Dockets No. UG-220975 and UG-230471. As part of this filing PSE requested an annual revenue increase of 27.2 million. 
 For further details, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the natural gas 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing, the annual gas delivery allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The Washington Commission approved removing the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 7, 2023. 
 On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the electric 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing, the annual electric delivery and fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The Washington Commission approved removing the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 11, 2023. 
 On December 31, 2023, PSE performed an analysis to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980. If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE is required to record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and regulatory asset balance. Once the reserve is probable of collection within 24 months from the end of the annual period, the reserve can be recognized as decoupling revenue. The analysis indicated that electric and natural gas deferred revenue would be collected within 24 months of the annual period; therefore, no reserve adjustment was booked to 2023 electric or natural gas decoupling revenue. 
 The Washington Commission approved the following PSE requests to change rates for prior deferrals under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms:

 1. For electric and natural gas rates effective May 1, 2023, May 1, 2022, and May 1, 2021, there were no excess earnings that impacted the approved revenue change. 
 2. For the electric rates effective May 1, 2022, there was 8.0 million of excess deferred revenues for delivery and fixed power costs which could not be set in rates until May 1, 2023, due to the 3 rate cap. 
 3. For the electric rates effective May 1, 2021, there was 24.1 million of excess deferred revenues for delivery and fixed power costs which could not be set in rates until May 1, 2022, due to the 3 rate cap.

 1. Per UG-230740, the tariff was effective October 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023 and would recover costs and pass back credits from August 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. 

Access to Debt Capital 
 PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy. Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to refinance existing or issue new long-term debt, obtain access to new or renew existing credit facilities, could increase the cost of issuing long-term debt and maintaining credit facilities, and could impact the Company's ability to pay dividends. For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees. If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or generating capacity acquisitions, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected. PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs. For additional information, see "Financing Program" included in Item 7 of this report. 
 44 

Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures 
 PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contaminated sites and the environmental impacts of siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend significant resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees. 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the CCA, which establishes a greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions cap-and-invest program that requires covered entities to purchase allowances to cover their GHG emissions with a cap on available allowances beginning on January 1, 2023 that declines annually through 2050. The Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) published final regulations to implement the program on September 29, 2022, which became effective on October 30, 2022. The WDOE also indicated that it will have subsequent rulemakings building off initial rulemaking while program implementation is underway and progress with Washington carbon goals are evaluated. See Part I, Item 1. "Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation" in this report for further details on the CCA. 
 While the Washington Commission has approved the recovery of natural gas CCA-related costs, which has led to increases in costs to customers, it has indicated these revenues are subject-to-refund, and there is a risk PSE may ultimately not be able to recover all costs. Electric CCA-related costs have not yet been approved for recovery at this time and it is uncertain what obligation may be borne by customers or at risk for recovery. PSE faces continued risks associated with the program, including the evolving nature of the CCA rulemaking and related interpretation of the rules, unresolved recovery methodology for CCA s impact on energy costs, company costs, customer rate impacts, and cash, liquidity and credit volatility. 
 Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 

Other Challenges and Strategies 
 Competition 
 PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural and regulated monopoly. However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities or efforts by citizens organizing to form such entities that want to establish their own government-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers. PSE also faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers through alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods. In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE. 

Results of Operations 
 Puget Sound Energy 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document. The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Electric and Natural Gas Margins 
 The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a presentation that is not defined by GAAP. The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance. Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers in order to provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns. PSE s electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and natural gas margin measures. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. 
 
 45 

The following table presents operating income and a reconciliation of utility electric and natural gas margins to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income: 
 Puget Sound Energy (Dollars in Thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Operating income (loss) 335,452 792,462 Electric utility revenue 3,345,867 2,961,457 Purchased electricity (1,110,572) (1,038,728) Electric generation fuel (457,287) (348,159) Residential exchange 77,223 77,715 Utility electric margin (non-GAAP) 1,855,231 1,652,285 Natural gas operating revenue 1,424,368 1,209,636 Purchased natural gas (641,371) (500,849) Utility natural gas margin (non-GAAP) 782,997 708,787 Other revenue 16,383 45,080 Unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (284,495) 261,177 Other operation and maintenance expenses (735,278) (665,259) Non-utility expense and other (28,658) (47,194) Depreciation and amortization (865,969) (774,291) Taxes other than income tax expense (404,759) (388,123) Operating income (loss) 335,452 792,462

Electric Margin 
 Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory. 
 The following chart displays the changes in PSE s electric margin for the years ended December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023: 
 
 _______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 2022 compared to 2023 
 Electric Operating Revenue 
 Electric operating revenues increased 384.4 million primarily due to increased retail sales of 231.8 million, sales to other utilities and marketers of 172.8 million, other decoupling revenue of 28.7 million and decoupling revenue of 1.8 million, which were partially offset by a decrease in transportation and other revenue of 50.8 million. These items are discussed in detail below: 
 Electric retail sale s increased 231.8 million due to an increase of 283.6 million in rates compared to the prior year, partially offset by a decrease of 51.8 million from a decrease in retail electricity usage of 2.1 . The increase in rates is primarily due to the tariffs filed pursuant to the Company's most recent GRC effective January 11, 2023. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 7 of this report for electric rate changes. The decrease in retail usage was due to a decrease in residential, commercial and industrial usage of 3.1 , 0.5 and 3.9 , respectively. Customer usage decreased due to a decrease in heating and cooling degree days of 8.5 and 6.0 , respectively, in 2023 as compared to 2022. 
 Sales to other utilities and marketers increased 172.8 million primarily due to a 103.2 increase in wholesale sale volumes due to increased volume from PSE natural gas-fired generation, which increased 72.5 in 2023 compared to 2022. Lower natural gas fuel prices made natural gas-fired generation more economic to dispatch in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in electric wholesale sales price of 24.9 . 
 47 

Decoupling revenue increased 1.8 million, attributable to a 13.5 million decrease and a 15.3 million increase in delivery and fixed production cost (FPC) deferral revenues, respectively. The decrease in delivery deferral revenue was primarily driven by increased actual rates, whereas the increase in FPC deferral revenue was primarily driven by decreased usage. 
 Other decoupling revenue increased 28.7 million, primarily due to changes in amortization rates. For the year ended December 31, 2023, prior year overcollection deferrals from residential customers were amortized at a higher rate compared to the same period in 2022. A higher percentage of amortization related to prior year overcollection results in more revenue recognized in the current period. This was partially offset by a 3.0 million decrease related to GAAP alternative revenue program recognition guidelines. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 3.0 million of deferred 2021 GAAP alternative decoupling revenues that were recognized. There were no such revenues recognized in 2023. 
 Transportation and other revenue decreased 50.8 million primarily due to a 63.5 million decrease in net wholesale non-core natural gas sales and a 2.5 million energy charge credit recovery adjustment approved in the 2022 GRC, which was partially offset by an increase of 16.8 million due to the IRS Private Letter Ruling in 2022, which included amortization to offset recovery through rates in 2022. The decrease in wholesale non-core natural gas sales was primarily driven by a decrease of 56.6 million in financial hedging gains in 2023 compared to 2022 due to a decrease in natural gas prices. Additionally, net wholesale non-core natural gas sales decreased 6.9 million which was primarily driven by a 34.1 decrease in both the average price of natural gas sales and purchases in 2023 compared to 2022. 
 
 Electric Power Costs 
 Electric power costs increased 181.4 million primarily due to an increase of 71.8 million of purchased electricity costs and 109.1 million of electric generation fuel costs. These items are discussed in detail below: 
 Purchased electricity expense increased 71.8 million primarily due to increased wholesale purchase prices, which were 11.9 higher in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by open market purchases as well as two winter peaking power purchase agreements that began after September 2022, a power purchase agreement for energy produced at the Puget Sound Refinery Cogeneration Facility that began after July 2023, and the Clearwater Wind Project that began commercial operations in November 2022. The increase from wholesale purchase prices were partially offset by a 4.4 decrease in wholesale electricity purchases. 
 Electric generation fuel expense increased 109.1 million primarily due to a 106.4 million increase in natural gas fuel costs as a result of a 72.5 increase in PSE natural gas-fired generation as discussed in sales to other utilities and marketers above. Higher costs from increased production were partially offset by lower natural gas prices which drove a 20.8 decrease in average unit production costs. 
 
 48 

Natural Gas Margin 
 Natural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory. The PGA mechanism passes through increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates to customers based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs. PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over- and under- recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded or collected from customers, respectively, in future periods. 
 The following chart displays the changes in PSE s natural gas margin for the years ended December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023: 
 
 _______________ 
 Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve. 
 
 2022 compared to 2023 
 Natural Gas Operating Revenue 
 Natural gas operating revenue increased 214.7 million primarily due to higher retail sales of 165.0 million, decoupling revenue of 27.1 million, other decoupling revenue of 12.2 million and transportation and other revenue of 10.4 million. These items are discussed in the following details: 
 Natural gas retail sales increased 165.0 million due to an increase in rates of 233.9 million partially offset by a decrease in natural gas load of 5.6 or 68.8 million of natural gas sales. The increase in rates is due to the tariffs filed pursuant to the Company's PGA and GRC effective November 1, 2022 and January 7, 2023, respectively, and was partially offset by a decrease in the Company's most recent PGA rates effective November 2023. See "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes. The decrease in load is driven by a decrease of commercial and residential usage of 3.3 and 7.0 , respectively. Customer usage decreased due to a decrease in heating degree days of 8.5 in 2023 as compared to 2022. 
 49 

Decoupling revenue increased 27.1 million, primarily due to decreased natural gas usage, as mentioned above, in 2023 compared to 2022, which was caused by higher average temperatures. 
 Other decoupling revenue increased 12.2 million due to increased amortization rates for prior year overcollection deferrals and decreased amortization rates for undercollection deferrals compared to the same period in 2022. A higher percentage of amortization related to prior year overcollection resulted in more revenue recognized in the current period. 
 Transportation and other revenue increased 10.4 million primarily due to an increase in transportation revenue of 8.3 million and 3.1 million related to the IRS PLR which included amortization of the PLR to offset recovery through rates in 2022. 
 
 Natural Gas Energy Costs 
 Purchased natural gas expense increased 140.5 million primarily due to an increase in the PGA rates in November 2022 and was partially offset by a decrease in the PGA rates in November 2023 and a decrease in natural gas usage of 5.6 as stated in the natural gas retail sales section above.

Other Operating Expenses and Other Income (Deductions) 
 The following chart displays the details of PSE's other operating expenses and other income (deductions) for the years ended December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023: 

2022 compared to 2023 
 Other Operating Expenses 
 Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments changed 545.7 million to a net loss of 284.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary driver was the change in the weighted average forward prices for electric and natural gas. Specifically, the change in electric weighted average forward price decreased 156.4 , which resulted in 280.0 million in loss for electric, as well as net settlement of electric trades that were previously recorded as 48.2 million in gain. Natural gas prices decreased 85.1 resulting in 328.2 million loss for natural gas. These losses were partially offset by the natural gas trades previously recorded as 110.6 million in loss. 
 Utility Operations and Maintenance expense increased 70.0 million primarily due to increases in the following: (i) 10.7 million related to transportation electrification and CEIP trackers; (ii) 9.5 million in customer service expense due to increased low-income assistance; (iii) 9.4 million in outside consulting fees related to corporate strategic planning; (iv) 7.1 million related to higher administration expenses related to customer collections and records processing; (v) 6.6 million in pension related expenses; (vi) 5.6 million related to increased steam generation maintenance expenses related to boilers and other equipment; (vii) 5.2 million of administrative and general expenses related to the CEIP and other strategic projects; (viii) 4.1 million related to injuries and damages expense; and (ix) 4.0 million related to higher distribution operations expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 7.4 million of maintenance related natural gas-fired electric generating equipment. 
 Non-utility and other expense decreased 18.4 million primarily due to a decrease of 22.1 million related to biogas purchase expense, driven by a decrease in both volume of biogas purchased and average biogas purchase price. 
 51 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased 91.7 million primarily driven by (i) 41.0 million increase in electric amortization from 2022 primarily driven by 21.9 million less Lower Snake River treasury grant amortization credits in 2023 compared to 2022, 12.1 million addition of 2022 storm cost amortized in 2023, and 6.8 million in Get to Zero (GTZ) electric tranche amortization; (ii) 27.1 million increase in natural gas distribution depreciation from 2022 primarily due to 188.6 million in net additions in natural gas distribution assets; (iii) 11.0 million increase in electric distribution depreciation from 2022 primarily due to 279.8 million in net additions of electric distribution assets; (iv) 10.7 million increase in electric production depreciation from 2022 primarily due to 51.1 million in net additions of electric production assets; (v) 6.4 million increase in natural gas amortization from 2022 primarily driven by a 3.6 million increase in GTZ natural gas tranche amortization; and (vi) 4.4 million increase in conservation amortization due to conservation rider rates effective May 1, 2023, see "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in this Item 7 of this report. These increases were partially offset by: (i) 5.2 million decrease in electric general plant and other depreciation from 2022 primarily driven by a 5.1 million decrease in asset retirement costs in 2023 compared to 2022 and (ii) 2.7 million decrease in common general plant from 2022, driven by the timing of retirements during 2023, which were offset by additions in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Taxes other than income taxes increased 16.6 million primarily due to an increase of 14.7 million related to municipal taxes driven by the increase in retail revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022 and 11.6 million related to the state excise tax. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 7.7 million in property taxes. 
 
 Other Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense 
 Other income/expense increased 32.4 million from net other income of 17.1 million in 2022 to 49.5 million in 2023, due to an increase of 27.5 million in other income and a decrease of 4.8 million in other expense. The increase was primarily driven by the following increases: (i) 13.0 million in taxable interest and dividend income due to an increase in PCA customer interest and interest earned on short-term investments of excess cash; (ii) 10.2 million in AFUDC due to an increase in eligible construction work in progress; (iii) 6.6 million in the non-service cost component of the qualified pension net periodic benefit cost for 2023 compared to 2022; (iv) 3.2 million in other expense related to a 2022 write-off of the Colstrip dry ash facilities; and (v) 2.2 million in gain on corporate life insurance policies. These increases in other income and other expense were partially offset by a decrease of 2.3 million in AMI due to a change in AMI return deferral per the 2022 GRC. 
 Interest expense increased 22.1 million primarily due to (i) 13.5 million increase in interest expense due to the May 2023 PSE bond issuance; (ii) 9.2 million increase related to interest expense recognized on the PGA liability; and (iii) 3.5 million increase in interest expense recognized in conjunction with PSE's deferred compensation liability. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 3.3 million in monetized PTC interest expense. 
 Income tax expense decreased 86.9 million primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax book income.

Puget Energy 
 Substantially all the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, PSE. Puget Energy s results of operation for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, were as follows: 
 
 2022 compared to 2023 
 Summary Results of Operations 
 Puget Energy s net income decreased by 360.6 million, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in PSE's net income of 359.9 million and a decrease in other operating revenue and income of 7.3 million due to a decrease in pension non-service cost of 6.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 4.6 million driven by a decrease of 8.2 million on a senior note that retired in 2022, a decrease of 9.3 million due to Puget LNG interest expense, which is eliminated during consolidation, an increase in interest expense of 9.3 million related to the revolving credit agreement and an increase of 2.9 million due to a senior note issued in 2022.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition. The Company does have standby letter of credit arrangements. For more information, see Note 8 Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Utility Construction Program 
 The Company s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system, the natural gas and electric distribution systems and the Tacoma LNG facility are designed to meet regulatory requirements, support customer growth and to improve energy system reliability. The Company's capital expenditures were 381.0 million higher than forecasted amounts for 2023. The increase was primarily due to (i) new generation resource acquisition, higher natural gas construction and electric first response, and unplanned thermal maintenance; (ii) pull-forward of cable remediation work, Tono and Buckley substation work, and Sammamish-Juanita transmission line project, and (iii) delayed Energize Eastside and Smart Grid projects. Construction expenditures, excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC), totaled 1.5 billion in 2023. 
 
 54 

Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows: 
 
 Capital Expenditure Projections (Dollars in Millions) 2024 2025 2026 Total energy delivery, technology and facilities expenditures 1,716.0 1,936.4 2,231.7 
 
 The program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions. Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources, which may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity. PSE s planned capital expenditures may result in a level of spending that will exceed its cash flow from operations. As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to capital markets.

 Year Ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022 
 Cash generated from operations increased by 273.6 million despite a decrease in net income of 359.9 million. The following are significant factors that impacted PSE's cash flows from operations: 
 Cash flow adjustments resulting from non-cash items increased 513.8 million, primarily due to: (i) a 545.7 million change from a net unrealized gain on derivative instruments of 261.2 million to a net unrealized loss on derivative instruments of 284.5 million, (ii) an increase in depreciation and amortization of 87.3 million, (iii) increased conservation amortization of 4.4 million and (iv) a deferral of return and depreciation expenses for PSE's share of Tacoma LNG investment of 4.2 million. The increases were partially offset by: (i) a decrease in deferred taxes of 118.3 million and (ii) a decrease in equity AFUDC of 10.7 million. For further discussion, see "Other Operating Expenses" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis. 
 Cash flows resulting from changes in working capital decreased 110.2 million primarily due to: (i) accounts payable decreased faster than the same period last year that led to increased cash outflows of 469.3 million, (ii) higher prepayment balances of 37.6 million, (iii) higher balances in materials and supplies increased cash outflows of 22.4 million, (iv) increased cash outflow of 7.7 million related to the timing of transmission deposits, (v) an increased cash outflow of 11.1 million related to higher incentive payments and (vi) higher Washington Commission annual filing fees of 6.0 million. The decreases were partially offset by: (i) cash inflows of 389.0 million in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue as the balance decreased 136.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to an increase of 252.3 million during the same period of 2022; (ii) lower balances in 
 55 

fuel and natural gas inventory led to cash inflow of 39.7 million, and (iii) an increase of 3.2 million due to a higher tax payable balance. 
 Cash flows resulting from regulatory assets and liabilities increased 243.4 million primarily due to: (i) 181.4 million cash proceeds received from the sale of consigned GHG emission allowances, which is required to be returned to customers and (ii) 96.4 million of cash inflow from power cost adjustment receivable, which was due to actual power costs being lower than baseline rates in 2023, whereas actual power costs were higher than baseline rates in 2022. The increases were partially offset by: (i) a 21.0 million decrease in cash flows related to the amortization of IRS PLR deferred balances and (ii) 6.7 million decrease in cash flow caused by greater accrual of bad debt deferral related to COVID-19 in 2023 compared to 2022. 
 Cash flow resulting from purchased gas adjustment increased 115.5 million, which was mainly driven by a decrease in actual natural gas costs and an increase in allowed PGA recovery in 2023 compared to 2022. Decreased natural gas prices led to a 62.4 million, or 13.6 , decrease in actual natural gas costs in 2023 compared to 2022. Meanwhile, the total amount of allowed PGA recovery in 2023 increased 25.0 million, or 5.0 , compared to 2022. In addition, there was a 28.1 million refund (including interest) from a counterparty settlement received in January 2023. 
 Cash flow resulting from GHG emission allowances decreased 129.2 million, which was driven by obtaining Washington emission allowances for GHG emissions associated with the Company's electric and natural gas business activities in compliance with the CCA.

 Year Ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022 
 Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, in addition to the changes discussed at PSE above, increased by 10.2 million compared to the same period in 2022, which includes a net income decrease of 0.7 million. The remaining change was primarily impacted by the factors explained below: 
 Changes in cash flow resulting from non-cash items increased 6.1 million, primarily due to higher non-cash inflows of 5.5 million related to changes in deferred taxes. 
 Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital decreased 2.0 million primarily due to: (i) a 8.4 million increase of cash outflows due to the change in PSE's intercompany accounts receivable and account payable balances with Puget LNG and Puget Energy, which are eliminated upon consolidation of Puget Energy and (ii) a 5.4 million cash outflow due to changes in tax payable. The decreases were partially offset by: (i) a cash inflow of 5.9 million driven by reduction of accrued interest expense as result of lower interest rates on debt, as Puget Energy issued 450.0 million of senior secured notes at an interest rate of 4.224 in March 2022 and repaid 450.0 million of 5.625 notes in April 2022, (ii) a cash inflow of 4.3 million due to balance changes in account receivable related to Puget LNG and (iii) lower balances in fuel and natural gas inventory specific to Puget LNG led to a cash inflow of 1.5 million. 
 Changes in other non-current assets and liabilities increased 6.8 million mainly due to a 3.7 million cash inflow related to nonrecurring fees incurred in 2022 associated with the Puget Energy credit facility that was entered into in May 2022.

Financing Program 
 The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt. Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months. 
 Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility operating and construction programs. Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets. 
 As of December 31, 2023, both Puget Energy and PSE have stable outlooks from Moody s, Fitch, and S P. Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt whose maturity would be accelerated upon a ratings downgrade, management continually monitors the credit rating environment for both Puget Energy and PSE as a credit rating downgrade may increase the cost of borrowing for Puget Energy and PSE in future long-term financings or under their existing credit facilities. Any increase in the cost of borrowing could negatively impact Puget Energy and PSE's future results of operations as well as future liquidity, access to debt capital resources and financial condition. Additionally, a ratings downgrade could impact the Company's ability to issue dividends. A downgrade to Puget Energy and PSE's credit ratings would not impact debt covenants under our existing credit facilities nor would it impact other contracts, as neither include credit rating triggering event clauses. A credit rating decrease for PSE could result in increased cash collateral required for commodity contracts, which would adversely affect PSE's liquidity. Management cannot predict with certainty the actions credit agencies may take, if any, in response to weaker near term credit metrics, regulatory and rate recovery uncertainties, and management's efforts to contain the growth of capital and operating expenditures. Containing the growth of capital and operating expenditures will be limited, over the near term, due to continuing strategic and risk mitigation imperatives and the necessity of providing safe, reliable and resilient service levels to customers. 
 For information on Puget Energy and PSE dividends, long-term debt including S-3 shelf registrations, and credit facilities, see Note 5, Dividend Payment Restrictions", Note 7, Long-term Debt and Note 8, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Debt Restrictive Covenants 
 The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. 
 PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2023, PSE could issue: 
 Approximately 1.6 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s electric mortgage indenture based on approximately 2.6 billion of electric bondable property available for issuance, subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the electric utility mortgage), which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2023; and 
 Approximately 1.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately 1.8 billion of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2023. 
 At December 31, 2023, PSE had approximately 9.3 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Management believes the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue. PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading 
 57 

system. The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month. The "current" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer. 
 Certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency. Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or a regulatory liability for over recovery. Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism. 
 As defined by ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors. PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism. Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted, the additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the Washington Commission that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized. PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded. 
 For further discussion regarding revenue recognition, see Note 3, "Revenue", to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Regulatory Accounting 
 As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980. The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries. The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC. Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2023, in the amount of 1,212.0 million and 1,914.9 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022, of 896.4 million and 1,961.1 million, respectively. Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings. PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements. 
 Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms. The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission. The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale. For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs" included in Item 7 of this report. The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customer bills through the PGA mechanism. PSE expects to fully recover/refund these regulatory balances through its rates. However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis. 
 
 Derivatives 
 ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception. The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps. Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules. Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business. Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the Western Interconnection to allow for physical delivery of the energy. PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts. Those contracts that do not meet the 
 58 

NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income. Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism. 
 PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service. The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter. When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves. All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis. The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios. PSE is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions. 
 For additional information, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," Note 10, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Environmental Remediation 
 The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. A potentially responsible party has joint and several liability under existing U.S. environmental laws. In instances where we have been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agency, we are potentially liable for the cost of remediating contamination at current work sites and former work sites. Such sites include former manufactured gas plants operated by PSE predecessors, such as Gas Works Park on the shore of Lake Union in Seattle, and contaminated facilities with other connections to PSE predecessors, such as the location of a long-defunct creosote manufacturer which had purchased waste products from PSE predecessors (e.g. Quendall Terminals site on Lake Washington in Renton, Washington). In each case, PSE assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our environmental remediation obligations related to the contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. PSE develops a range of reasonably estimable costs that includes a low and high end of a range for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded based on the best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites. It s possible that costs are incurred in excess of the recorded amounts because of changes in laws and/or regulations, the solvency of other liable parties higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties and/or from customers under a Washington Commission order. 
 For additional information see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Fair Value 
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in this report.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE. PSE recognized qualified pension expense of 0.3 million and 14.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately 46.6 and 48.3 were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of 2.4 million and 8.7 million, respectively. In 2024, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension income of 5.6 million and incremental qualified pension income of 2.6 million, respectively. 
 PSE has a SERP and other limited postretirement benefit plans, for which expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial for both PSE and PE. Further, PSE and PE expect to recognize immaterial expenses in 2024 related to the SERP and other limited postretirement benefit plans. 
 The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets and is applied consistently from year to year. During 2023, the Company made cash contributions of 18.0 million to the qualified defined pension plan. Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company s qualified pension plan was 136.9 million overfunded and 69.3 million overfunded as measured under GAAP, or 121.0 and 111.8 funded, respectively. As of January 1, 2024, the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100 . The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2024, are expected to be at least 18.0 million, 2.0 million and 0.2 million, respectively. 
 The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 5.60 in 2022 to 5.30 in 2023. The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense increased from 3.00 in 2022 to 5.60 in 2023. The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits increased from 6.50 in 2022 to 6.75 in 2023. The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits was 7.00 in both 2022 and 2023.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Energy Portfolio Management 
 PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage risks inherent to participating in wholesale energy markets that may have related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity. The nature of operating generation and distribution facilities, obtaining transmission service, securing fuel and other necessary services, and energy market participation generally is such that there is continuous exposure to various risks including market, asset reliability, operational, liquidity, model, and counterparty credit risk. PSE s Energy Risk Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures, and is responsible for reviewing risk tolerances and limits, establishing delegations of authority, maintaining systemic and procedural adequacy of control system, and monitoring compliance. The Energy Risk Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors annually approves the Company s energy risk policies and procedures which includes a review of established risk tolerances and limits for the energy supply portfolio. 
 When managing the electric and natural gas portfolios, PSE's primary objectives are to: (1) minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability, (2) ensure physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer-loads, while (3) limiting undesired impacts or portfolio risks, and (4) optimizing the capacity value of energy supply assets. It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading. PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices. 
 PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools, including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric, price and unit performance conditions. Based on the analytics from all of its models and tools, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity options to manage its electric and natural gas portfolio risks. The forward physical electric and natural gas contracts are both fixed and variable (at index). To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (derivative) contracts. PSE also utilizes natural gas options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations while also allowing for participation in low price commodity markets.

The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments, recorded on the balance sheets: 
 
 Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in Thousands) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Electric portfolio: Current 62,929 107,195 267,811 79,668 Long-term 30,099 19,744 69,892 7,452 Total Electric Portfolio 93,028 126,939 337,703 87,120 Natural gas portfolio: Current 11,296 78,593 319,218 45,308 Long-term 5,225 18,305 24,729 10,914 Total Natural Gas Portfolio 16,521 96,898 343,947 56,222 Total derivatives 109,549 223,837 681,650 143,342 
 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had total assets of 109.5 million and total liabilities of 223.8 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of electricity and natural gas to serve PSE customers. As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism. Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers. As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism. 
 A hypothetical 10.0 increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by 45.9 million. 
 
 The change in fair value of the Company's outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2022, through December 31, 2023, is summarized in the table below: 
 Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy Energy Derivative Contracts Gain (Loss) (Dollars in Thousands) December 31, 2023 Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 538,308 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during 2023 (339,224) Change in fair value of derivatives (313,372) Fair value of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 (114,288) 
 
 The fair value of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2023, based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:

For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Note 10, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 
 Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk 
 PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement. PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure. 
 PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties. PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts in the electric industry; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical natural gas contracts. PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default. It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss. In order to mitigate concentrated credit risk with a subset of counterparties, PSE enters into cleared transactions on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) for power futures contracts and ICE NGX for natural gas supply contracts. 
 Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses. Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure. As of December 31, 2023, PSE held approximately 787.0 million in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees and had seven counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions. The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 81.2 of the Company's total energy portfolio exposure was entered into with investment grade counterparties which, in the majority of cases, do not require collateral calls on the contracts. Counterparty credit risk may impact PSE's decisions on derivative accounting treatment. 
 Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts. Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements. PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements. The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty. The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves. The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default. The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate. The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals. The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals by counterparty and arriving at an average value. The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels. 
 The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position. The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate. Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the period. The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. PSE also transacts power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and natural gas contracts on the ICE NGX platform. Execution of contracts on ICE requires the daily posting of margin calls as collateral through a futures and clearing agent. As of December 31, 2023, PSE had cash posted as collateral of 12.4 million related to contracts executed on the ICE platform. As a condition of transacting on the ICE NGX platform as well as participating in the Washington state carbon allowance auctions, PSE maintains a standby letter of credit agreement with TD Bank. As of December 31, 2023, PSE had no cash posted with ICE NGX, and 51.0 million was issued under the standby letter of credit agreement in support of natural gas and carbon allowance purchases. PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 63 

Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable-rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements. The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities. The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs. Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable. 
 The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's long-term debt instruments: 
 Long-Term Debt Instruments December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Dollars in Thousands) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Puget Energy 7,036,642 6,855,503 6,663,373 6,184,097 Puget Sound Energy 5,184,047 5,007,483 4,786,765 4,379,010 
 
 For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Note 7, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 11, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance. The ending balance in other comprehensive income (OCI) related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2023, was a net loss of 3.8 million after-tax and accumulated amortization. This compares to an after-tax loss of 4.2 million in OCI as of December 31, 2022. All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution. PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap instruments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Puget Energy, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedules, of Puget Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 67 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded 1,218.2 million of regulatory assets and 1,962.4 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2023. Management accounts for the Company s regulated operations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) accounting guidance for regulated operations, which requires deferral of certain costs or losses that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs. The FASB s accounting guidance for regulated operations similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future. This accounting is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. As disclosed by management, the regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be fully recovered through the Company s rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, management would be required to write off the regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if management determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of the FASB s accounting guidance for regulated operations, management could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting the FASB s requirements. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company s accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter is the high degree of effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the continued application of regulatory accounting and accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s assessment of the continued application of regulatory accounting and management s review and application of regulatory proceedings. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the reasonableness of management s judgments regarding the continued application of regulatory accounting and the probability of recovery of the capital investments and regulatory assets and settlement of regulatory liabilities; (ii) testing existing regulatory assets and liabilities and; (iii) assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Evaluating the continued application of regulatory accounting and the accounting for new and existing regulatory assets and liabilities involved examining the Company s correspondence with regulators, pending regulatory proceedings, and the provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders to assess the impact on the amounts recognized.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule, of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 69 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Accounting for the Effects of Regulatory Matters 
 
 As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded 1,212.0 million of regulatory assets and 1,914.9 million of regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2023. Management accounts for the Company s regulated operations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s (FASB) accounting guidance for regulated operations, which requires deferral of certain costs or losses that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs. The FASB s accounting guidance for regulated operations similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future. This accounting is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers. As disclosed by management, the regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be fully recovered through the Company s rates. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, management would be required to write off the regulatory assets and liabilities. In addition, if management determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of the FASB s accounting guidance for regulated operations, management could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting the FASB s requirements. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Company s accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter is the high degree of effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the continued application of regulatory accounting and accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities.

 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region. Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which has the sole purpose of owning and operating the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. PSE and Puget LNG are considered related parties with similar ownership by Puget Energy. Therefore, capital and operating costs that are incurred by PSE and allocated to Puget LNG are related party transactions by nature. 
 In 2009, Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings), owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger). As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings. The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger. ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date. 
 The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiaries. PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company . The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions. PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and do not include any ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) purchase accounting adjustments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 material related party transactions during the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 . 
 
 Tacoma LNG Facility 
 In February 2022, the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma completed commissioning and commenced commercial operations. In December 2019, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) issued the air quality permit for the facility, and the Pollution Hearings Control Board of Washington State upheld the approval following extended litigation. The Tacoma LNG facility provides peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and provides LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market at a lower cost due to the facility's scale. 
 Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE will be allocated approximately of common capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility. The remaining of common capital and operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility will be allocated to Puget LNG. Per this allocation of costs, million and million of non-utility plant related to Puget LNG's portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the Puget Energy "Other property and investments" financial statement line item as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Additionally, million, million, and million of operating costs are reported in the Puget Energy "Non-utility expense and other" financial statement line item in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Further, million and million of plant in service related to PSE s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the PSE Utility plant - Natural gas plant financial statement line item as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, as PSE is a regulated entity.

. For further details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
 Puget Energy recorded regulatory assets and liabilities at the time of the merger related to power purchase contracts. 
 
 Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances 
 PSE is required to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with electricity it generates or imports into Washington and natural gas supplied to customers in accordance with the cap-and-invest program included in the Climate Commitment Act (CCA). PSE records allocated and purchased emission allowances at cost, similar to an inventory method, and includes purchased emissions allowances in current assets and long-term assets reported in the "GHG emission allowances" line item on the consolidated balance sheets. PSE measures the compliance obligation at the weighted average cost of allowances held plus the fair value of additional allowances required to satisfy the obligation after adjustment for applicable no-cost allowances received. PSE includes the obligation in current liabilities and long-term liabilities reported in the "Compliance obligations" line item on the consolidated balance sheets based on the dates the allowances are to be surrendered. Consistent with ASC 980, PSE defers costs and revenues associated with the cap-and-invest program through regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 effective October 1, 2020 for natural gas and October 15, 2020 for electric. Per the 2022 GRC, the AFUDC rate authorized is effective January 7, 2023 for natural gas and January 11, 2023 for electric. 
 To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income. The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately years. 
 
 million, million and million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
 PSE's electric and natural gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism. The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue and gross margin erosion due to weather and energy efficiency. Any differences in revenue are deferred to a regulatory asset for under 
 85 

for natural gas customers and for electric customers. The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized. Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recognized amounts will be recognized. Revenues associated with energy costs under the power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanism are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.

of operation. Before the 2017 GRC, the tax savings from these credits were intended to be refunded by PSE to its customers when monetized, used on the income tax return, through its revenue requirement as initially approved by the Washington Commission. As the Company had not generated taxable income with which to monetize the credits, they had not been refunded to customers. Amounts to be refunded have been recorded as a regulatory liability with an offsetting reduction to revenue as it was intended to be refunded through the revenue requirement. A deferred tax asset and reduction to deferred tax expense were also recorded for the regulatory liability. These entries resulted in no net income impact. In connection with the GRC settlement in 2017, the Washington Commission authorized the Company to utilize the tax savings associated with the monetization of the PTCs to fund the following: (i) Colstrip Community Transition Fund, (ii) unrecovered Colstrip plant and (iii) incurred decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip. As PTCs will no longer be refunded to customers through the revenue requirement, a non-cash increase to revenue and deferred tax expense will be recorded as the PTCs are monetized. These entries will result in no net income impact. There was PTC monetized in the tax years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For the tax year ended December 31, 2021, million of PTCs were monetized through tax filings.

years. Skookumchuck commenced commercial operation in November 2020. In May 2020, PSE entered into a PPA with Golden Hills Wind Farm, LLC (Golden Hills) pursuant to which Golden Hills would develop a wind generation facility and sell bundled energy and associated attributes, namely RECs, to PSE over a term of years. On April 29, 2022, Golden Hills commenced commercial operations. In February 2021, PSE entered into a PPA with Clearwater Wind Project, LLC (Clearwater) in which Clearwater would develop a wind generation facility and sell energy and associated attributes to PSE over a term of years. On November 8, 2022, Clearwater commenced commercial operations. For each of the aforementioned PPAs, PSE has equity investment in the generation facilities, but is the only customer of each facility. PSE has concluded that Skookumchuck, Golden Hills, and Clearwater represent variable interest entities (VIE) and that PSE is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since it does not control the commercial and operating activities of the facilities. Additionally, PSE does not have the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits. As a result, PSE does not consolidate the VIEs. 
 million and million were recognized in purchased electricity on the Company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Additionally, million and million were included in accounts payable on the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

 Revenue at PSE is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract or tariff with our customers are satisfied. Performance obligations are satisfied generally through performance of PSE's obligation over time or with transfer of control of electric power, natural gas, and other revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods and services. 
 
 Electric and Natural Gas Retail Revenue 
 Electric and natural gas retail revenue consists of tariff-based sales of electricity and natural gas to PSE's customers. For tariff contracts, PSE has elected the portfolio approach practical expedient model to apply the revenue from contracts with customers to groups of contracts. The Company determined that the portfolio approach will not differ from considering each contract or performance obligation separately. Electric and natural gas tariff contracts include the performance obligation of standing ready to perform electric and natural gas services. The electricity and natural gas the customer chooses to consume is considered an option and is recognized over time using the output method when the customer simultaneously consumes the electricity or natural gas. PSE has elected the right to invoice practical expedient for unbilled retail revenue. The obligation of standing ready to perform electric service and the consumption of electricity and natural gas at market value implies a right to consideration for performance completed to date. The Company believes that tariff prices approved by the Washington Commission represent stand-alone selling prices for the performance obligations under ASC 606. PSE collects Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes and presents the taxes on a gross basis, as PSE is the taxpayer for those excise and municipal taxes. 
 
 Other Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 Other revenue from contracts with customers is primarily comprised of electric transmission, natural gas transportation, biogas, and wholesale revenue sold on an intra-month basis. 
 
 Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Transportation 
 Transmission and transportation tariff contracts include the performance obligation to transmit and transport electricity or natural gas. Transfer of control and recognition of revenue occurs over time as the customer simultaneously receives the transmission and transportation services. Measurement of satisfaction of this performance obligation is determined using the output method. Similar to retail revenue, the Company utilizes the right to invoice practical expedient as PSE s right to consideration is tied directly to the value of power and natural gas transmitted and transported each month. The price is based on the tariff rates that were approved by the Washington Commission or the FERC and, therefore, corresponds directly to the value to the customer for performance completed to date.

million of other revenue from contracts with customers. PWI purchases, develops, and sells land holdings throughout PSE s service territory; thus, the sale was reported as non-utility revenue of million and non-utility expense of million. 
 
 Other Revenue 
 In accordance with ASC 606, PSE separately presents revenue not collected from contracts with customers that falls under other accounting guidance. 
 
 Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations 
 In December 2020, PLNG entered into a contract with one customer where PLNG is selling LNG over a -year delivery period beginning no later than 2024. The contract requires the customer to purchase a minimum annual quantity even if the customer does not take delivery. The price of the LNG includes a fixed charge, a fuel charge that includes both a market index and fixed margin component and other variable consideration. The fixed transaction price is allocated to the remaining performance obligations which is determined by the fixed charge components multiplied by the outstanding minimum annual quantity.

 (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805. 
 
 If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements. Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO), PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability million and million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant. These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates. 
 
 General Rate Case Filing 
 PSE filed a GRC which includes a two year multiyear rate plan (MYRP) with the Washington Commission on February 15, 2024, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of and respectively in rate year one (expected to approximate calendar year 2025) and and , respectively in rate year two (expected to approximate calendar year 2026). PSE requested a return on equity of for the first rate year beginning in 2025 and for the second rate year beginning in 2026. PSE requested an overall rate of return of in rate year one and in rate year two. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2024 as required by RCW 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2026, the final year of the MYRP. The next phase of the filing will be to establish a procedural calendar for the adjudication of the case. The Company estimates the agreed upon rates from this proceeding will become effective by statute approximately 11 months after filings. 
 On December 22, 2022, the Washington Commission issued an order on PSE s 2022 general rate case (GRC), which was filed on January 31, 2022, that approved a weighted cost of capital of , or after-tax, a capital structure of in common equity in 2023 and 2024, and a return on equity of . On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s natural gas rates in its compliance filing with an overall net revenue change of million or in 2023 and million or in 2024, with an effective date of January 7, 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE s electric rates in its compliance filing with an overall net revenue change of million or in 2023 and million or in 2024 with an effective date of January 11, 2023. Per the 2022 GRC Final Order in Docket No. UE-220066, rates approved in PSE's power cost only rate case (PCORC) in Docket No. UE-200980 were set to as of January 11, 2023, and PSE agreed not to file a PCORC during 2023 and 2024, the period covered by the -year rate plan agreed to in the GRC settlement. 
 Prior rates were subject to the 2019 GRC and included a weighted cost of capital of or after-tax, and a capital structure of in common equity with a return on equity of . The annualized overall rate impacts were an electric revenue increase of million, or , and a natural gas increase of million, or , effective October 1, 2021. For further information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Company's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022.

million of CCA compliance costs for natural gas and electric liabilities. Additionally, PSE will consign for auction at least the minimum amount of no-cost emission allowances allocated for natural gas operations in compliance with the CCA, the proceeds of which will be used for the benefit of natural gas customers, as determined by the Washington Commission. PSE will not record a regulatory liability to defer the proceeds until consigned allowances are sold at auction. As of December 31, 2023, PSE recorded million related to the proceeds from the sale of consigned GHG emission allowances. 
 In October 2022, the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) published final regulations to implement the cap and invest program. The WDOE also indicated that it will have subsequent rulemakings building off initial rulemaking as program implementation is underway and progress with Washington State carbon goals are evaluated. One component of the CCA rules stipulates the WDOE shall provide qualifying electric utilities, such as PSE, with no-cost allowances based on the cost burden of the program to electric customers, which is derived using a forecast of emissions. An additional component of the CCA rules stipulates that the allocation of no-cost allowances may be adjusted once a year under a "true-up mechanism" which takes into account the cumulative total of no-cost allowances issued to an electric utility relative to the electric utility's reported GHG emissions. Such adjustments will be made in the fourth quarter of the following year, at which time WDOE could add allowances to an electric utility's account if such account has an allowance deficit, or withhold future allocated allowances going forward if such account had previously allocated excess allowances. WDOE has not provided further guidance or rules specifying how such adjustments will be determined. As a result, the Company cannot predict the impact of such adjustments. 
 WDOE provided an initial allocation of no-cost allowances to electric utilities on April 24, 2023. However, qualifying electric utilities were allowed to submit revised emissions forecasts approved by the Washington Commission to WDOE by July 30, 2023. PSE filed its revised forecast of 2023 emission under Docket No. UE 220797, which was approved by the Washington Commission on July 27, 2023, and approved by the WDOE on September 27, 2023. Accordingly, the Company's compliance obligation as of December 31, 2023, reflects the revised allowance allocation. 
 Following the September 27, 2023 WDOE decision, PSE's no-cost allowance allocation will be set for 2023 until the fourth quarter of 2024 when there is an opportunity to request a "true-up" of no-cost allowances under the aforementioned adjustment mechanism. However, as of December 31, 2023, due to the uncertainty around implementation of the adjustment mechanism PSE did not adjust the CCA electric compliance obligation anticipating an adjustment to no cost allowances to reported 2023 electric GHG emissions and does not plan to make such adjustment until a formal true-up allocation has been granted by the WDOE. 
 
 Revenue Decoupling Adjustment Mechanism 
 In June 2021, the Washington Commission approved the multi-party settlement agreement, which was filed within PSE s PCORC filing. As part of this settlement agreement, the electric annual fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement and took effect on July 1, 2021. 
 In September 2021, the Washington Commission approved the 2019 GRC filing. As part of this filing, the annual electric and natural gas delivery cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. The changes took effect on October 1, 2021. 
 On January 6, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the natural gas 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing, the annual natural gas delivery allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue requirement. Additionally, the Commission approved the removal of the earnings test from the decoupling mechanism in accordance with RCW 80.28.425(6). The changes took effect on January 7, 2023. 
 On January 10, 2023, the Washington Commission approved the electric 2022 GRC filing. As part of this filing, the annual electric delivery and fixed power cost allowed revenue was updated to reflect changes in the approved revenue

reserve adjustment was recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism 
 PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs. The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
 Over or under collected between 17 million - 40 million 
 
 Over or under collected beyond 40 million 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, in its PCA mechanism, PSE over recovered its allowable costs by million of which million was apportioned to customers and million of interest was accrued on the deferred customer balance. This compares to an under recovery of allowable costs of million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, of which million was apportioned to customers and accrued million of interest on the total deferred customer balance. 
 
 Power Cost Adjustment Clause 
 PSE exceeded the million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2022. During 2022, actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs, thereby, creating an under-recovery of million. Under the terms of the PCA s sharing mechanism for under-recovered power costs, PSE absorbed million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining million, or million, including interest and adjusted for revenue sensitive items. On April 28, 2023, PSE filed the 2022 PCA report under Docket No. UE-230313 that proposed a recovery of the deferred balance, which included a revenue requirement increase of in overall bill for all customers, with rates proposed to go into effect from December 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024. 
 PSE also exceeded the million cumulative deferral balance in its PCA mechanism in 2021, as actual power costs were higher than baseline power costs, thereby creating an under-recovery of million. PSE absorbed million of the under-recovered amount, and customers were responsible for the remaining million, or million, including interest. In October 2022, the Washington Commission approved PSE's 2021 PCA report that proposes to recover the deferred balance for 2021 PCA period by keeping the current rates and allowing recovery from January 1, 2023 through November 30, 2023. 
 On September 29, 2023, PSE filed its variable power cost rates update as part of the 2022 GRC Order requirement under Docket No. UE-220066. The filing was approved in part on December 22, 2023, with updated rates effective January 1, 2024. 
 
 Purchased Gas Adjustment Mechanism 
 In October 2021, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-210721, effective November 1, 2021. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue increase of million, where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, increase annual revenue by million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106, decrease annual revenue by million. Those annual 2021 PGA rate increases were set in addition to continuing the collection on the remaining balance of million under Supplemental Schedule 106B, which were set, in effect, through September 30, 2023, per the 2019 GRC. 
 In October 2022, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-220715, effective November 1, 2022. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue increase of million, where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, increase annual revenue by million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106, increase annual revenue by million. 
 96 

million related to PSE natural gas services which was recorded on December 31, 2022, and included below. The 2022 GRC order requires PSE to amortize the refund in 2023 as a credit against natural gas costs and therefore pass back the refund to customers through the PGA mechanism. 
 On October 26, 2023, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request for PGA rates in Docket No. UG-230769, effective November 1, 2023. As part of that filing, PSE requested an annual revenue decrease of million, where PGA rates, under Schedule 101, decrease annual revenue by million, and the tracker rates under Schedule 106, decrease annual revenue by million. The annual 2023 PGA rate decreases include the aforementioned counterparty settlement pass back of million under Supplemental Schedule 106B.)

 Storm Loss Deferral Mechanism 
 The Washington Commission has defined deferrable weather-related events and provided that costs in excess of the annual cost threshold may be deferred for qualifying damage costs that meet the modified Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers outage criteria for system average interruption duration index. For the year ended December 31, 2023, PSE incurred million in weather-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which the Company deferred and million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This compares to million incurred in weather-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, of which the Company deferred million and million as regulatory assets related to storms that occurred in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Under the 2017 GRC Order, the storm loss deferral mechanism approved the following: (i) the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms under the mechanism at million; and (ii) qualifying events where the total qualifying cost is less than million will not qualify for deferral and these costs will also not count toward the million annual cost threshold. 

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations. The Company has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the WDOE and/or other third parties as potentially responsible or liable at several contaminated sites, including former manufactured gas plant sites. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 450 Contingencies , the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly basis. The adjustments recorded are based on the best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred by the Company based on its currently understood legal exposure at applicable sites. It is reasonably possible that incurred costs exceed the recorded amounts due to changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs due to changes in labor market or supply chain, evolving technology, unforeseen and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. The Company currently estimates that a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties, and/or from customers under a Washington Commission order. The Company is subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and Bellingham, Washington. As of December 31, 2023, the Company s share of future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately million.

Additionally, PSE had a million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract. 
 
 Demand Promissory Note 
 In May 2023, PSE amended and restated its revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a demand promissory note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy. Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest based on Puget Energy s credit facility interest rate, which is SOFR plus SOFR adjustment, plus spread over the adjusted SOFR rate. As of December 31, 2023, there was outstanding balance under the promissory note. 
 
 Puget Energy 
 Credit Facility 
 In May 2022, Puget Energy entered into a new million credit facility to replace the existing facility. The terms and conditions, including fees, financial covenant, expansion feature and credit spreads remain substantially the same. The base interest rate on loans has changed to the SOFR, as the LIBOR was discontinued on June 30, 2023. The proceeds of the Puget Energy credit facility are to be used for general corporate purposes. The maturity date of the credit facility is May 14, 2027. The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature, upon receipt of commitments from one or more lenders, could increase the size of the facility up to billion. 
 The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow based on a prime based rate or SOFR, in either case, plus a spread based on Puget Energy's credit ratings. Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility. As of the date of this report, interest was calculated as SOFR plus SOFR adjustment plus spread over the adjusted SOFR rate and the commitment fee was . As of December 31, 2023, Puget Energy had million in short-term debt, drawn and outstanding under its credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, Puget Energy had million drawn and outstanding under its credit facility, of which million was classified as long-term debt and million was classified as short-term debt. 
 The revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The credit agreement also contains a leverage ratio that requires the ratio of (a) total funded indebtedness to (b) total capitalization to be or less at all times. As of December 31, 2023, Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 In September 2022, Puget Energy borrowed million on its credit facility and contributed the proceeds to PSE as an equity contribution. The equity proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In August 2023, Puget Energy borrowed million on its credit facility and contributed the proceeds to PSE as an equity contribution. The equity proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

 . PSE's hedging strategy includes a risk-responsive component for the core natural gas portfolio, which utilizes quantitative risk-based measures with defined objectives to balance both portfolio risk and hedge costs. 
 PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools. In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options. Currently, the Company does not apply cash flow hedge accounting, and therefore records all mark-to-market gains or losses through earnings. 
 The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities. The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs. The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.

 3. All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations, due to the PGA mechanism. The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers. 
 Electric portfolio derivatives consist of electric generation fuel of million One Million British Thermal Units (MMBtus) and purchased electricity of million megawatt hours (MWhs) at December 31, 2023, and million MMBtus and million MWhs at December 31, 2022. 
 
 It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level without offsetting assets or liabilities. The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements, which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements, which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements, which standardize physical natural gas contracts. The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as the right of set-off in the event of counterparty default. The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.

 The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers. Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement. The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, and exposure monitoring and mitigation. 
 The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default swap rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress. Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses. Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure. 
 It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties. If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss. However, as of December 31, 2023, approximately of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) transactions, is with counterparties that are rated investment grade by rating agencies and are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies. The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated by the major rating agencies. 
 The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty. The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors in the determination of reserves, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads. The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default. The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate. The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals. The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value. The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels. 
 The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position. The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate. Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the period. The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. PSE also transacts power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and natural gas contracts on the ICE NGX exchange platform. Execution of contracts on ICE requires the daily posting of margin calls as collateral through a futures and clearing agent. As of December 31, 2023, PSE had cash posted as collateral of million related to contracts executed on the ICE platform. As a condition of transacting on the ICE NGX platform as well as participating in the Washington state carbon allowance auctions, PSE maintains a standby letter of credit agreement with TD Bank. As of December 31, 2023, PSE had cash posted with ICE NGX, and million was issued under the standby letter of credit agreement in support of natural gas and carbon allowance purchases. PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

 Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled. Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income. 
 In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes. To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3. The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions. Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa. The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month

 The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted. Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power. As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets. At December 31, 2023, a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by million. 
 
 Long-Lived Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Puget Energy records the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360). The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk. Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation. The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle. 
 ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power. 
 Puget Energy evaluated the triggering event criteria in ASC 360 during 2023 and 2022 and determined there was indication of impairment of its power purchase contracts.

smoothing of asset gains (losses) measured from the expected return on market-related assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year. 
 Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality trends. Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation. Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors. As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger. 
 The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from the FTSE Pension Discount Curve (formerly known as the Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve). The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities. The Company's projected benefit obligation for pension plans experienced an actuarial loss of million in 2023. This is primarily due to the change of census data, which increases the expected benefit obligation.

 Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements. 
 The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk. All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented. 
 The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established. Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.

 The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years. ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Puget Energy s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2031 through 2037. Net operating losses generated in 2018 and thereafter have no expiration date. valuation allowance has been provided for net operating loss carryforwards.

PSE has accelerated the depreciation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4 to December 31, 2025 as part of the 2019 GRC. The 2017 GRC repurposed PTCs and hydro-related treasury grants to recover unrecovered plant costs and to fund and recover decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip Units 1 through 4.

 of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately per Kilowatt Hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River. The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project, in proportion to the contractual share of power that PSE obtains from that project. In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered. These projects are financed substantially through debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements. The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.

Legal Matters 
 Washington Climate Commitment Act 
 In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the CCA, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that requires covered entities, including electric and natural gas utilities, to purchase allowances to cover their GHG emissions with a cap on available allowances beginning on January 1, 2023 that declines annually through 2050. WDOE published final regulations to implement the program on September 29, 2022, which became effective on October 30, 2022. WDOE also indicated that there will be subsequent rulemakings building off initial rulemaking as program implementation proceeds and Washington carbon goals is evaluated. 
 One component of the CCA rules stipulates that GHG emissions associated with exported electricity are covered emissions and require an allowance offset to the extent these exports are not sourced from a non-emitting resource. Another component of the CCA rules stipulates GHG emissions associated with imported electricity are covered emissions and require an allowance offset for the first jurisdictional deliverer serving as the electricity importer for that electricity. Per RCW 70A.65.010(42)(d), imported electricity does not include electricity imports of unspecified electricity that are netted by exports of unspecified electricity to any jurisdiction not covered by a linked program by the same entity within the same hour. Under this definition, hourly power transmission data is required to determine PSE s net imported electricity compliance obligation. Although the Company is actively engaged in determining the hourly net generation, imports and exports, the methodology for netting these components by hour that will be required by the WDOE to calculate the compliance obligation is uncertain, and PSE expects further rulemaking and agency interpretations to clarify this uncertainty in future periods. Due to the estimation uncertainty as of the date of this disclosure, the company considered a range of outcomes depending on the proportion of exported electricity that is sourced from non-emitting resources and whether all unspecified electricity imports and exports fully net on an hourly basis, none net, or a portion do. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's estimated the range of possible outcomes to be between and million depending on the methodology applied in netting unspecified electricity imports and exports. Since no amount in the range represents a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrued to the minimum amount in the range. As existing uncertainties are resolved in future periods, any change in compliance costs as a result of such estimated additional liabilities would be deferred under ASC 980 as a regulatory asset consistent with Docket No. UE-220974, as these amounts may be recoverable from customers in future utility rates.

 Mary E. Kipp, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO);

 This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides to its Named Executive Officers who are employees. Mr. Doyle is not an employee and does not participate in the programs listed below. Mr. Doyle's compensation is described in the Other Compensation section below. 
 
 Compensation Program Objectives 
 The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives: 
 Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business. 
 Align incentive compensation payments with the achievement of short and long-term Company goals. 
 
 136 

The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives. In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of the executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian). The Committee recommends to the Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Meridian and other relevant factors described below, and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO. The Committee also recommends to the Board for approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of target and actual awards under those plans, based on the compensation information provided by Meridian and other relevant factors. 
 
 In 2023, the Company used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program: 
 Design and deliver a competitive total compensation opportunity. To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Company believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with companies of similar size, revenue, industry and scope of operations. As described below in the discussion of Role of Market Data, the Committee, with the support of Meridian, annually compares executive compensation levels to external market data from similar companies in our industry and generally targets each element of target total direct compensation (base salary and target annual and long-term incentive award opportunities) to the 50th percentile of the market data with variations by individual executive, as appropriate. The Company also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income. As such, the Committee reviews our retirement programs and provides benefits that are competitive with our peers. 
 Place a significant portion of each executive s target incentive compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance. Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Company maintains an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business strategy and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers. The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and earned based on achievement relative to annual and long-term performance goals. For example, 83 of the target 2023 compensation of our CEO, Ms. Kipp, was considered at risk compensation. By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company seeks to focus executives on actions that will improve Company performance and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent. The Committee annually evaluates and establishes the performance goals and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs, which are approved by the Board. 
 Oversee the Company s talent management process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes. The CEO leads talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team. Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company. Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans. The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.

 The target total compensation package is designed to provide executives with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator groups described below and motivate the achievement of current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value. The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive awards consistently comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay. 
 As a matter of philosophy, all three components of target total direct compensation are generally targeted within a competitive range of the 50th percentile of industry practice, recognizing that the Company operates in a highly competitive regional market. Individual executive pay position may vary from the 50th percentile as influenced by the factors below. Actual executive compensation depends significantly on Company performance results, and can result in below or above targeted levels. 
 Individual pay adjustments are reviewed annually relative to the 50th percentile of national peer market pay, while also considering other factors, such as the executive s recent performance, experience level, company performance, competitive pay in our region, retention of top talent and internal pay equity. Notwithstanding the median philosophy, the Company may choose to target an executive s compensation above or below the 50th percentile of national peer market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job, in response to regional market pressures, or when our executive s experience differs from that typically found in the market.

Role of Market Data 
 The Company uses market data compiled by Meridian to inform its pay decisions on base salary, target annual incentives and target long-term incentive awards. Market data is obtained from both industry-specific surveys and proxy statements of public companies selected for inclusion in the Company s custom executive compensation peer group. The market survey data were sourced from a select cut from the Willis Towers Watson 2022 Energy Services Survey, comprised of utility and other companies similar in size and scope of operations to PSE. 
 
 The 26 companies in the custom market survey cut for 2023 pay decisions are the same as those used for the 2022 pay decisions and are shown below:

The market survey data from the companies above were supplemented with proxy statement data for select positions in the Company s executive compensation peer group, which was comprised of 17 companies, all but one of which overlapped with the companies included in the market survey data. At the time of the benchmarking study, the median revenue of the executive compensation peers was 4.0 billion, which was comparable to PSE s annual revenues of 4.2 billion. The proxy peer group was reviewed by Meridian to assess the continued relevancy of the companies and based on their analysis recommended two companies to be added to the group.

 Compensation Program Elements 
 The Company s executive compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites. Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of fixed and variable cash-based compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives. 
 
 Base Salary 
 We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of regularly paid compensation that provides a balance to other at-risk pay elements. Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee based on its compensation philosophy, internal pay equity considerations and considerations specific to an individual such as an executive s expertise, level of performance, experience in the role and contribution relative to others in the organization. 
 
 Base Salary Adjustments for 2023 
 The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2023 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board, except for Mr. August, whose salary was approved at hire in July 2023 and Mr. Doyle, whose 
 138 

compensation is described below under Other Compensation. The Board approved the Committee s salary recommendations as shown in the table below. The adjustments were effective March 1, 2023. Base salaries for 2023 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.

 2023 Annual Incentive Compensation 
 All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Doyle), are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan . The plan is designed to incent our employees to achieve both (i) desired annual financial results, measured by EBITDA, calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and (ii) pre-established goals based on both a service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure. EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance. 
 For 2023, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against nine Service Quality Indicators (SQIs) covering three broad categories, set forth below. These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission. The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results. The Company s service quality report cards are available at www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards. 
 The SQIs for 2023 were the same as those in 2022 and were as follows: 
 Customer Satisfaction (3 SQIs) - Customer satisfaction with the customer care center, natural gas field services and number of Washington Commission complaints. 
 Customer Service (1 SQI) - Calls answered live within 60 seconds by the customer care center. 
 Operations Services (5 SQIs) - Gas emergency response, electric emergency response, non-storm outage duration as measured by the System Average Interruption Disruption Index (SAIDI), non-storm outage frequency, and on-time appointments. 
 
 The employee safety performance measure reflects the Company s continued commitment to employee safety. The safety performance measure contains three targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met. The three employee safety targets for 2023 were: 
 All employees view a monthly PSE People safety video, featuring employees from across PSE discussing their jobs and efforts to ensure the health and safety of themselves, their coworkers and our customers. The target completion rate is no less than 95 . 
 Use of the hazard reporting system. To raise awareness of hazards in all areas of the Company (office, home or field), employees will use the hazard reporting system. The target is a 10 increase of submissions from the 2022 baseline number. 
 All employees complete an online mental health training course, consisting of four videos during 2023. The target completion rate is no less than 95 . 
 Annual incentive funding is decreased if a SQI is not achieved. The employee safety measure functions similarly to the nine SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan. That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10 , in the same way as a missed SQI. 
 In 2023, 100 funding for the annual incentive plan required (i) achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all nine SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and (ii) target EBITDA performance. Nine of the ten customer service and safety measures were met. For the one SQI measure not met, System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), the Board considered the measure met for incentive purposes based on PSE s overall strong performance and the noteworthy progress achieved at improving reliability. EBITDA finished at 98.3 of target, so funding was less than 100 , as described further below. 
 139 

2023 Annual Incentive Plan Results 
 For 2023, achievement of the corporate goals under the annual incentive plan was at 98.3 of target for EBITDA. PSE EBITDA was 1,487.6 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 10 out of 10, met or deemed met, leading to a funding level for 2023 of 91.4 for the annual incentive plan for the eligible Named Executive Officers. 
 
 Funding levels for 2023 at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below: Annual Incentive Performance Payout Scale and Actual Performance Performance Measure (Dollars in Millions)

 _______________ 
 Combined SQI and Safety results of 6/10 or better and minimum EBITDA of 1,326.6 million are required for any annual incentive plan funding 
 SQI and Safety results below 10/10 reduce funding (e.g., 9/10=90 , 8/10=80 , 7/10=70 
 
 No bonus is earned unless at least the threshold EBITDA and SQI and safety goals are achieved. The achievement of threshold performance results in a 30 of target bonus payout. The maximum incentive payable for exceptional performance is two times each Named Executive Officer's target incentive. Executives generally must be employed on the last day of the calendar year to receive a payment, except in the event of retirement, disability or death. 
 An executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on an assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results. After considering performance on individual and team goals, adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of certain Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2023. The adjustments for individual performance are noted in the "Bonus" column of the Summary Compensation table and did not materially change the amounts resulting from 2023 achievement of the corporate goals. The Board approved the incentive amounts shown below, which will be paid in March 2024:

 ______________ 
 Mr. August s annual incentive is prorated for time worked in 2023 since his hire. His target annual incentive is 65 of base salary. Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith were not employed at December 31, 2023 and as a result, were not eligible for a 2023 annual incentive payment. Mr. Doyle did not participate in the annual incentive plan. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
 Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to align the interests of executives with those of our investors, provide competitive pay opportunities, support a customer-focused utility, reward long-term performance and promote retention. Long term incentive plan (LTI Plan) grants are denominated and paid in cash, if at least threshold performance measures are met over a three-year performance cycle. Long term incentive performance measures can vary for each performance cycle. 
 Long-term incentive payments for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 cycles are based on achievement of a Return on Equity (ROE) metric, subject to achievement of a threshold EBITDA goal. Under this goal, EBITDA during the applicable three-year 
 140 

performance cycle must meet or exceed 90 of target EBITDA for a payment to occur. Assuming the EBITDA threshold is met, the grant cycles are funded based on the three-year average ROE metric. ROE reflects the income earned on our equity investment. 
 For the 2023-2025 cycle, the long term incentive program is based on three measures that are evaluated separately: 
 An environmental measure (carbon intensity) with a 10 weighting; 
 Strategic Initiatives with an overall 35 weighting; and 
 Total Return with a 55 weighting. 
 The 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 LTI Plan payments ultimately paid may range from 0 to 200 of target, depending on performance; while the 2023-2025 LTI Plan payments may range from 0 to 173 of target, depending on performance. 
 The Committee recommends for Board approval a targeted LTI grant value in dollars for each executive. The targeted LTI grant value is determined by evaluating LTI grant values provided to similarly situated executives at comparable companies (using the previously discussed survey and peer group data) as well as other relevant executive-specific factors. The Company generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when making new LTI Plan grants. 
 Executives generally must be employed on the last day of the performance cycle to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement, disability or death. 
 
 2023-2025 Long-Term Incentive Plan Target Awards 
 Consistent with prior years, target LTI Plan awards for the 2023-2025 performance cycle were denominated in dollars, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company and the corresponding market data. Ms. Kipp s target LTI Plan grant was increased to 3,875,000 to align with market pay levels. Target LTI Plan award amounts for the 2023-2025 performance cycle are shown in the following table: 
 Name

 Mary E. Kipp 3,875,000

Details of the target grants and expected values at target, threshold and maximum performance levels can be found in the 2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance 2021-2023 Performance Cycle Results and Payouts 
 The 2021-2023 performance cycle has now ended. Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the following table: 
 The threshold EBITDA goal of 3,902.9 million was satisfied for the performance cycle. Performance on the ROE component of the grant finished at 6.59 , which was 91.2 of target, above the plan s threshold for funding, but below target, which would have resulted in funding of 64.7 of target. The Committee recommended and the Board approved a payment of 105 of target funding level, in recognition of the Company s significant progress on clean energy objectives and other achievements that contribute toward the long term value of the company, resulting in the payment of the following LTI Plan amounts:

 1 Target LTI Plan incentive is the dollar target level set in 2021. 
 2 In connection with Mr. August's commencement of employment in 2023, he was eligible to participate in the 2021-2023 performance cycle at a target amount that reflected reduced participation during the performance cycle but was intended to incentivize performance following commencement of employment. Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith forfeited their 2021-2023 LTI Plan grants upon termination of their employment in 2023. 
 
 Retirement Plans 
 The Company maintains executive retirement plans to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan). Without the addition of the executive retirement plans, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees. All the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Doyle) participated in the executive retirement plan, which is the Officer Restoration Benefit as part of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees during 2023. Additional information regarding the Officer Restoration Benefit and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2023 Pension Benefits table. 
 
 Deferred Compensation Plan 
 The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan). The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100 of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices. The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly. The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation. The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans. Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2023 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table. 
 
 Post-Termination Benefits 
 The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the peer group companies. Based on this information, the Committee has determined not to extend such arrangements to current and newly hired executives. No executive officers have employment agreements that would provide severance benefits. Certain compensation programs, such as the LTI Plan, have provisions that would apply in the event of a change in control. 
 142 

The Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Other Compensation 
 The Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites. To attract qualified candidates, the Company may provide certain payments to executives in connection with an offer of employment, including payments to offset their relocation expenses. 
 In reviewing recent market target compensation for the CEO position, and actual performance of the Company over the period 2021-2023, the Committee identified a gap in actual pay for Ms. Kipp compared to market and recommended an additional payment, which the Board approved for 2023 in the amount of 1,593,000. 
 Mr. Doyle, who previously retired as Senior Vice President and CFO from the Company in 2021, is CFO on a contract basis, beginning September 26, 2023. Mr. Doyle will be paid 750,000 for the duration of his time as CFO during 2023 and 2024, as well as housing expenses. 
 In connection with his offer of employment, Mr. August was eligible to receive a signing bonus of 390,000 and a relocation payment of 175,000, grossed up for taxes, to assist with moving expenses. Both amounts must be repaid if Mr. August resigns or is terminated for cause within 24 months of employment. Subject to continued employment, Mr. August is eligible to receive a retention bonus of 250,000 in March 2024. In addition to participation in the 2021-2023 performance cycle under the LTI Plan, Mr. August is also eligible to participate in the 2022-2024 performance cycle based on a target grant value of 393,750 and in the 2023-2025 performance cycle for which disclosure is provided above. 
 The eligible Named Executive Officers participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees. Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits. The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services up to an annual limit. The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities. These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and did not exceed 10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2023. Executives are taxed on the value of the perquisites received, with no corresponding gross-up by the Company. 
 
 Relationship among Compensation Elements 
 A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements. Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value opportunities for annual incentives, because the plan operates with a target award set as a percentage of base salary. Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments. Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay. Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits. 
 
 Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy 
 The Board adopted an Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy, effective October 2, 2023, that is intended to comply with Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and NYSE listing standards. The policy applies to current and former executive officers of the Company as defined in Rule 10D-1, including the Named Executive Officers, and will be administered by the Committee. In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement to correct material noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws, it is the Company s policy to recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by its executive officers in accordance with the terms of the policy. 
 
 Impact of Accounting and Tax Treatment of Compensation 
 The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a significant factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers. However, the Company considers the tax impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive. As a result of changes in federal tax law effective in 2018, the Company is now subject to IRS Section 162(m). Section 162(m) limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, to 1 million per year. Notwithstanding the new tax law, the Company does not expect to make changes in its executive compensation program designs and retains the discretion to pay compensation that may not qualify for a tax deduction. 
 
 143 

Risk Assessment 
 A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for the achievement of Company goals. The Company s variable pay program helps executives focus on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results. In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective Company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board. As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers. 
 
 Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report 
 The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program. Each member of the Committee served during all of 2023, except Ms. Hamm who joined May 11, 2023.

 _______________ 
 1. Reflects individual performance above target as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," section titled "2023 Annual Incentive Plan Results" for Ms. Kipp. For Mr. Hasan reflects a retention bonus of 250,000 paid in 2023 in connection with the terms of his 2021 offer of employment.. For Mr. August reflects a signing bonus paid in connection with commencement of employment in 2023. For Mr. Roberts reflects a retention bonus paid in 2023. For Mr. Smith reflects retention bonuses paid in connection with commencement of employment in 2022, in the amounts of 630,000 and 150,000. 
 2. For 2023, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2023 Goals and Incentive Plan and cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2021-2023 performance cycle. Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2024 or deferred at the executive's election. The 2023 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2024. 
 3. Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year. The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts that the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested. In 2023, updated interest rates relative to those used for 2022 have generally resulted in smaller increases in value than in prior years. Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2023 Pension Benefits. The change in pension value amounts for 2023 are: Ms. Kipp, 0; Mr. August, 0; Ms. Luebbe, 5,269; and Mr. Roberts, 11,062. Mr. Doyle retired from the company in 2021 and is not accruing any additional pension benefits. 
 4. All Other Compensation for 2023 is shown in detail in the table below. 
 5. Ms. Kipp joined PSE and Puget Energy as President on August 31, 2019, and became President and CEO on January 3, 2020.

 _______________ 
 1. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2023 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2023 of 1,362.6 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/10. Payment would be 0 if either trigger is not met. The threshold estimate assumes 1,362.6 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 6/10. The target estimate assumes 1,514.0 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10. The maximum estimate assumes 2,043.0 million EBITDA or higher and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10. The award for Mr. August was pro-rated for time worked in 2023 per the plan. 
 2. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants for the 2023-2025 performance cycle were allocated to three measures. The environmental measure (10 weighting) funds at 100 if met; the Strategic Initiatives measure (35 weighting) funds at 50 at threshold, 100 at target and 150 at maximum; the Total Return measure (55 weighting) funds at 50 at threshold, 100 at target and 200 at maximum. The performance measures are evaluated independently, but if each finished at threshold, target and maximum, the overall funding levels would be 55 , 100 , and 173 , respectively. 
 3. In connection with Mr. August s commencement of employment, he was eligible to participate in the LTI Plan for the performance cycle indicated, but at a reduced participation level, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis.".

2023 Pension Benefits 
 The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP, in addition to an Officer Restoration Benefit as part of the Deferred Compensation Plan. None of the named executives are eligible for the SERP plan. The following table provides information for the participating Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the Officer Restoration Benefit. The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements. Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans, except Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. August, who participate just in the Officer Restoration Benefit (which is reported separately below). Mr. Hasan was paid the Officer Restoration Benefit amount with his deferred compensation balance upon termination. Mr. Smith had not vested in their retirement benefits prior to leaving the Company and any previously reported unvested amounts were forfeited.

_______________ 
 1. The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases. Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination. The values under the Retirement Plan are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2023, of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan). Future cash balance interest credits are assumed to be 4.0 annually. The discount assumption is 5.30 , and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2024 417(e) unisex mortality table. Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 3.62 , 4.46 , and 4.52 (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2023), except that payments assumed to occur during 2024 use segment rates in effect for 2024 (this does not apply to any Named Executive Officers this year). These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2023. In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2022, for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2022. These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0 , a discount assumption of 5.60 and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2023 417(e) unisex mortality table. Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.41 , 3.09 , and 3.58 (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2022). Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2022, were the same as those used for December 31, 2023. 
 2. None of the Named Executive Officers have SERP benefits as that plan was closed prior to their joining PSE. Ms. Kipp, Mr. Hasan and Mr. August do not have a Retirement Plan benefit, as upon hire, each elected to have their 4 company retirement contribution made to their 401(k) accounts. Based on service through December 31, 2023 these 401(k) accounts had values of: Ms. Kipp, 49,930 and Mr. Hasan, 23,637. Mr. August s account will reflect balances in 2024. All of the Named Executive Officers also participate in the Officer Restoration Benefit Plan as described below, with vesting after three years of service. The value of these Officer Restoration accounts based on service through December 31, 2023 are: Ms. Kipp, 138,898; Ms. Luebbe, 1,168; and Mr. Roberts, 10,044. Mr. August's first Officer Restoration account contribution will be made in 2024.

Retirement Plan 
 Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 (prior to December 12, 2014, in the case of IBEW-represented employees), including the participating Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997. Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant. The pay credits range from 3 to 8 of eligible compensation. Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, will receive pay credits equal to 4 (rather than the age-based pay credit described above), which non-represented and IBEW-represented employees may choose to have contributed to the Company s 401(k) plan, rather than credited under the Retirement Plan. Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2023, the limit was 330,000. For 2024, the limit is 345,000. In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997, was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula. Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest. The interest crediting rate is 4 per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine. For 2023 and 2024, the annual interest crediting rate was 4 . 
 A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates. Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65 (employees designated as casual employees by PSE and who have reached age 65 or employees who have applied for long-term disability and have reached age 65 may commence benefits without terminating employment). However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates. If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time. This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction. The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30 for each of the first 60 months, 0.33 for each of the second 60 months, 0.23 for each of the third 60 months and 0.17 for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday. Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday. As of December 31, 2023, all the Named Executive Officers, eligible for the Retirement Plan, except Mr. Smith, were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination. Ms. Kipp and Mr. August are not eligible for the Retirement Plan, as each elected at employment to have the Company s 4 retirement contribution made to the Company s 401(k) plan. Prior to leaving the Company, Mr. Hasan was not eligible for the Retirement Plan and Mr. Smith had not vested in his benefits under the Retirement Plan and, accordingly, forfeited those benefits upon termination. 
 The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits. The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution. For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50 survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50 of the amount being paid to the participant. Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity. In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants. All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity. However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency). 
 If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies). If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
 The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan. The Company closed the SERP plan to new participants as of August 1, 2019. None of the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP 
 
 Officer Restoration Benefit 
 The Officer Restoration Benefit provides a benefit to participating officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives. All the Named Executive Officers participate in the benefit and those Company contributions under PSE s applicable tax-qualified plan that would otherwise have been earned, if not for IRS limitations, are credited by the Company to an account for each within the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Deferred Compensation Plan 
 The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100 of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments. In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the 
 150 

Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan. The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan. An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount. 
 The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds. The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index. For participants with deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available; however this does not apply to any of 2023 s Named Executive Officers. The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan. The 2023 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were: 
 
 Vanguard Total Bond Market Index 
 5.72 Vanguard 500 Index 
 26.24 Vanguard Money Market Index 
 5.09 
 
 The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time. Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter. 
 The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan from available alternatives. There are three types of in-service withdrawals. First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election. The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral. Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need. Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10 penalty. Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement. If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance. If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years). 
 
 Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
 The Estimated Potential Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control table below reflects the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of (i) a change in control; (ii) an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control; (iii) retirement; (iv) disability; or (v) death. 
 Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment. The only benefit payable to the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control is accelerated vesting of LTI Plan awards, under certain conditions, as described below. 
 
 Disability and Life Insurance Plans 
 If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will receive benefits under the PSE disability plan or life insurance plan available generally to all salaried employees. These disability and life insurance amounts are not reflected in the table below. The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance. The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65 of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits. The supplemental life insurance benefit is provided at two times base salary and target annual incentive bonus if the executive dies while employed by PSE with a reduction for amounts payable under the applicable group life insurance policy. 
 
 LTI Plan Awards 
 If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will be paid a pro-rata portion of LTI Plan awards that were granted in a prior year. In the case of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, pro-rata LTI Plan awards will be paid in the first quarter following the year of retirement, based 
 151 

on performance through the prior year. In the event of a change in control in which awards are not assumed or substituted, outstanding LTI Plan awards will be paid on a pro-rata basis at the higher of (i) target performance or (ii) actual performance achieved during the performance cycle ending with the fiscal quarter that precedes the change in control. 
 
 Employment Agreements 
 PSE has no employment agreements with any executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. 
 
 Estimated Potential Incremental Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
 The amounts shown in the table below assume that the termination of employment of a Named Executive Officer or a change in control was effective as of December 31, 2023. The amounts below are estimates of the incremental amounts that would be paid out to the Named Executive Officer upon a termination of employment or a change in control. Actual amounts payable can only be determined at the time of a termination of employment or a change in control. As Mr. Hasan and Mr. Smith were not employed as of December 31, 2023 and Mr. Doyle is not an employee, they are not included in the table:

 Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
 We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer in accordance with SEC Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
 For 2023, our last completed fiscal year: 
 The annual total compensation of our CEO reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table, was 6,571,118. 
 The median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (excluding our CEO) was 148,119. 
 
 As a result, for 2023 the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of our annual total compensation of all employees was 44.4. 
 We identified our median employee by examining the total cash compensation we paid during 2023 to all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2023, which totaled approximately 3,250 individuals, all located in the United States (as reported in Item 1. Business), including employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. Total cash compensation consisted of base salary, overtime, paid time off and annual incentives as reflected in our payroll records. We consistently applied this compensation measure and did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation. We believe that the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because it includes all major compensation elements available to employees. 
 After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation for 2023, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee for 2023 using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in 
 152 

the 2023 Summary Compensation Table in accordance with the requirements of Item 402 (c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Annual total compensation for 2023 for our median employee included annual salary, annual incentives, and company contributions towards benefits including retirement. Annual total compensation for 2023 for our CEO consists of the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2023 Summary Compensation Table. 
 
 Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023 
 The following table sets forth information regarding compensation paid by the Company to the directors named in the table who received compensation from the Company in 2023 for service as directors. We refer to these directors as non-employee directors. Directors who are employed by the Company or by the Company s investor-owners are not paid separately for their service and thus are not named in the table below. The directors who are employed by the Company s investor-owners are: Grant Hodgkins, Jenine Krause, Chris Parker, Aaron Rubin, and Steven Zucchet. 
 As described in further detail below, the Company s non-employee director compensation program in 2023 consisted of quarterly retainer cash fees of 45,500. Additional quarterly retainer amounts associated with serving as Chair of the Board, chairing Board committees, serving on the Audit Committee and meeting fees were also paid in cash.

 Non-employee Director Compensation Program 
 The 2023 non-employee director compensation program is based on the principles that the level of non-employee director compensation should be based on Board and committee responsibilities and should be competitive with comparable companies. 
 The 2023 compensation program for non-employee directors was as follows: 
 1. A base cash quarterly retainer fee of 45,500; 
 2. A 1,600 per meeting fee 800 for telephonic) will be paid when the number of Board or Committee meetings exceed six per year (not applicable to Asset Management Committee calls). 
 
 In 2023, non-employee directors were paid the following additional cash quarterly retainer fees: 
 1. Independent Board Chairman, 18,750; 
 2. Chair of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, 5,000; 
 3. Chair of the Governance Committee, 5,000; 
 4. Chair of the Business Planning Committee, 5,000 
 5. Chair of the Audit Committee, 5,000; and 
 6. Each member of the Audit Committee other than the chair, 1,250. 
 
 Non-employee directors were reimbursed for actual travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their services. Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company s matching gift program on the same terms as all Puget Energy employees. Under this program, the Company matches up to a total of 500 a year in contributions by a director to non-profit organizations that have IRS Section 501(c)(3) tax exempt status and are located in and served the people of PSE s service territory in Washington. 
 
 153 

Deferral of Compensation 
 Non-employee directors may choose to elect to defer all or a part of their cash fees under the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan for non-employee directors. Non-employee directors may allocate these deferrals into one or more measurement funds, which include an interest crediting fund, an equity index fund and a bond index fund. Non-employee directors are permitted to make changes in measurement fund allocations quarterly.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 
 Transactions with Related Persons 
 Our Boards of Directors have adopted a written policy for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Under the policy, our directors and executive officers are expected to disclose to our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer the material facts of any transaction that could be considered a related person transaction promptly upon gaining knowledge of the transaction. A related person transaction is generally defined as any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule. 
 
 Any transaction reported to the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer will be reviewed according to the following procedures: 
 1. If the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer determines that disclosure of the transaction is not required under the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be reported to the Audit Committee. 
 2. If disclosure is required, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer will submit the transaction to the Chair of the Audit Committee who will review and, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction. The Chair is authorized to approve or ratify any related person transaction involving an aggregate amount of less than 1.0 million or when it would be impracticable to wait for the next Audit Committee meeting to review the transaction. 
 3. If the transaction is outside the Chair s authority, the Chair will submit the transaction to the Audit Committee for review and approval or ratification. 
 
 When determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related person transaction, including: 
 1. The extent of the related person s interest in the transaction; 
 2. Whether the terms are comparable to those generally available in arm's length transactions; and 
 3. Whether the related person transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company. 
 
 If any related person transaction is not approved or ratified, the Committee may take such action as it may deem necessary or desirable in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
 Dan Koch, former Vice President of Energy Delivery who reported to the Chief Executive Officer for a period of time during the year ended December 31, 2023, is married to Catherine Koch, who is sole owner of Reimagine Energy Consulting. Reimagine Energy Consulting was paid 0.3 million for services provided to PSE in 2023 by Ms. Koch. This work was performed under the supervision of PSE's Senior Vice President of External Affairs. 
 
 Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
 Independence of the Board 
 The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors. Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, Scott Armstrong, Barbara Gordon, and Christine Gregoire (members of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE) and Diana Rakow (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws. Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (i) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (ii) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (iii) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (iv) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager. The Company s definition of "Independent Director" is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com. 
 In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at 
 156 

rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards. The Boards have also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of 1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year. These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 
 The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions. Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Rakow serve (or served) as directors or officers of, or otherwise have/had a financial interest in entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission. These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above. Because these relationships either fall within the Boards' categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships, in isolation, impair the independence of the applicable directors. 
 
 Executive Sessions 
 Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting. Mr. Armstrong, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions. Interested parties may communicate with the non-management directors of the Board through the procedures described in Item 10, "Directors, Executives Officers and Corporate Governance" of Part III of this Form 10-K under the section Communications with the Board.

 The Audit Committee of the Company has adopted policies for the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The policies are designed to ensure that the provision of these services does not impair the firm s independence. Under the policies, unless a type of service to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. In addition, any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
 The annual audit services engagement terms and fees, as well as any changes in terms, conditions and fees relating to the engagement, are subject to specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. In addition, on an annual basis, the Audit Committee grants general pre-approval for specific categories of audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within specified fee levels, that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. With respect to each proposed pre-approved service, the independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide detailed back-up documentation to the Audit Committee regarding the specific services to be provided. Under the policies, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of their members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decision to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate 
 157 

responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management. For 2023 and 2022, all audit and non-audit services were pre-approved.

The Costs of Transmission System Construction of the Transmission System Elective Capital Addition shall be determined and paid for by the Participating Transmission Owners in proportion to the respective Requirements Shares of the Participating Transmission Owners in each Segment to which the addition is made unless the Participating Transmission Owners agree to a different allocation among the Participating Transmission Owners within the one hundred twenty (120) day period set forth in Section 22(j). Transmission System Elective Capital Additions shall be so installed and operated as not to burden or unreasonably interfere with the facilities of the other Transmission Owners or the Transmission System, the construction on the Transmission System lands of additional Transmission System facilities, or the ultimate full utilization of the land for the Transmission System. In the event that a Transmission Owner proposes to install or operate facilities that would require the relocation of previously installed facilities of another Transmission Owner, or of the Transmission System, but would otherwise meet the requirements of the preceding sentence, the Transmission Owner desiring to install or operate such facilities shall have the right to require such relocation if it bears all direct and indirect costs of such relocation. Any increase in the transmission capacity of a Segment of the Transmission System that results from such Transmission System Elective Capital Addition shall be allocated among the Participating Transmission Owners in proportion to each Participating Transmission Owner s payment of Costs of Transmission System Construction of the - 31 - Transmission System Elective Capital Addition. The Transmission Owners shall amend this Agreement to increase the Requirements Capacity of each Participating Transmission Owner by the amount of its share of such increase in transmission capacity of such Segment. (b) Transmission Service Requests and Constructing Necessary New Facilities. Each Transmission Owner shall respond to a request it receives for transmission service (specifically excluding interconnection requests addressed in Sections 32(c) and 32(d) below) on the Transmission System consistent with applicable terms and conditions of its OATT and this Section 32(b) of this Agreement. In the event the requested transmission service cannot be provided without constructing new facilities, the Transmission Operator shall perform any required studies and coordinate the offering of study agreements as described in Section 4(c) of this Agreement only after: (i) a completed common Transmission Service application for long-term firm transmission service has been received by each Transmission Owner, (ii) receiving consent from the requesting customer to the sharing of information related to the request with the other Transmission Owners, to the extent such consent is necessary, and (iii) the Transmission System has insufficient available transfer capability to satisfy the transmission request. The Transmission Owners will use due diligence to commence and complete a Transmission System Capital Addition to add such new facilities only after the requesting party executes a long-term firm service agreement with each Transmission Owner. Any increase in the transmission capacity of a Segment of the Transmission System that results from such Transmission System Capital Addition shall be allocated among the Transmission Owners as set forth in Section 7(h) above. No Transmission Owner will have any obligation to commence or complete the Transmission System Capital Addition unless and until such long-term firm service agreement of such Transmission Owner provides for the sale to requesting party of a quantity of transmission capacity (within a megawatt) equal to: (1) Such Transmission Owner s available transfer capability, if any, plus, (2) A share of the additional requested capacity in excess of total available transfer capability of all Transmission Owners in the absence of the Transmission System Capital Addition, which share shall equal the product of: (A) such additional requested capacity, multiplied by (B) the proportion of such Transmission Owner s payment of Costs of Transmission System Construction of the Transmission System Capital Addition. - 32 - (c) Generator Interconnection Requests and Constructing Necessary New Facilities. Each Transmission Owner shall respond to a request for generator interconnection (specifically excluding transmission service requests addressed in Section 32(b) above and interconnection requests addressed in Section 32(d) below) to the Transmission System consistent with applicable terms and conditions of its OATT and this Section 32(c) of this Agreement. Each Transmission Owner shall respond to a request for generator interconnection to the Transmission System by (a) notifying the requesting customer to submit a common generator interconnection request to each Transmission Owner, and (b) requesting consent from the requesting customer to the sharing of information related to the request with the other Transmission Owners, to the extent such consent is necessary. Each Transmission Owner shall notify each other Transmission Owner of the receipt of a request, but not prior to receipt of the requesting customer s consent to the sharing of information related to the request, to the extent such consent is necessary. Queue position on each Transmission Owner s OASIS and the Transmission Owners commencement of processing of such interconnection requests, including the Transmission Operator's performance of any required studies as described in Section 4(c) of this Agreement, shall be based on the date by which the last Transmission Owner has received an interconnection request that is considered to be a valid request, and the customer has consented to the sharing of the request with the other Owners, to the extent such consent is necessary. Each Transmission Owner shall post on its OASIS any deviation from the study timelines established as described in Section 4(c) of this Agreement for generator interconnection requests. The Transmission Owners will engage in reasonable efforts to commence and complete a Transmission System Capital Addition to add the new facilities required for the requested interconnection only after the requesting party executes a single multi-party interconnection agreement with the Transmission Owners. (d) Transmission-to-Transmission Interconnection Requests and Constructing Necessary New Facilities. Each Transmission Owner shall respond to a request for transmission-to-transmission interconnection (specifically excluding transmission service requests addressed in Section 32(b) above and interconnection requests addressed in Section 32(c) above) to the Transmission System consistent with applicable terms and conditions of the orders and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and this Section 32(d) of this Agreement. Each Transmission Owner shall respond to a request for transmission-to-transmission interconnection to the Transmission System by (a) notifying the requesting customer to submit a common transmission-to-transmission interconnection request to each Transmission Owner, and (b) requesting consent from the requesting customer to the sharing of information related to the request with the other Transmission Owners, to the extent such consent is necessary. Each Transmission Owner shall notify each other Transmission Owner of the receipt of a request, but not prior to receipt of the requesting customer s consent to the sharing of information related to the request, to the extent such consent is necessary. The Transmission Owners shall commence processing of any such interconnection request, including the Transmission Operator s performance of any required studies as described in Section 4(c) of this Agreement, as of the date by which the last Transmission Owner has received an interconnection request that it deems valid, and the requesting customer has consented to the sharing of the request with the other Transmission - 33 - Owners, to the extent such consent is necessary. The Transmission Owners will engage in reasonable efforts to commence and complete a Transmission System Capital Addition to add the new facilities required for the requested interconnection only after the requesting party executes a single multi-party interconnection agreement with the Transmission Owners. (e) Each of the Transmission Owners releases all other Transmission Owners and their agents and employees from claims to profits, charges, rents, or benefits that may arise from use by any Transmission Owner of Transmission System real property and property rights permitted by this Section 32. 33. Regulatory Approval It is understood that transfers of property under this Agreement may be subject to the jurisdiction of state or federal regulatory agencies. Such transfers shall not be effective until all required approvals and all other required action by such agencies having jurisdiction shall have been obtained. 34. Rule Against Perpetuities or Similar or Related Rules If the duration of any term or condition of this Agreement shall be subject to the rule against perpetuities or a similar or related rule, then the effectiveness of such term or condition shall not extend beyond (i) the maximum period of time permitted under such rule, or (ii) the specific applicable period of time expressed in this Agreement, whichever is shorter. For purposes of applying the rule against perpetuities or a similar or related rule, the measuring live in being shall be of the officers and directors of Montana shown in its 1980 Annual Report, together with all such listed persons children, all of whom are living on the date of execution of this Agreement. As used in this paragraph, the word children shall have its primary and generally accepted meaning of descendants of the first degree. 35. Termination At any time after the end of the Project pursuant to Section 31 of the Ownership Agreement, any Transmission Owner, for any cause deemed by it sufficient, may propose termination of this Agreement. In such event, the Transmission Owner proposing termination shall offer to assign all its right, title and interest in and to the Transmission System to the other Transmission Owners, pro rata according to their then Transmission Ownership Percentages. Such other Transmission Owners shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase all or any part of such Transmission System at the then-depreciated original cost thereof, less cost of salvage. To the extent such facilities are not purchased by the other Transmission Owners, the Transmission Operator shall sell for removal to the highest bidder all salable parts of the Transmission System which can be removed from service without impairing the efficiency or usefulness of the Transmission System Capacity that each other Transmission Owner is entitled to use. After deducting all costs of such removal, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of meeting all applicable requirements of law, the Transmission Operator shall, if there are net proceeds, 

- 34 - distribute to each Transmission Owner whose interest in the Transmission System is being terminated its Transmission Ownership Percentage of said net proceeds. Upon such removal, this Agreement shall terminate as to those Transmission Owners proposing termination, and such Transmission Owners shall have no right, title or interest in the Transmission System remaining after such removal. If the right, title and interest of Transmission Owner proposing termination are not completely purchased by the other Transmission Owners, that portion not purchased shall become the property of such other Transmission Owners in proportion to their Transmission Ownership Percentage. If all Transmission System facilities are being removed from service and if the Transmission Operator should determine that they will bring a greater amount at salvage if sold as a unit, including land and structures, than they would if it were dismantled and the salable parts removed and sold, then the Transmission Operator may sell the Transmission System as a unit to the highest bidder. After deducting all costs of ending the Transmission System, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of decommissioning, razing all structures and disposing of the debris and meeting all applicable requirements of law, the Transmission Operator shall, if there are net proceeds, distribute to each Transmission Owner its proportionate share of such proceeds according to its Transmission Ownership Percentage. In the event such costs of ending the Transmission System exceed available funds, each Transmission Owner shall pay its Transmission Ownership Percentage of such excess as incurred. 36. Effective Date; Term This Agreement shall be effective and binding when: (1) executed by the Transmission Owners, and (2) accepted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission without the imposition of any conditions or modifications that are considered unacceptable by any Transmission Owner. Once effective, this Agreement shall supersede all prior versions. This Agreement shall continue until terminated pursuant to Section 35. 37. Miscellaneous (a) The headings of the clauses of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning or construction thereof. (b) The singular of any term in this Agreement shall encompass the plural and the plural the singular, unless the context otherwise indicates. (c) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Montana, except that Section 23 shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. (d) This Agreement shall not be amended except by written instrument executed, acknowledged and delivered by all of the Transmission Owners. - 35 - (e) This Agreement shall not be construed to create rights in, or to grant remedies to, any third party as a beneficiary of this Agreement or as a beneficiary of any duty, obligation, or undertaking established in this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict the right of any Person to seek an order from the Commission under the Federal Power Act. - 36 - IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement in several counterparts each of which is an original and all of which constitute one and the same agreement.

Exhibit B - 1 - EXHIBIT B REAL ESTATE (1) The Broadview Switchyard is located on the following real property: A tract of land situated in Section 34, Township 4 North, Range 23 East, P.M.M., being Tract B of Certificate of Survey No. 1520 Amended, as filed with the Clerk and Recorder of Yellowstone County, Montana, and containing 90.55 acres, more or less. (2) The Colstrip Switchyard is located on the following real property: A tract of land situated in the SE of Section 27, Township 2 North, Range 41 East, P.M.M., being Tract 1 of Certificate of Survey No. 35013, as filed with the Clerk and Recorder of Rosebud County, Montana, and containing 30.647 acres, more or less. Exhibit B - 2 - Exhibit C - 1 - EXHIBIT C CRITERIA FOR CAPACITY DETERMINATIONS Transmission Capacity determinations under Section 8 of this Agreement were made initially in accordance with the following procedures and criteria. Subsequent determinations, when necessary, will be made in accordance with the same procedures and criteria unless agreed otherwise by the Committee. Procedures: 1. Transmission Operator will make the determinations or arrange to have them made at the request of the Committee. 2. Determinations will be made by stressed system and forced flow computer simulations of the operation of appropriate portions of the interconnected network. 3. The simulations and resulting determinations of transmission capacity will be submitted to the Committee for review and concurrence. 4. Determinations will be made for both the Colstrip-Broadview Segment and the Broadview-Garrison (Broadview-Townsend) Segment of: (a) the Transmission System; (b) Montana s Transmission System; and (c) the integrated combination of the two Systems (Integrated System). 5. Determinations will be made for normal systems with all facilities in service. 6. Changes by the Committee in these procedures or criteria or changes in the system capacities because of future developments, additions or changed conditions will be recorded in appropriate amendments to this Exhibit C. Criteria: 1. Simulations to determine separate capacities of the Transmission System and of Montana s Transmission System will be performed with the two Systems isolated from each other east of Garrison insofar as is practical. 2. Transmission capacities for each System (i.e., the Transmission System, Montana s Transmission System and the Integrated System) in each segment will be determined by stressing only the system and segment being tested in a manner as agreed by the Committee. Exhibit C - 2 - 3. For the normal system determination (all facilities in service), tests of performance will be made by simulating line faults on the System being tested that cause the most severe disturbance. Satisfactory performance will be such that the System remains stable with normal clearing of the fault and the first post-fault voltage swing on any load bus in the interconnection remains at or above 80 of the nominal voltage. Generator unit dropping may be used in cases of certain three-phase faults to meet these criteria. Initial Capacity Determinations and Allocations: The parties, on the basis of several simulations performed to date of the Systems as they are projected to exist upon the initial commercial operation of Colstrip Units #3 and #4, have agreed upon initial allocations of the Integrated System Capacity in the following percentages: Colstrip- Broadview Segment Broadview Townsend (Garrison) Segment The Transmission System 87 75 Montana s Transmission System 13 25 The Integrated System 100 100 The Integrated System Capacity has been determined as follows, subject to further study and review by the Committee in accordance with the above procedures and criteria. The above percentage allocations will be applied to the Integrated System Capacity and will serve as the basis for the initial ratchet of Section 8(b). Coltstrip- Broadview Segment Broadview- Townsend Segment Integrated System Transmission Capacity 2,598 MW 2,573 MW

Colstrip Transmission System Transmission Service and Interconnection Processes and Procedures 1 COLSTRIP TRANSMISSION SYSTEM Transmission Service and Interconnection Processes and Procedures 1. PURPOSE These Colstrip Transmission System Transmission Service and Interconnection Processes and Procedures Procedures of Avista Corporation AVA ), NorthWestern Energy NWE ), PacifiCorp PAC ), Portland General Electric Company PGE ), and Puget Sound Energy, Inc. PSE (individually, Owner and in the plural, Owners ). These Procedures provide procedures for requesting transmission service on, a generator interconnection to, or a transmission-to-transmission interconnection to a segment of the Colstrip Transmission System. Pursuant to section 22(m) of the Colstrip Transmission Agreement (such agreement as may be amended from time-to-time, Agreement ), 1 each Owner agrees that it will respond to and process requests for transmission service on, a generator interconnection to, or a transmission-to-transmission interconnection to a segment of the Colstrip Transmission System in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in these Procedures. 2. DEFINITIONS Any capitalized term in these Procedures that is defined in the Owners Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATTs shall have the same meaning in these Procedures as set forth in the Owners OATTs unless such term is otherwise defined in the Agreement or these Procedures. 3. BACKGROUND The Colstrip Transmission System is jointly owned, operated, and maintained by the Owners pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. No Owner has the unilateral authority to grant an interconnection request to the Colstrip Transmission System, or expand or upgrade the Colstrip Transmission System in response to an interconnection or transmission service request. NorthWestern Energy acts as the designated operator of the Colstrip Transmission System under and pursuant to the Agreement. The Colstrip Transmission System consists of a 500 kV transmission system between Colstrip and Broadview, and Broadview and Townsend (there is no substation at Townsend). Bonneville Power Administration owns the 500 kV transmission system between Townsend and Garrison. Pursuant to the Agreement, each Owner is currently allocated transmission capacity on each segment of the Colstrip Transmission System as follows: 1 The Agreement is available on PGE s eTariff at: http://etariff.ferc.gov/TariffSectionDetails.aspx?tid=2698 sid=109262.

A Transmission Service Requests TSR An Eligible Customer is encouraged to submit a request for point-to-point transmission service (long-term or short-term) or network integration transmission service over a segment of the Colstrip Transmission System through the Request Portal, described below. Alternatively, an Eligible Customer may submit a transmission service request to one or more Owners, using each Owner s individual Open Access Same-Time Information System OASIS to request transmission service from that Owner within its existing available transfer capability ATC ). A transmission service request that seeks transmission capacity in excess of the Owners ATC must be submitted through the Request Portal. Requests submitted through an Owner s individual OASIS, rather than through the Request Portal, that seek transmission capacity in excess of the individual Owner s ATC may result in an incomplete application and thereby require further action by the Eligible Customer. When OASIS or the Request Portal is not operational, transmission service can be requested from each Owner via facsimile as provided for in each Owner s OATT through the incorporated North American Energy Standards Board Business Practice Standards. 4.2. Processing of a Long-Term Transmission Service Request Upon receipt of a long-term transmission service request by an Owner through the Request Portal, the following generally describes the process that will apply: Colstrip Transmission System Transmission Service and Interconnection Processes and Procedures 3 4.3. Processing of a Short-Term Transmission Service Request Upon receipt of a short-term transmission service request by an Owner through the Request Portal, the following generally describes the process that will apply: Does the Owner(s) that received a request have sufficient ATC? Is the application complete? Has the customer made a request to all Owners? YES NO YES NO Offer service; Owner(s) will update TSR Status YES NO Owner(s) will update the TSR s status to REFUSED due to insufficient application Owner(s) will advise customer of deficiency Is the deficiency cured? YES NO Owner(s) receives TSR Long-Term Transmission Service Request Processing Flowchart Owner(s) will advise customer and direct customer to portal Is the application complete?

Owner will offer partial service up to ATC if any ATC, otherwise deny service. YES NO Offer service; Owner will update TSR status Owner receives a short-term TSR Short-Term Transmission Service Request Processing Flowchart Colstrip Transmission System Transmission Service and Interconnection Processes and Procedures 4 4.4. Submission of a Transmission Service Request Using the Request Portal 4.4.1. Request Portal Access The Request Portal may be accessed through any Owner s OASIS. 4.4.2. Eligibility to Submit a Transmission Service Request through the Request Portal An Eligible Customer is only able to utilize the Request Portal to submit a transmission service request to those Owners with whom it is registered. Registration instructions are located on each Owner s OASIS. 4.4.3. Description of the Request Portal and Its Fields The Request Portal will have the following form. Request Portal Transmission Service Requests Segment [Insert] Start Date [Insert] End Date [Insert] AVA PGE PSE PAC NWE Total ATC (MW) Request (MW) from ATC [Insert] [Insert] [Insert] [Insert] [Insert] Additional Request (MW) [Insert] Total Allocation by Owner (MW) Segment Field: In the SEGMENT field, an Eligible Customer must select the desired POR and POD on the Colstrip Transmission System for its transmission service request from among the options available in the dropdown menu. Start/End Date Fields: In the START DATE and END DATE fields, an Eligible Customer must enter the date transmission service is desired to start and end, respectively, using the DD/MM/YYYY format. ATC Fields: Once the segment and start and end dates are entered, the Request Portal will display each Owner s available transmission capacity in its respective ATC 

Colstrip Transmission System Transmission Service and Interconnection Processes and Procedures 5 field for the requested segment(s). This information is imported from each Owner s OASIS. The quantity is displayed in whole megawatts. Request from ATC Fields: In the REQUEST FROM ATC field of any Owner, an Eligible Customer may enter the quantity of transmission desired (in whole megawatts) from such Owner. Only an amount up to an Owner s ATC may be entered in the REQUEST FROM ATC field for such Owner. If an Eligible Customer has not previously registered with an Owner, the Request Portal will not allow a quantity to be entered for that Owner. Additional Request Field: The amount entered in this field reflects the quantity of capacity requested in excess of the total ATC of the Owners. To submit a request for capacity to the extent that the request exceeds the total ATC of the Owners and request(s) for all available ATC of the Owner(s), if any, have been entered in the request fields, an Eligible Customer must enter the quantity of transmission desired (in whole megawatts) in the ADDITIONAL REQUEST field. The Request Portal will allocate the requested quantity in the ADDITIONAL REQUEST field to each Owner in a proportion equal to the percentage of each Owner s ownership in the segment(s). If the quantity requested crosses multiple segments of the Colstrip Transmission System, the Request Portal will allocate the requested quantity based on the segment with the lowest total Requirements Capacity. If a customer has not previously registered as an Eligible Customer with each Owner, the Request Portal will not allow a quantity to be entered. Total Allocation by Owner Fields: The Request Portal will calculate the total amount of capacity requested of each Owner (REQUEST plus ADDITIONAL REQUEST ), and display the quantities in the ALLOCATION BY OWNER fields. The quantities are displayed in whole megawatts. Submission of Request: An Eligible Customer submits the transmission service request to the Owner(s) by selecting the SUBMIT field. The Request Portal automatically submits the Eligible Customer s request to each applicable Owner s OASIS. 4.4.4. Application for Long-Term Transmission Service Once the request is submitted via the Request Portal, the Eligible Customer must complete the relevant portions of the common application for long-term firm transmission service, included as an attachment hereto.

 1. Purpose 
 Puget Energy, Inc. and Puget Sound Energy, Inc.

This Policy is intended to comply with, and be administered and interpreted consistent with, Listing Standard 303A.14 adopted by the New York Stock Exchange NYSE (the Listing Standards pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Rule 10D-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act Rule 10D-1 ). Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in Section 8 below. 
 
 2. Policy for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation 
 
 In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably promptly the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by an Executive Officer during the Recovery Period. 
 
 3. Administration 
 
 3.1. This Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the Administrator ).

Any determinations made by the Administrator under this Policy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 
 
 3.2. The Administrator is authorized to take appropriate steps to implement this Policy and may effect recovery hereunder by (i) requiring payment to the Company, (ii) set-off, (iii) reducing compensation, or (iv) such other means or combination of means as the Administrator determines to be appropriate. 
 
 3.3. The Company is not required to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation if and to the extent that the Administrator determines that such recovery is not required under Rule 10D-1 and the Listing Standards, including that (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered after making a reasonable attempt to recover or (ii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified broad-based retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder. 
 
 4. Indemnification Prohibition 
 
 The Company shall not indemnify or reimburse any Executive Officer with respect to amount(s) that may be recovered under this Policy. 
 
 5. Amendment Termination 
 
 The Administrator may amend or terminate this Policy from time to time in its discretion and as it deems necessary or appropriate provided, however, that any amendment or termination of this Policy shall not be effective unless it complies with any applicable law, listing standards, rules, orders or regulations applicable to the Company.

 8.7. Executive Officers means the Company s current and former executive officers as determined by the Administrator in accordance with the Listing Standards and Rule 10D-1. Generally, Executive Officers include any executive officer who would be treated as an officer under Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act.
