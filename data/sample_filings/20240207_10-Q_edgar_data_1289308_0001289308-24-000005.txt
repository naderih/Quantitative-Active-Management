The Company may sell certain US-originated accounts receivable balances up to a maximum amount of . In return for these sales, the Company receives a cash payment equal to the face value of the receivables and is charged a fee of Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus basis points against the sold receivable balance.

Non-recurring fair value measurements 
 
 On June 29, 2022, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Ooltewah, Tennessee, which focused on manufacturing flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for traditional motive power flooded cells will decrease as customers transition to maintenance free product solutions in lithium and Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL). As a result, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable and recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 a write-off of of the fixed assets, for which there is expected to be no salvageable value. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of fixed assets was a combination of the income and market approaches. The inputs used to measure the fair value of these fixed assets under the income approach were largely unobservable and accordingly were classified as Level 3. 
 
 On November 8, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to stop production and operations of residential renewable energy products, which include our OutBack and Mojave brands. Management determined that residential renewable energy products no longer fit with the company s core strategy and resources will be better allocated toward commercial energy solutions for enterprise customers. As a result the Company's indefinite-lived trademark, which were acquired through acquisition, was recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis at and the remeasurement resulted in an impairment of in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. In determining the fair value of these assets, the Company used a royalty rate of based on comparable market rates and used discount rate of . The inputs used to measure the fair value were largely unobservable and accordingly were classified as Level 3.

 Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
 
 The Company is exposed to changes in variable interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreement. On a selective basis, from time to time, it enters into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt. At December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 such agreements effectively convert of our variable-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, utilizing the one-month term SOFR, as a floating rate reference. Fluctuations in SOFR and fixed rates affect both our net financial investment position and the amount of cash to be paid or received by us under these agreements. 
 
 Derivatives in Net Investment Hedging Relationships 
 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 
 The Company uses cross currency fixed interest rate swaps to hedge its net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Euro. 
 
 On December 23, 2021, the Company entered into cross currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, with aggregate notional amounts of , to hedge its net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between U.S. Dollars and Euros. On September 29, 2022, the Company terminated its cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts, originally entered into on December 23, 2021, and received a net settlement of . The cash proceeds have been included in Proceeds from termination of net investment hedges in our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 On September 29, 2022, the Company entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of , maturing on December 15, 2027. The cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts qualify for hedge accounting as a net investment hedging instrument, which allows for them to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to offset the translation risk from those investments. Balances in the foreign currency translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, upon which they are recognized as a component of other income (expense). 
 
 Impact of Hedging Instruments on AOCI 
 
 In the coming twelve months, the Company anticipates that of pretax (gain) relating to lead, foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges will be reclassified from AOCI as part of cost of goods sold and interest expense. This amount represents the current net unrealized impact of hedging lead, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which will change as market rates change in the future. This amount will ultimately be realized in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income as an offset to the corresponding actual changes in lead, foreign exchange rates and interest costs resulting from variable lead cost, foreign exchange and interest rates hedged. 
 
 Derivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships 
 
 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
 
 The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany loans and foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. These are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded directly in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, the notional amount of these contracts was and , respectively.

 Economic Climate 
 
 The economic climate in North America, China and EMEA slowed in calendar 2022 after experiencing strong growth during calendar 2021. All regions experienced a rise in inflation in calendar 2023 and were negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine. We expect interest rates to continue to stay elevated and potentially decrease in the second half of calendar year 2024 in the U.S. and the Euro zone. China s slowing economy is facing further headwinds caused by pressure on the renminbi and the impact from its zero COVID polices that were relaxed in August of 2023. 
 
 Supply chain disruptions and cost spikes in certain materials that impacted EnerSys during calendar year 2022 and the beginning of calendar year 2023 started to stabilize during the second quarter of calendar year 2023. While there are still pockets of supply chain challenges and some elevated materials costs such as plastic resins, electronic components and utilities, other costs such as transportation have returned to pre-COVID levels. However, recent geopolitical tensions between Hamas and Israel have begun to disrupt shipments in the Red Sea. As a result, some ocean freight costs and transit times may temporarily increase until shipping in the region returns to normal. In addition, we have broadly achieved our hiring and labor retention goals in certain locations that were facing challenges at the beginning of the year. Generally, our mitigation efforts and ongoing lean initiatives have tempered the impact of the pandemic-related challenges. The market demand in our Motive Power and Specialty segments remains robust, but cyclical capex pauses in the communication networks market has decreased demand in the Energy Systems segment since our fiscal second quarter. 
 
 Volatility of Commodities and Foreign Currencies 
 
 Our most significant commodity and foreign currency exposures are related to lead and the Euro, respectively. Historically, volatility of commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates have caused large swings in our production costs. In the fiscal year 2024, we have experienced a range in lead prices from approximately 1.05 per pound to 0.90 per pound. We experienced elevated costs in some of our other raw materials such as plastic resins, steel, copper, acid, separator paper and electronics and elevated freight and increased energy costs. However, these increased costs have moderated during fiscal year 2024. 
 
 Customer Pricing 
 
 Our selling prices fluctuated during the last several years to offset the volatile cost of commodities. Approximately 25 of our revenue is now subject to agreements that adjust pricing to a market-based index for lead. Customer pricing changes generally 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 lag movements in lead prices and other costs by approximately six to nine months. In fiscal 2023 and 2024, customer pricing has increased due to certain commodity prices and other costs having increased throughout the year. 
 
 Based on current commodity markets, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether commodity prices will be higher or lower in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023. However, given the lag related to increasing our selling prices for inflationary cost increase, on average our selling prices should be higher in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023. As we concentrate more on energy systems and non-lead chemistries, the emphasis on lead is expected to continue to decline. 

Primary Operating Capital 
 
 As part of managing the performance of our business, we monitor the level of primary operating capital, and its ratio to net sales. We define primary operating capital as accounts receivable, plus inventories, minus accounts payable. The resulting net amount is divided by the trailing three month net sales (annualized) to derive a primary operating capital percentage. We believe these three elements included in primary operating capital are most operationally driven, and this performance measure provides us with information about the asset intensity and operating efficiency of the business on a company-wide basis that management can monitor and analyze trends over time. Primary operating capital was 911.6 million (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 26.5 at December 31, 2023, 1,057.0 million (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 26.7 at March 31, 2023 and 1,071.7 million at January 1, 2023 (yielding a primary operating capital percentage of 29.1 ). The primary operating capital percentage of 26.5 at December 31, 2023 improved by 20 basis points compared to March 31, 2023 and improved 260 basis points compared to January 1, 2023. The decrease in primary operating capital percentage at December 31, 2023 compared to March 31, 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable inventory as a result of lower sales and a seasonal reduction in accounts payable compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year. The decrease in primary operating capital percentage at December 31, 2023 compared to January 1, 2023 was primarily from a reduction in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of lower sales compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Primary operating capital and primary operating capital percentages at December 31, 2023, March 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 are computed as follows:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We believe that our financial position is strong, and we have substantial liquidity to cover short-term liquidity requirements and anticipated growth in the foreseeable future, with 333 million of available cash and cash equivalents and available and undrawn committed credit lines of approximately 747 million at December 31, 2023, availability subject to credit agreement financial covenants. 
 
 A substantial majority of the Company s cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities, capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions. The Company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic and foreign liquidity.

 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a second amendment to the Amended Credit Facility (as amended, the Second Amended Credit Facility ). As a result, the Second Amended Credit Facility, now scheduled to mature on September 30, 2026, consists of a 130.0 million senior secured term loan and a CAD 106.4 million 84.2 million) term loan (the Second Amended Term Loan and an 850.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Second Amended Revolver ). This amendment resulted in a decrease of the Amended Term Loan by 150.0 million and an increase of the Amended Revolver by 150.0 million. 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Third Amended Credit Facility ). The Third Amended Credit Facility provided new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to 300 million (the Third Amended Term Loan ), which was available to draw until March 15, 2023. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company drew 300 million in the form of the Third Amended Term Loan. The funds will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term Loan and Second Amended Revolver. In connection with the agreement, the Company incurred 1.2 million in third party administrative and legal fees recognized in interest expense and capitalized 1.1 million in charges from existing lenders as a deferred asset. Additionally, the Company derecognized the capitalized deferred asset and recognized the 1.1 million as deferred financing costs. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Fourth Amended Credit Facility ). The Fourth Amended Credit Facility replaces the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in the calculation of interest for both the Second Amended Revolver and the Second Amended Term Loan. 
 
 On January 11, 2024, we issued 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.625 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes ). Proceeds from this offering, net of debt issuance costs were 297.0 million and were utilized to pay down the Fourth Amended Credit Facility. We plan to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving portion of its existing credit facility (without a reduction in commitment). 
 
 During the nine months of fiscal 2024, we purchased 855,034 shares for 82.3 million. 
 
 We believe that our strong capital structure and liquidity affords us access to capital for future acquisitions, stock repurchase opportunities and continued dividend payments.

 Ooltewah 
 
 On June 29, 2022, the Company committed to a plan to close its facility in Ooltewah, Tennessee, which produced flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for traditional motive power flooded cells will decrease as customers transition to maintenance free product solutions in lithium and TPPL. The Company currently estimates that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately 18.5 million. Cash charges for employee severance related payments, cleanup related to the facility, contractual releases and legal expenses are estimated to be 9.2 million and non-cash charges from inventory and fixed asset write-offs are estimated to be 9.3 million. These actions will result in the reduction of approximately 165 employees. The majority of these charges are expected to be recorded by the end of calendar 2023. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, the Company recorded cash charges relating primarily to severance and manufacturing variances of 2.8 million and non-cash charges of 7.3 million relating to fixed asset write-offs.

 Fiscal 2021 Programs 
 
 Hagen, Germany 
 
 In fiscal 2021, we committed to a plan to close substantially all of our facility in Hagen, Germany, which produced flooded motive power batteries for electric forklifts. Management determined that future demand for the motive power batteries produced at this facility was not sufficient, given the conversion from flooded to maintenance free batteries by customers, the existing number of competitors in the market, as well as the near term decline in demand and increased uncertainty from the pandemic. We plan to retain the facility with limited sales, service and administrative functions along with related personnel for the foreseeable future. 
 
 We currently estimate that the total charges for these actions will amount to approximately 60.0 million of which cash charges for employee severance related payments, cleanup related to the facility, contractual releases and legal expenses were estimated to be 40.0 million and non-cash charges from inventory and equipment write-offs were estimated to be 20.0 million. The

 Interest expense of 39.1 million in the nine months of fiscal 2024 (net of interest income of 2.0 million) was 5.4 million lower than the interest expense of 44.5 million in the nine months of fiscal 2023 (net of interest income of 1.1 million). 
 
 The decrease in interest expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and in the nine months of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to lower borrowing levels and impact from interest rate swaps partially offset by higher interest rates. Our average debt outstanding was 970.5 million and 1,008.4 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 1,300.2 million and 1,361.6 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Included in interest expense are non-cash charges for deferred financing fees of 0.4 million and 1.2 million for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2024 and 0.5 million and 1.5 million in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2023.

 The Company s income tax provision consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 was based on the estimated effective tax rates applicable for the full years ending March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively, after giving effect to items specifically related to the interim periods. Our effective income tax rate with respect to any period may be volatile based on the mix of income in the tax jurisdictions, in which we operate, changes in tax laws and the amount of our consolidated earnings before taxes. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, and energy storage manufacturing among other provisions with tax credits available from 2023 to 2032, subject to phase down beginning in 2030. In particular the IRA creates a refundable tax credit, pursuant to Section 45X of the Internal Revenue Code IRC ), for battery cells and battery modules manufactured or assembled in the United States and sold to third parties. On December 14, 2023, the United States Treasury issued proposed regulations which provided further guidance related to the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. In the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2024, the IRA impact resulted in a reduction of our costs of goods sold and income tax payable of 59.1 million and 100.4 million, respectively. The issuance of the aforementioned proposed regulations resulted in a 28.7 million retroactive adjustment to the beginning of the effective date of the IRA, January 1, 2023, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. There is a possibility that additional clarification guidance is issued with respect to the Section 45X credit qualifications. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements are based on Management's judgement and best estimate utilizing the most current guidance. The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from management s current estimate . 
 
 The consolidated effective income tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 3.2 and 23.2 and for the nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 7.7 and 18.5 , respectively. The rate decrease in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year periods are primarily due to the impact of the IRA and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. 
 
 Foreign income as a percentage of worldwide income is estimated to be 52 for fiscal 2024 compared to 83 for fiscal 2023. This reduction is primarily due to the IRA impact on domestic earnings. The foreign effective tax rates for the nine months of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 11.0 and 15.0 , respectively. Income from the Company's Swiss subsidiary comprised a substantial portion of the Company's overall foreign mix of income for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and were taxed at an effective income tax rate of approximately 9 in both periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flow and Financing Activities 
 
 Operating activities provided cash of 320.2 million in the nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 135.8 million of cash provided in the nine months of fiscal 2023, with the increase in operating cash resulting mainly due to net earnings and activity in accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. Accounts receivable decreased or provided cash of 139.5 million, and inventory decreased or provided cash of 27.4 million. Additionally, accounts payable decreased or used cash of 45.7 million. These results were due to lower sales in the period compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In the nine months of fiscal 2024, net earnings were 208.2 million, depreciation and amortization 68.3 million, stock-based compensation 22.9 million, non-cash charges relating to exit charges 21.5 million, impairment of trademarks 6.0 million, allowance for doubtful debts of 1.9 million, derivative losses of 0.7 million, derivatives cash settlements of 0.2 million, and non-cash interest of 1.2 million. Prepaid and other current assets were a use of funds of 3.6 million, primarily from an increase of 6.9 million in prepaid taxes, 4.0 million in other prepaids, and 1.4 million in prepaid insurance partially offset by a decrease of 8.7 million in other prepaid expenses, such as non-trade receivables and other advances.

All components of inventory increased due to strategic investment, supply chain delays, new products and higher inventory costs from higher raw material costs, manufacturing and freight costs and to address the high backlog of customer orders. Accounts payable decreased or used cash of 31.6 million due to seasonal reduction. In the nine months of fiscal 2023, net earnings were 109.9 million, depreciation and amortization 69.0 million, stock-based compensation 18.8 million, non-cash charges relating to exit charges 8.4 million, primarily relating to the Ooltewah, Tennessee plant closure, derivative gains of 1.4 million, non-cash interest of 1.5 million, and allowance for doubtful debts of 0.7 million.

 Investing activities used cash of 13.7 million in the nine months of fiscal 2023 which primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 57.5 million relating to plant improvements, partially offset by proceeds from termination of a net investment hedge of 43.4 million. 
 
 Financing activities used cash of 271.2 million in the nine months of fiscal 2024. During the nine months of fiscal 2024, we borrowed 182.5 million under the Second Amended Revolver and repaid 327.5 million of the Second Amended Revolver. We repaid 19.1 million of the Second and Third Amended Term Loan, and net repayments on short-term debt were 0.4 million.

Treasury stock open market purchases were 22.9 million, payment of cash dividends to our stockholders were 21.4 million and payment of taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards were 6.4 million. Payments for financing costs for debt modification were 1.1 million. Proceeds from stock options were 1.1 million.

 As a result of the above, total cash and cash equivalents decreased by 14.0 million to 332.7 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to a decrease of 104.4 million to 298.1 million, in the nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Compliance with Debt Covenants 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a second amendment to the Amended Credit Facility (as amended, the Second Amended Credit Facility ). As a result, the Second Amended Credit Facility, now scheduled to mature on September 30, 2026, consists of a 130.0 million senior secured term loan (the Second Amended Term Loan ), a CAD 106.4 million 84.2 million) term loan and an 850.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Second Amended Revolver ). This amendment resulted in a decrease of the Amended Term Loan by 150.0 million and an increase of the Amended Revolver by 150.0 million. 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a third amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Third Amended Credit Facility ). The Third Amended Credit Facility provided new incremental delayed-draw senior secured term loan up to 300 million (the Third Amended Term Loan ), which was available to draw until March 15, 2023. During the fourth quarter, the Company drew 300 million in the form of the Third Amended Term Loan. The funds will mature on September 30, 2026, the same as the Company's Second Amended Term Loan and Second Amended Revolver. In connection with the agreement, the Company incurred 1.2 million in third party administrative and legal fees recognized in interest expense and capitalized 1.1 million in charges from existing lenders as a deferred asset. Additionally, the Company derecognized the capitalized deferred asset and recognized the 1.1 million as deferred financing costs. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the 2017 Credit Facility (as amended, the Fourth Amended Credit Facility ). The Fourth Amended Credit Facility replaces the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR in the calculation of interest for both the Second Amended Revolver and the Second Amended Term Loan. 
 
 All obligations under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility are secured by, among other things, substantially all of our U.S. assets. The Fourth Amended Credit Facility contains various covenants which, absent prepayment in full of the indebtedness and other obligations, or the receipt of waivers, limit our ability to conduct certain specified business transactions, buy or sell assets out of the ordinary course of business, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and take certain other actions. There are no prepayment penalties on loans under this credit facility. 
 
 We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our Fourth Amended Credit Facility and Senior Notes. We believe that we will continue to comply with these covenants and conditions, and that we have the financial resources and the capital available to fund the foreseeable organic growth in our business and to remain active in pursuing further acquisition opportunities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report and Note 11 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a detailed description of our debt. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 
 A table of our obligations is contained in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations of our 2023 Annual Report. As of December 31, 2023, we had no significant changes to our contractual obligations table contained in our 2023 Annual Report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Market Risks 
 
 Our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed. 
 
 Counterparty Risks 
 44 

Table of Contents 

We have entered into lead forward purchase contracts, foreign exchange forward and purchased option contracts, interest rate swaps, and cross currency fixed interest rate swaps to manage the risk associated with our exposures to fluctuations resulting from changes in raw material costs, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company s agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. Those contracts that result in a liability position at December 31, 2023 are 26.2 million (pre-tax). Those contracts that result in an asset position at December 31, 2023 are 1.0 million (pre-tax). The impact on the Company due to nonperformance by the counterparties has been evaluated and not deemed material. 
 
 We hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro. On September 29, 2022, we terminated our cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million and executed cross-currency fixed interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 150 million, maturing on December 15, 2027. Depending on the movement in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro at maturity, the Company may owe the counterparties an amount that is different from the notional amount of 150 million. 
 
 Excluding our cross currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, the vast majority of these contracts will settle within one year. 
 
 Interest Rate Risks 
 
 We are exposed to changes in variable U.S. interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreements, as well as short-term borrowings in our foreign subsidiaries. On a selective basis, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt. At December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 such agreements effectively convert 200.0 million of our variable-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, utilizing the one-month Term SOFR, as a floating rate reference. 
 
 A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased annual interest expense, by approximately 4.2 million on the variable rate portions of our debt. 
 
 Commodity Cost Risks Lead Contracts 
 
 We have a significant risk in our exposure to certain raw materials. Our largest single raw material cost is for lead, for which the cost remains volatile. In order to hedge against increases in our lead cost, we have entered into forward contracts with financial institutions to fix the price of lead. A vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. We had the following contracts outstanding at the dates shown below: 
 
 Date s Under Contract (in millions) # Pounds Purchased (in millions) Average Cost/Pound Approximate 
 of Lead 
 Requirements (1) 
 December 31, 2023 50.6 52.5 0.96 8 March 31, 2023 47.9 50.0 0.96 8 January 1, 2023 60.0 65.0 0.92 10 
 (1) Based on the fiscal year lead requirements for the periods then ended. 
 
 For the remaining quarter of this fiscal year, we believe approximately 100 of the cost of our lead requirements is known. This takes into account the hedge contracts in place at December 31, 2023, lead purchased by December 31, 2023 that will be reflected in future costs under our FIFO accounting policy, and the benefit from our lead tolling program. 
 
 We estimate that a 10 increase in our cost of lead would have increased our cost of goods sold by approximately 18 million in the third quarter and 54 million in the nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks 
 
 We manufacture and assemble our products globally in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Approximately 40 of our sales and related expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. Our sales revenue, production costs, profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. Additionally, as we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars, our financial results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 strength of the U.S. dollar. The principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the Euro, Swiss franc, British pound, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Mexican peso. 
 
 We quantify and monitor our global foreign currency exposures. Our largest foreign currency exposure is from the purchase and conversion of U.S. dollar based lead costs into local currencies in Europe. Additionally, we have currency exposures from intercompany financing and intercompany and third party trade transactions. On a selective basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and purchase option contracts to reduce the impact from the volatility of currency movements; however, we cannot be certain that foreign currency fluctuations will not impact our operations in the future. 
 
 At a point in time, we hedge approximately 5 - 10 of the nominal amount of our known annual foreign exchange transactional exposures. We primarily enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of the variation of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables. The vast majority of such contracts are for a period not extending beyond one year. 
 
 Gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged. The maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items. We also selectively hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure, primarily with foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with Topic 815 - Derivatives and Hedging. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we also entered into cross-currency fixed interest rate swap agreements, to hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Euro. 
 
 At December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, we estimate that an unfavorable 10 movement in the exchange rates would have adversely changed our hedge valuations by approximately 28.9 million and 11.0 million, respectively. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) and determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
