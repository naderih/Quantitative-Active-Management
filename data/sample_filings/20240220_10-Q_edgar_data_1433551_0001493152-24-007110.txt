shares of common stock of SGLA and shares of preferred stock of SGLA. Immediately
after completion of the share exchange, the Company has a total of shares of common stock outstanding and shares
of preferred stock outstanding. 

Prior to the merger, Luo Xiong and spouse Wo Kuk Ching and their immediate family members controlled of SGLA,
and of SGL. Following the merger, Luo Xiong and spouse Wo Kuk Ching and their immediate family members controlled 
of SGLA consolidated with SGL. 

As
SGLA and SGL were under common control at the time of the share exchange, the transaction is accounted for as a
combination of entities under common control in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. In
pooling-of-interests accounting, the financial statements of the previously separate companies for periods before the combination
are recast on a combined basis for all prior periods that the entities are under common control. The accompanying combined financial
statements for all periods presented are referred to as the consolidated 
financial statements . Accordingly, the Company s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and June 30,
2023, and for the three-month and six-months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, include SGLA s, SGL s, and Tian
Li s historical assets, liabilities, and results of operations, including the issuance of shares of common stock
of SGLA and shares of preferred stock of SGLA on October 1, 2023, as if the combination and issuance of shares occurred at
the beginning of the earliest period presented. 

The
Company conducts its business through its subsidiary Tian Li, which operates in Malaysia as an environmental technology company and recycler
of plastic waste bottles and plastic packaging materials. 

Going
concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the six months
ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of ,
and used cash in operating activities of .
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that
the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately
to attain profitable operations. Management believes additional cash required to meet the Company s obligations as they become
due will be provided by way of advances from related parties. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be
available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional
financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution
for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

shares
of common stock. For the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share are the same because
these potential dilutive securities would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

Management
assesses the carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset,
an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. For the three and six months ended December
31, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of its property and equipment.

of 476,948. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Sino Green Land Corporation s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. In addition, Sino Green Land Corporation s independent registered
public accounting firm, in their report on Sino Green Land Corporation s June 30, 2023, audited financial statements, raised substantial
doubt about the Sino Green Land Corporation s ability to continue as a going concern. No assurance can be given that any future
financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the
Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing,
or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

As
of December 31, 2023, We had total current assets of 889,297 consisting of cash on hand of 411,266, accounts receivables of 35,432,
inventory of 202,672, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of 239,927, compared to total current assets of 480,6027 as of
June 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the increase in cash and prepaid expenses. We had current liabilities of 3,797,751 consisting
of accounts payable of 309,493, customer advances of 14,747, convertible note payable of 750,000, current portion of bank borrowings

by operating activities was mainly due to the fact that the decrease from the accrued liabilities and other payables and prepayment impact
on cash flows.

Cash
flow used in investing activities was 87,409 and 390,918 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

of December 31, 2023, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital

DISCLOSURE
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2023. This evaluation was carried out by Wo Kuk Ching Ms. Wo ), our
Chief Executive Officer and Wong Ching Wing Elise ), our Chief Financial Officer, who also serve as our principal executive
officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively. Based upon that evaluation, Ms. Wo and Elise concluded that, as
of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

The material weaknesses identified include (i) the Company did not maintain
a functioning independent audit committee and did not maintain an independent board; (ii) the Company had inadequate segregation of duties;
and (iii) the Company had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing
training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
