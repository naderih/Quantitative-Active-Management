Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Throughout this section, references to "Roadzen," we, us, and our refer to Roadzen Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as the context so requires. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, and continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our strategy, expansion plans, future operations, future operating results, estimated revenues, losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as all other statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in Risk Factors, Critical Accounting Estimates, Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Liquidity and Capital Resources in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. We urge you to consider these factors, risks and uncertainties carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 our ability to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to support our operations and growth; 

the fact that we may be unable to accurately predict our future capital needs, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all; 

substantial regulation and the potential for unfavorable changes to, or our failure to comply with, these regulations, which could substantially harm our business and operating results; 

our management team s limited experience managing a public company; 

the risk that our significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; and 

the other factors set forth in Risk Factors, Critical Accounting Estimates, Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Quarterly Report and our other SEC filings.

Roadzen Inc. Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (in USD) 

 par value ("Ordinary Shares") as follows: (i) each outstanding share of common stock of Roadzen (DE) including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of each outstanding share of Roadzen (DE) s convertible preferred stock, was cancelled and converted into Ordinary Shares, (ii) each restricted stock unit of Roadzen (DE) Roadzen (DE) RSU was assumed and converted into the right to receive restricted stock units of the Parent Company (each, a RDZN RSU and were assumed as Substitute Awards under the Roadzen Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan, (iii) each equity security of Roadzen (DE) other than Roadzen (DE) common stock and Roadzen (DE) RSUs (each, a Roadzen (DE) Additional Security was assumed and converted into the right to receive equity interests that may vest, settle, convert or be exercised into Ordinary Shares, (iv) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing was cancelled, retired and ceased to exist, and (v) each ordinary share of Vahanna (each, a Vahanna Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and not redeemed in connection with the Redemption (as defined below) remained outstanding and is now Ordinary Share. Further, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (the Closing ), Vahanna changed its name to Roadzen Inc. . Beginning on September 22, 2023, the Company s Ordinary Shares and warrants trade on the Nasdaq Global Market and Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol RDZN and RDZNW respectively. The Company determined that Roadzen (DE) was the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 805. The determination was primarily based on the following facts: - Roadzen (DE) stockholders having a controlling voting interest in the Company; - Roadzen (DE) existing management team serving as the initial management team of the Company and holding a majority of the initial board of directors of the Company; - Roadzen (DE) management continuing to hold executive management roles for the post-combination company and being responsible for the day-to-day operations; and - Roadzen (DE) operations comprising the ongoing operations of the Company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Roadzen (DE) issuing stock for the net assets of Vahanna, accompanied by a recapitalization. The primary assets acquired from Vahanna related to cash amounts and a forward purchase agreement ("FPA") that was assumed at fair value upon closing of the Business Combination. No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded as a result of the Business Combination. While Vahanna was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Roadzen (DE) was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Roadzen (DE) became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements reflect (i) the historical operating results of Roadzen (DE) prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of Vahanna and Roadzen (DE) following the closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Roadzen (DE) at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company s equity structure for all periods presented. In accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the equity structure has been retroactively restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date, to reflect the number of Ordinary Shares issued to Roadzen (DE) common shareholders, Roadzen (DE) convertible preferred shareholders and holders of Vahanna ordinary shares not redeemed in connection with the Redemption. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to Roadzen (DE) convertible preferred stock, the common stock of Roadzen (DE) and Vahanna Ordinary Shares not redeemed in connection with the Redemption prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business Combination. 

Distribution fee from underwriting and pricing: The Company enters into contracts with insurance companies for the purpose of underwriting insurance products for the automotive segment including its pricing on behalf of insurers. The risk of underwriting the insurance contract is covered by the insurer and thus the Company is considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing revenue. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to underwrite and price the policies. The Company generates underwriting fees termed as Managing General Agent fees (MGA fees) on provision of those services. The underwriting fees are determined as a percentage of net insurance premiums payable to the insurer (net of all commissions, royalties, and administration fees). Revenue from underwriting and pricing is recognized upfront based on the point in time i.e., at the time the policy is issued to the customer. IaaS platform enabled services: Roadside assistance and extended warranty income: The Company enters into contracts with insurance companies and other subscribers in order to provide roadside assistance services and extended warranty services to their policyholders/subscribers. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to provide roadside assistance and extended warranty services as a stand ready obligation. The Company is the primary obligor in these transactions and has latitude in establishing prices and selecting and contracting with suppliers, and is accordingly considered as principal for the purpose of recognizing gross revenue. Revenue from roadside assistance and extended warranty services is recorded over the tenure of contract which is usually . Inspection income: The Company enters into contracts with insurance companies to inspect vehicles for accident claims made by their policyholders. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to inspect and assist in assessing claims for and on behalf of the customers, i.e. the insurance companies. The Company engages with multiple vendors to provide these services in different geographies. The Company is the primary obligor in the transaction and has latitude in establishing prices, and selecting and contracting with suppliers, and is accordingly considered as principal for the purpose of recognizing revenue. Revenue from inspection and risk assessment is recorded when the inspections are conducted. Administration fee from insurance support and service plan administration: The Company enters into contracts with insurance companies to provide insurance support services which includes premium collection, policy administration, claims handling and processing, customer service, updating customer files, etc., to provide better customer experience for the policyholders/subscribers. Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied through effort expended to research, investigate, evaluate, document and process claims, and control of these services are transferred to customers/insurance companies. The Company s obligation to manage and process the claims under insurance support services can range from one to . The Company receives administration fees from its customers at inception of the contract prior to completion of transferring the services to the customer. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to provide the above services as a stand ready obligation. The obligation to provide insurance services lies with the insurer and the Company has no interest other than receiving the commission/management fee retained. The Company provides the above services on behalf of the insurance companies and is accordingly considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing revenue. The Company enters into contracts with Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") primarily to administer the service plans/extended warranty schemes launched by OEMs. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to administer these programs. The Company acts on behalf of the OEMs and is accordingly considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing revenue, as the primary obligation to fulfill the service/extended warranty schemes belongs to the OEMs. The administration fees received from the provision of service plan administration is recorded ratably over the tenure of contract which usually ranges from one to . Contract assets and liabilities A contract asset (unbilled revenue) is the right to receive consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract liabilities consist of amounts paid by the Company s customers for which the associated performance obligations have not been satisfied and revenue has not been recognized based on the Company s revenue recognition criteria described above. Contract liabilities are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur in more than one year from the balance sheet date.

Leasehold improvements related to office facilities are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. The Company reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its property and equipment on an ongoing basis. Management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the Company s business model, changes in the Company s business strategy, or changes in the planned use of property and equipment could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company s current estimates. In cases where the Company determines that the estimated useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended, the Company would apply the new estimated useful life prospectively. The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Costs of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses. 
 
 Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, short-term operating lease liabilities, current and long-term operating lease liabilities, non-current on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. 
 
 reporting unit. The Company completed the annual impairment test and recognized goodwill impairment charges in the years ended March 31, 2023.

Due to the change in the business strategy, it was more likely than not that the carrying value of the distribution entities exceeded its fair value. As a result, the Company performed an impairment assessment by comparing the fair value of the affected entities (FA Events and Media Private Limited, Peoplebay Consultancy Services Private Limited, Kintsugi Innovation Labs Private Limited) to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by using DCF (discounted cashflow method) which is a level 3 measurement. The carrying value of the affected entities exceeded its fair value and as a result, an impairment charge of (including CTA impact of was recorded in consolidated statements of operations under the head "Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with definite life" for the year ended March 31, 2023.

As a result, the Company performed a goodwill impairment assessment during the year ended March 31, 2023, by comparing the fair value of the affected entities (FA Events and Media Private Limited, Peoplebay Consultancy Services Private Limited, Kintsugi Innovation Labs Private Limited) to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by using DCF (discounted cashflow method) which is a level 3 measurement. The carrying value of the affected entities exceeded its fair value and as a result, a goodwill impairment charge of (including amount of due to foreign exchange fluctuation) was recorded in consolidated statements of operations under the head "Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with definite life" during the year ended March 31, 2023.

The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company's judgement regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company's income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. The Company's valuation allowance increased by during the nine months ended December 31, 2023 and during the year ended March 31, 2023. The Company has not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Net operating loss and credit carry forwards As of December 31, 2023, the Company has U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately , of which none are subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (IRC Section 382). The federal net operating loss carry forwards that were generated prior to the 2018 tax year will begin to expire in 2030 if not utilized. For net operating loss carry forwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the tax act limits the Company's ability to utilize carryforwards to 80 of taxable income, however, these operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The state (Delaware) net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in 2032 if not utilized. The Company has foreign tax credits which will expire at the end of years from the end of the assessment year in which these tax credits were originated. Utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the inability to fully offset future annual taxable income and could result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization. The Company continually reviews the impact to net operating losses of any ownership changes. Unrecognized tax benefits The Company has adopted authoritative guidance which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Company s income tax return, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company did t have any unrecognized tax benefits with a significant impact on its financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth or referred to under the section titled Risk Factors or elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 Roadzen is a leading Insurtech company on a mission to transform global auto insurance powered by advanced AI. At the heart of our mission is our commitment to create transparency, efficiency, and a seamless experience for the millions of end customers who use our products through our insurer, OEM, and fleet (such as trucking, delivery, and commercial fleets) partners. We seek to accomplish this by combining computer vision, telematics and AI with continually updated data sources to provide a more efficient, effective and informed way of building auto insurance products, assessing damages, processing claims and improving driver safety. Insurers and other partners of Roadzen across the world use Roadzen s technology to launch new auto insurance products, manage risk better and resolve claims faster. These products are built with dynamic underwriting capabilities, API-led distribution and real-time claims processing. 
 Roadzen has built a pioneering technology platform that uses telematics, computer vision and data science to spearhead innovation across the insurance value chain, namely underwriting, distribution, claims and road safety. We call it the Roadzen Insurance as a Service IaaS platform. Our business generates commission-based revenue as an insurance broker focused on embedded and B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Customer) insurance distribution, and fee-based revenue as a provider of innovative cloud, mobile, AI-based telematics applications for the auto insurance economy. 
 
 Roadzen has clients within the following ecosystems: 
 Insurance including insurance companies, reinsurers, agents, brokers; 
 Automotive including carmakers, dealerships, online-to-offline car sales platforms; 
 Fleets including small and medium fleets, taxi fleets, ridesharing platforms, commercial and corporate fleets; and 
 Other distribution channels such as financial services companies providing auto loans and telematics companies. 
 
 Our operations are global, and our partners consists of market-leading insurers and OEMs, including AXA, Soci t G n rale and others. In June of 2023, we made two acquisitions as part of our market entry strategy into the important US and UK markets. Our subsidiary in the UK, Global Insurance Management Ltd. ("GIM"), is a leading specialist Managing General Agent ("MGA") providing auto insurance, extended warranties, and claims management to insurers, car dealers, car companies, and fleets. GIM delivers services globally, leveraging its MGA licenses in the UK market and using third-party licenses elsewhere. GIM provides brokerage services to insurance companies, where it acts as a delegated authority of the insurance company to sell the insurer s policies using its brokerage platform, as well as to adjudicate and pay claims. GIM collects a percentage commission and an administrative fee of the GWP from the insurer/re-insurer during this process. GIM s specialty insurance contracts typically have an average term of five years. Roadzen's subsidiary in the US, National Automobile Club ("NAC"), is a licensed auto club in California and a provider of claims management and 24/7 commercial roadside assistance in the US. NAC focuses on the commercial automotive industry and its network comprises over 75,000 professional service providers, offering tow, transport, and first notice of loss FNOL services. NAC s customers include government enterprises, commercial fleets, car companies and insurers across the US. NAC is headquartered in Burlingame, California. 
 We have received global recognition, having recently been recognized as one of the 'Top 10 Insurtech Solution Providers 2023' by Enterprise Viewpoint in October 2023. Roadzen also won two awards at the prestigious 2022 Global Artificial Intelligence Summit Awards for the Best Use of AI in Mobility and Best Use of AI in Insurance categories held by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and All India Council for Robotics Automation (AICRA). In 2022, Roadzen was awarded AI Startup of the Year by Financial Express (India) and in October 2021, Roadzen was recognized by Forbes Magazine as a Top 10 AI company. We believe that these awards are an acknowledgment of our customer impact and technological superiority. 
 
 35 

On September 20, 2023, Roadzen Inc. (then known as Vahanna Tech Edge Acquisition I Corp.)(the Parent Company completed a business combination transaction (the Business Combination in which it acquired Roadzen, Inc., a Delaware corporation Roadzen (DE) ). Roadzen (DE) was determined to be the accounting acquiror in the Business Combination. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Roadzen (DE) became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Roadzen (DE) prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of the Parent Company and Roadzen (DE) following the Closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Roadzen (DE) at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company s equity structure for all periods presented. 
 
 Our Business Model 
 
 Roadzen has two principal models for generating revenue: 1) platform sales of our IaaS platform, and 2) brokerage commission and fees. We follow a capital-light business model, meaning that we do not underwrite any risk ourselves or carry it on our balance sheet for either source of revenue. 
 
 1. Platform Sales : 
 
 Roadzen provides an IaaS platform addressed towards insurance for mobility. The IaaS platform has a suite of products that work cohesively to address the auto insurance value chain. Roadzen sells its IaaS platform to insurers, car manufacturers, and fleet companies to deliver services for their respective insured customers. Our deep understanding of the insurance industry has enabled us to develop a unified suite of modules and products that is tailored to address the key challenges faced in auto insurance. Our solution suite includes several products that support the insurance lifecycle, such as: 
 Via : enables fleets, carmakers and insurers to inspect a vehicle using computer vision; 

xClaim : enables digital, touchless and real-time resolution of claims from FNOL through payment, using telematics and computer vision; 

StrandD : enables digital, real-time dispatch and tracking for roadside assistance ("RSA") and FNOL during accident claims; and 

Good Driving : enables insurers and fleets to recognize their best drivers, train poor drivers and build usage based insurance ("UBI") programs. 

Our technology revolutionizes the customer experience by helping customers obtain a policy within seconds and process a claim estimate within minutes in comparison with existing processes that can take weeks. Roadzen s revenue derived from platform sales is usage-based, meaning we get paid on a per-vehicle or per-use basis. 
 
 Sales of Roadzen s IaaS platform represented approximately 48 and 52 of revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 2. Brokerage Commission and Fees : 
 
 Roadzen acts as an insurance broker utilizing its technology to sell insurance through our embedded and Business to Business to Consumer ("B2B2C") distribution model. The policies are sold by insurance intermediaries such as agents and through captive distributors such as dealerships, fleets and used car platforms. Our B2B2C channel partners choose us for a variety of reasons for the ease of integrating our technology through APIs into their ecosystem, for a seamless, fully digital customer experience from obtaining a policy to submitting a claim, and for integrations with a large number of insurance companies who sell their policies through our platform to give the users a handful of policy options. Lastly, we can provide a superior customer experience by bundling telematics for road safety, RSA and claims management to the customer a customer experience that we believe is unrivaled by other traditional brokers. Roadzen s revenues are based on commissions and other fees that are paid by our insurance carriers as a percentage of the Gross Written Premium ("GWP") underwritten for each policy. 
 
 Roadzen s brokerage solutions accounted for 52 and 48 of revenues for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 
 Investment in Core Technology and AI 
 
 We continue to develop and invest in our technology platform to drive scalability and build innovative products. We believe our significant proprietary investments into our data pipelines, training, model development and our core technology platform are key advantages that allow us to stay ahead of competition, support our growth into global markets and improve operating margins. 
 
 Investment in Sales and Marketing 
 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are a key component of our growth strategy. Our investments in this area have enabled us to build and sustain our customer base while creating long-term customer relationships. Our sales efforts are materially dependent on our three different channels: (1) strategic sales to insurers and car companies; (2) sales to small-and-medium fleet owners; and (3) brokerage sales driven by agents, captive distribution channels and reinsurance partnerships. We plan to continue investing in each of these channels of growth including hiring sales personnel, event marketing and global travel. 
 
 Investments in Innovation for Future Growth 
 
 The world of mobility is changing rapidly due to advances in connected, electric, and autonomous vehicles. We believe this presents an exciting and large opportunity to build insurance for this evolving environment. For this reason, our performance will be impacted by our ability to continuously innovate our underwriting algorithms, internalize new data sources and technologies such as Advanced Driving Assistance Systems ("ADAS") and video telematics for accident prevention, and invest in partnerships with carmakers for their insurance offerings and for selling insurance into fleets. 
 
 Acquiring New Customers 
 
 Our long-term growth will depend on our continued ability to attract new customers to our platform. We intend to continue to drive customers to our platform by expanding our B2B2C model through different avenues. 
 In addition to our existing geographic and product footprint, we aim to grow by expanding into new markets across our target geographies, leveraging our technology platform to increase our speed to market. 

We intend to consistently offer cutting edge technology at the intersection of mobility and insurance - a capability that traditional insurance carriers and other insurance intermediaries have struggled to provide. As our clients look to digitize and capture a greater part of the insurance value chain, our technology is the differentiator for them to choose Roadzen as a partner. 

Expanding Sales Within Our Existing Customer Base 
 
 A central part of our strategy is expanding solutions adoption across our existing customer base. We have developed long-term relationships with our customers and have a proven track record of successfully cross-selling product offerings. We have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling additional functionality to customers that do not currently utilize our full solution portfolio from our platform. As we innovate and bring new technology and solutions to market, we also have the opportunity to realize incremental growth by selling new products to our existing customer base. 

Our ability to expand sales within our customer base will depend on a number of factors, including our customers satisfaction, pricing, competition, and changes in our customers spending levels. Roadzen s customers include leading insurers and car companies that have a global presence and are spending millions of dollars on digitizing their insurance offerings. We believe that successful integration in one geography may open up opportunities within other geographies. Roadzen has shown the ability to expand contracts from low ticket size in India to higher ticket size in global markets. We have a significant focus on maximizing the lifetime value of our customer relationships, and we continue to make significant investments in order to grow our customer base. 
 
 Since January 1, 2023 we began tracking customer segmentation for Roadzen, described as such: enterprise clients that include insurers, automakers and large fleets (above 100 vehicles), and SMB clients, which include agents, brokers, small dealerships, and small fleets (under 100 vehicles). As of December 31, 2023, we had 31 insurance customer agreements (including carriers, self-insureds and other entities processing insurance claims), 65 automotive customer agreements, and approximately 2,400 agents and 796 fleet customers agreements. 
 37 

Strength of the Auto Insurance Market 
 We generate a majority of our revenues through commissions and fees which are a reflection of the total insurance policy premium. Roadzen derived 52 of revenue from its brokerage solutions and 48 from its platform sales of its IaaS platform for the three months ended December 31, 2023. A softening of the insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates due to competition or regulation could negatively impact our financial results. 
 
 Our Regulatory Environment 
 
 Our insurance broking business is subject to various laws and regulations and our inability to comply with them may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and reputation. 
 
 Our subsidiary in India is licensed to act as a direct insurance broker (life and general) under the Insurance Brokers Regulations of India. Accordingly, we are subject to certain laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Insurance brokers operating in India are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, including stipulations that: (i) the principal officer and broker qualified persons of an insurance broker must undergo training and pass the relevant examinations specified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (the IRDAI (ii) the principal officer, directors, shareholders and key management personnel must fulfill the fit and proper criteria specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations; (iii) insurance brokers may not undertake multi-level marketing for solicitation and procuring of insurance products; (iv) insurance brokers may not offer any rebate or any other inducement to a client; (v) insurance brokers must conduct their business in compliance with the code of conduct specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations; and (vi) insurance brokers must ensure that not more than 50 of their remuneration emanates from one client in a financial year. The IRDAI may undertake inspection of the premises of an insurance broker to ascertain how activities are carried on, and inspect their books of accounts, records and documents. The Insurance Brokers Regulations specify certain approval and reporting requirements to be adhered to by the insurance brokers from time to time, as applicable. We would be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the Insurance Brokers Regulations. We derive revenues primarily from commissions and other fees paid by insurance carriers for insurance products purchased by our customers. 
 
 The commissions that we can charge to our insurer partners are based on charges set forth under the IRDAI (Payment of Commission or Remuneration or Reward to Insurance Agents and Insurance Intermediaries) Regulations, 2016 IRDAI Commissions Regulations ). The IRDAI (Minimum Information Required for Investigation and Inspection) Regulations, 2020 Minimum Information Regulations ), effective from May 23, 2021, are applicable to all insurers and insurance intermediaries in relation to purposes of investigation and inspection by the IRDAI. 
 
 Inter-related companies within the group are subject to a stringent regulatory framework that affects the flexibility of our operations and increases compliance costs, and any regulatory action against us and our employees may result in penalties and/or sanctions that could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and is subject to change. The government of India GoI may implement new laws or other regulations and policies that could affect the fintech industry, which could lead to new compliance requirements, including requiring us to obtain approvals and licenses from the GoI and other regulatory bodies, or impose onerous requirements. New compliance requirements could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our subsidiary in the UK is licensed as a Managing General Agent ("MGA"), under which we are subject to stringent oversight by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). Our operations must align with FCA regulations that are specifically tailored to govern the conduct and obligations of MGAs, which act as an intermediary between insurers and clients, with delegated authority to underwrite and process claims on behalf of insurers. Our adherence to these regulations encompasses a variety of compliance obligations, including but not limited to, ensuring that underwriting decisions are made with the requisite skill and care, maintaining accurate and secure records of insurance contracts, managing potential conflicts of interest, and safeguarding client funds. The FCA also imposes comprehensive conduct rules and solvency requirements that require us to act with due care in the interests of policyholders. 
 
 The FCA's regime for MGAs mandates a high level of financial prudence and transparency, necessitating robust internal controls and reporting systems. Failure to meet these stringent regulatory requirements could result in significant sanctions, including financial penalties, suspension of authorization, or other disciplinary actions. Given the evolving nature of the regulatory environment, changes in the FCA s rules or the introduction of new legislation could necessitate adjustments to our operational and compliance processes. These changes could carry implications for our business model and may incur additional compliance costs, ultimately impacting our financial results and operational flexibility. 
 
 38 

Roadzen is committed to maintaining a rigorous compliance posture to meet the FCA's expectations for MGAs. Any lapse in our compliance framework could lead to regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, and negatively affect our business operations and financial position. It is imperative for us to continuously monitor regulatory developments and adapt our compliance measures accordingly to mitigate the risk of enforcement actions and to uphold the trust of our clients and partners. 
 
 The FCA has recently conducted a comprehensive review of the Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) product, a key contributor to our operations in the UK, resulting in a directive for all insurers, including our insurance partner, to temporarily cease selling the GAP product in February 2024. The regulator has mandated that insurers make a resubmission, or new GAP proposal, outlining the product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP product can be resumed. 
 
 As our insurance partner is obligated to adhere to FCA guidelines, any delay or challenges in their obtaining FCA approval of their resubmission may have a negative impact on our business. The resubmission process introduces uncertainty, as there is no guarantee of swift regulatory approval. The temporary suspension of GAP sales may have a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall profitability. We are actively working with our insurance partner to address the concerns raised by the regulator, expedite the resubmission process, and seek timely FCA approval to resume GAP sales, however, there can be no assurance that the resubmission will receive prompt regulatory approval. Delays in obtaining approval may result in prolonged disruption to our business operations, potential reputational damage, and potential loss of clients and customer confidence. Additionally, the resubmission process may require adjustments to the GAP product, potentially increasing our costs and decreasing our profit margin and any delays or unfavorable outcomes may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our subsidiary in the USA is licensed as an auto club in California, which exposes Roadzen to a distinct set of risks due to the stringent regulatory landscape enforced by the California Department of Insurance ("CDI"). Compliance with these regulations is paramount, as they govern a wide spectrum of our activities, including membership services, claims management, and financial integrity. 
 
 Our Ability to Manage Risk with Data and Technology 
 
 Our operations are highly dependent on the reliability, availability, and security of our technology platform and data. Our operations rely on the secure processing and storage of confidential information, including our information systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers. Disruptions in the technology platform, systems and control failures, security breaches, or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in legal exposure, harm our reputation and brand, and ultimately affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and have taken protective actions to reduce risk, such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized and malicious attacks. As our technology-enabled platform is reliant on data from external parties, such attacks or disruption in our data sources can impact our ability to operate effectively and result in damage to our reputation and results. 

Lock-up Agreements 
 In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, certain holders of equity in Vahanna and Roadzen (DE) entered into lock-up agreements (the Lock-up Agreements with the Parent Company and Roadzen (DE). Pursuant to the Lock-up Agreements, certain holders of Restricted Securities (as defined therein) have agreed, among other things, to be subject to a lock-up period which will last from the Closing until the earliest of (x) the one (1) year anniversary of consummation of the Business Combination, (y) the date that the closing price of Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share recapitalizations, subdivisions, reorganizations and the like), for twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period at least 150 days following the Closing of the Business Combination, and (z) the consummation of a liquidation, merger, capital share exchange, reorganization, tender or exchange offer as the first step of a two-step transaction or other similar transaction that results in all of the Parent Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in the Parent Company for cash, securities or other property; provided, however, that the restrictions on transfers shall not apply to the Permitted Transfers (as defined in the Lock-up Agreements); and provided further that equityholders of Roadzen (DE) that held less than 5 of the equity securities of Roadzen (DE) (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to the Closing will be permitted to transfer and/or sell up to 25 of their Restricted Securities (on an fully diluted basis when aggregated with all other Restricted Securities held by such equityholder) following the six (6) month anniversary of the date of the Closing of the Business Combination. We estimate that approximately 3,564,130 Ordinary Shares of the Company will be released from the Lock-up Agreements on March 20, 2024. 

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 39 

We provide access to our IaaS solutions through contractual agreements with our customers, whereby the customer receives one or a bundle of our solutions, which can include inspection, claims management, RSA, and/or telematics offerings. The average contract length for our IaaS customers is approximately three years. Our clients pay us on a fixed fee per-incident or per-vehicle. Our brokerage revenues are based on commissions and fees that we receive from our insurance partners for selling their policies to customers as well as providing other client services such as claims management. Our commissions and fees are calculated as a percentage of the GWP underwritten for each policy. 
 
 Cost of Services 
 The cost of services for distribution business includes commissions paid to the point-of-sale person, cost of employees and other direct expenses related to facilities. 
 For our IaaS platform, cost of services primarily consists of direct costs involved in delivering the services to the customers, including external provider cost for inspections and RSA, as well as additional costs such as employee benefit expenses. Costs forming part of cost of revenue are recognized as incurred. 
 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development costs consist primarily of employee-related costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and other expenses. It also includes the cost of annotating data pipelines for AI, the cost of building and maintaining our own AI servers for training and the cloud costs for production deployments. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily include expenditures related to advertising, channel partner incentives, media, promotional and bundling costs, brand awareness activities, business development, corporate partnerships and allocated overhead costs. These expenses are a reflection of our efforts to expand our market reach for distributing insurance policies. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of employee-related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing activities, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. 
 We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase the awareness of end customers about our products. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. While we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long-term, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for executive, finance, legal, human resources, IT, and facilities personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, and allocated overhead costs. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth as well as due to additional costs associated with legal, accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other costs as we operate as a public company. While we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long-term, our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization reflects the recognition of the cost of our tangible and intangible assets over their useful life. Depreciation expenses relate to equipment, hardware and purchased software. Amortization relates to investments related to recent acquisitions, internal software development and investments made in intellectual property development. Depreciation and amortization are expected to increase slightly in dollar amount over time but will likely decrease as a percentage of revenue as investments in platform technology reach scale. 
 
 Fair Value Changes in Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value 
 Our outstanding notes and warrants are financial liabilities measured at fair value with fair value changes recognized in profit or loss. We carry out a periodic fair valuation exercise and recognize the increase or decrease in the carrying values of these financial instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such fair value changes are primarily driven by changes in our equity value, risk free interest rates and credit risk premia. 
 
 40 

Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with definite life 
 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles can arise from various factors, including economic fluctuations, industry changes, technological advancements, and evolving customer preferences. When the carrying value of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, impairment occurs, leading to a decrease in reported value on our financial statements. Recognizing and addressing impairment in a timely and effective manner is essential. Regular assessments and impairment tests are necessary to identify potential impairments and determine the recoverable amount of these assets. 
 
 Income Tax Expense/(Benefit) 
 Income tax expense/(benefit) consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 12.3 million representing 372 growth for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of GIM and NAC which closed during June 2023, which accounted for 9 million in revenue growth in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 3.1 million of revenue growth from the addition of new clients and market outreach. 
 
 Revenue increased by 28.2 million representing 329 growth for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily attributed to the above-referenced acquisitions of GIM and NAC which accounted for 20.8 million in revenue growth for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, and the acquisition of FAP which closed in July 2023 and accounted for 0.8 million of revenue growth in the nine months ended December 31, 2023, as well as 6.3 million in revenue growth in the nine months ended December 31, 2023 from the addition of new clients and market outreach. 
 
 Our organic revenue growth of 3.1 million and 6.3 million for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year, reflects a 92 and 83 increase, respectively, over the same periods in the previous year, driven primarily by the uptick in demand for our core products attributable to our strategic marketing initiatives and the expansion of our distribution network, which have allowed us to reach new customer segments and improve product penetration in established markets. 
 
 Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 
 
 Cost of revenue increased by 5.3 million representing a 351 increase for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the acquisitions of GIM and NAC adding 3.0 million of additional costs, and 2.3 million of additional costs associated with our organic revenue growth. 
 
 Cost of revenue increased by 11.3 million representing a 256 increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the acquisitions of GIM and NAC adding 7.6 million of additional costs, and the acquisition of FAP adding 0.6 million of additional costs, as well as 3.1 million of additional costs associated with our organic revenue growth. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by 1.36 million representing a 261 increase for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the non-cash compensation expense of 1.4 million related to RSU grants. 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by 1.27 million representing a 71 increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the non-cash compensation expense of 1.5 million related to RSU grants, partially offset by decreases in technology personnel costs. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 8.0 million representing a 260 increase for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily attributed to the acquisitions of GIM and NAC adding 5.4 million of sales and marketing expenses, 2.5 million of non-cash compensation expense related to RSU grants, as well as 0.1 million of additional sales and marketing expenses related to our organic growth in revenue for the period. 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased by 17.4 million representing a 240 increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the acquisitions of GIM, NAC and FAP adding 11.9 million of sales and marketing expenses, 2.8 million of non-cash compensation expense related to RSU grants, as well as 2.7 million of additional sales and marketing expenses related to our organic revenue growth. 
 
 General and administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses ("G A") increased by 25.8 million representing a 2998 increase for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to 23.3 million of non-cash expense related to RSU grants, 1.07 million from the acquisitions of GIM and NAC, 0.5 million related to D O insurance premiums and 0.4 million from non-cash board compensation accruals. 
 
 43 

G A increased by 32.9 million representing a 1666 increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to 26.3 million non-cash expense related to RSU grants, 2.2 million from the acquisitions of GIM and NAC, 2.0 million due to employee-related expenses resulting from increased headcount, other costs related to the Business Combination, 1.5 million of legal costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions of GIM, NAC and capital raising initiatives, 0.5 million related to D O insurance premiums, and 0.4 million from non-cash board compensation accruals. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 0.07 million representing a 13 decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased by 0.06 million representing a 5 decrease for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022. 
 
 Interest Income (Expense) 
 
 Interest expense increased by 0.3 million representing a 81 increase for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in borrowings from banks and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible debentures. 
 
 Interest expense increased by 1.0 million representing a 158 increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in borrowings from banks and the issuance of non-convertible debentures. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) and Fair Value Changes in Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value 
 
 Gain on fair valuation changes decreased by 2.8 million representing a 70 decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to the fair valuation of our Forward Purchase Agreement. 
 
 Loss on fair valuation changes increased by 21.4 million representing 2116 increase for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to the fair valuation losses of our Forward Purchase Agreement and convertible promissory notes and share warrants. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of finance costs, taxes, depreciation amortization and certain other items from reported net profit or loss. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA aids investors by providing an operating profit/loss without the impact of non-cash depreciation amortization and certain other items to help clarify sustainability and trends affecting the business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 The following table reconciles our net loss reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Limitations and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under U.S. GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. These limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our founding, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity, convertible instruments, debt (including working capital lines), and payments received from our customers. As of December 31, 2023, we have raised an aggregate of 42.2 million, net of issuance costs, through the issuance of preferred stock and a convertible debenture. We have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of (117.0) million and (51.4) million as of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023 respectively inclusive of fair valuation losses and transaction costs arising from the Business Combination. We anticipate that we will continue to experience operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations over an extended period due to the planned investments in our business. Consequently, we may need to secure additional capital resources to support the execution of our strategic initiatives for growing our business in the coming years. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents with closing balances of 9.4 million and 0.6 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and deposit with banks with an original maturity of three months or less. 
 
 45 

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers, the continued market acceptance of our solutions, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Operating Activities 
 
 Our largest sources of cash provided by operations are increases in accounts payables and payments received from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include employee-related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, third-party cloud infrastructure expenses and other overhead costs. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 14.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 7.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This consisted of a net loss of 65.8 million and net cash outflows of 4.0 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and partially offset by non-cash charge add-backs of 55.3 million. The non-cash charges were primarily comprised of fair valuation losses of 22.4 million, stock based compensation of 30.8 million and depreciation/amortization of 1.2 million. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased from 7.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 to 14.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in receivables and payables due to the acquisitions of NAC and GIM and Forward Purchase Agreement. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 6.7 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of 5.7 million for the acquisitions of GIM and NAC, 0.5 million consisting of an investment made in a mutual fund (held for sale), and 0.4 million of capital expenditures for additional office facilities. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 0.3 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which primarily consisted of capital expenditures or additional office facilities. 
 
 46 

Financing Activities 
 
 We have generated negative cash flows from operations since our inception and have supplemented working capital through net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt and preferred equity securities. Cash provided by financing activities was 18.6 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of 6.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and 12.5 million of loans from banks and other parties. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 8.2 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, which primarily consisted of loans from banks and other parties.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 
 We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
 The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, the Company will not be subject to the same implementation timeline for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of the Company s financial statements to those of other public companies more difficult. 
 48 

Net Income (Loss) per Ordinary Share 
 The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. 
 The calculation of diluted income per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the Company's outstanding warrants since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted net income per ordinary share is the same as basic net income per ordinary share for the periods presented. 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 ITEM 3. Quantit ative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 ITEM 4. C ontrols and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PA RT II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGA L PROCEEDINGS. 
 From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 
 IT EM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus we filed with the SEC on August 14, 2023 which are incorporated herein by reference. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 Recent actions by the FCA could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The FCA has recently conducted a comprehensive review of the Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) product, a key contributor to our operations in the UK, resulting in a directive for all insurers, including our insurance partner, to temporarily cease selling the GAP product in February 2024. The regulator has mandated that insurers make a resubmission, or new GAP proposal, outlining the product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP product can be resumed. 
 
 As our insurance partner is obligated to adhere to FCA guidelines, any delay or challenges in them obtaining FCA approval of their resubmission may have a negative impact on our business. The resubmission process introduces uncertainty, as there is no guarantee of swift regulatory approval. The temporary suspension of GAP sales may have a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall profitability. We are actively working with our insurance partner to address the concerns raised by the regulator, expedite the resubmission process, and seek timely FCA approval to resume GAP sales, however, there can be no assurance that the resubmission will receive prompt regulatory approval. Delays in obtaining approval may result in prolonged disruption to our business operations, potential reputational damage, and potential loss of clients and customer confidence. Additionally, the resubmission process may require adjustments to the GAP product, potentially increasing our costs and decreasing our profit margin and any delays or unfavorable outcomes may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
