SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

PART I 

Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Such
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, statements regarding our business strategy,
future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses. Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including
the words "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "believes" and similar language. Our actual
results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to, our business reliance on third parties to provide us with technology, our ability
to integrate and manage acquired technology, assets, companies and personnel, changes in market condition, the volatile and intensely
competitive environment in the business sectors in which we operate, rapid technological change, and our dependence on key and scarce
employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel. These factors should not be considered exhaustive; we undertake no obligation
to release publicly the results of any future revisions we may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, as well as those discussed in the section "Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any
revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances taking place after the date of this document. 

Item 1. Business. 

Business 

Gold Rock Holdings, Inc., (Gold Rock) a Nevada corporation, is a holding
company that acquires technological assets. 

The Company changed its business model from engineering and construction
management services, as a result of a change in control on October 2, 2023. Gold Rock intends to grow and further establish itself through
mergers, acquisition and management of technological assets. As such, Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. (the "Company")announced on December
12, 2023, that it formed a Wyoming corporation by the name of Loot8, Inc. as its operating wholly-owned subsidiary. Loot 8, Inc. acquired
certain intellectual property known as Loot8. Loot8 is a Web3 Commerce and Content Management Engine Software. At its core, it harnesses
the power of multiple public blockchains alongside the IPFS file system, with a user-friendly interface akin to Web2. Loot8 is engineered
to cater to a variety of enterprise necessities including digital product passports, private communication channels, and loyalty programs,
among others. Loot8 provides enterprises the capability to oversee and manage their content on IPFS nodes, leveraging AI to make the underlying
content interactive as a way to enable small businesses and content creators to scale at a faster pace and to create differentiated experiences. 

Loot8, Inc. currently is in the beta testing phase of its business
and has no revenue. However, it has developed a Web3 content management system (CMS) pioneering the Relationship Economy 
through SocialFi, and a new monetization model. This model is designed to empower individuals with compelling stories to monetize their
relationships beyond traditional influencer models. 

The new monetization model is made up of three discrete revenue streams.
It is planned that the first stream will be a direct-to-consumer (D2C) model where Loot8 will employ Web3 technology to manage memorabilia
and fan engagement. Key initiatives include a partnership with Perpetual Sports for athletes' Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights,
and revenue generation through a 10 transaction fee on subscriptions and digital collectible sales. The model also includes a collaboration
with LBX Food Robotics for vending machines at universities and other venues, which serve as sales points for digital memorabilia, and
the integration of APPIX for real-time notifications on collectible availability. The second revenue stream we anticipate will target
the youth market. Loot8 has partnered with KIPP Charter Schools to introduce customizable AI avatars and companions. This feature is expected
to contribute to revenue through a 10 transaction fee on cosmetic items for AI companions , while maintaining these digital assets
on Loot8 s platform. The third stream anticipated will make use of an enterprise model that will leverage Marcus Daley, GRHI s
CEO, background with NeuralMetrics and towards Software as a Service (SaaS) licensing and advertising-driven models. The Company plans
to focus on Annual Contract Value (ACV) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from corporate clients. This will allow the Company to address
enterprise needs in digital product passport regulations in Europe and similar use-cases globally. 

This acquisition is part of GRHI's management s plan to change
its business model to more fully develop and utilize the Loot8 platform, focusing on AI and blockchain innovation in digital assets, the
SocialFi revolution, and expanding into direct-to-business relationships. 

Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. maintains an executive office in Virginia
Beach, Virginia where all marketing, sales, and customer supports activities are implemented.

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

Our common stock has been traded on the OTCMARKETS since April 15,

As of December 31, 2023, we were authorized to issue 850,000,000 shares,
 0.001 par value, of our common stock, of which 231,053,636 shares were outstanding. Our shares of common stock are held by approximately
157 stockholders of record. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include
beneficial owners of our common stock whose shares are held in the names of various securities brokers, dealers, and registered clearing
agencies. 

Preferred Stock 

We are authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of our preferred
stock, par value 0.001 per share, from time to time in one or more series. As of the date of this prospectus, no shares of preferred
stock have been issued. Our Board of Directors, without further approval of our stockholders, is authorized to fix the dividend rights
and terms, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidation preferences and other rights and restrictions relating to
any series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. 

On January 11, 2024, the board of directors adopted a resolution designating
20,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each of these shares has a par value of 0.001, is not entitled to dividends, has voting
rights equal to 25 common votes per share, has the same liquidation rights as common and are not convertible. After this designation,
the Company still has 30,000,000 blank check preferred stock, par value, 0.001 per share available for designation. The Company has no
preferred shares issued and outstanding at this time. 

Issuances of shares of preferred stock, while providing flexibility
in connection with possible financings, acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, adversely affect the voting
power of the holders of our common stock and prior series of preferred stock then outstanding. 

Dividends 

We have not paid or declared any dividends on our common stock, nor
do we anticipate paying any cash dividends or other distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future dividends
will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, on our earnings, if any, our financial
requirements for future operations and growth, and other facts as our board of directors may then deem appropriate. 

ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. 

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE INFORMATION
CONTAINED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. 

- 3 - 

The following discussion reflects the results of our operations. This
discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which are attached to this report. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expected financial position, business and financing plans. These
statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied
by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly
under the headings "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 

Unless the context otherwise suggests, "we," "our,"
"us," and similar terms, as well as references to "GRHI" or "Gold Rock " all refer to Gold Rock Holdings,
Inc. as of the date of this report. 

Going Concern 

On December 31, 2023, we had total assets of 108 and total liabilities
of 9,900. In the absence of significant revenue and profits, we will be completely dependent on additional debt and equity financing. If
we are unable to raise needed funds on acceptable terms, we will not be able to execute our business plan, develop or enhance existing
services, take advantage of future opportunities, if any, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. If we do
not obtain sufficient capital, we will not be able to continue operations. 

As of December 31, 2023, Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. had an accumulated
deficit of 866,037, which included a net loss of 232,311. Also, during the year ended December 31 2023, we used net cash of 22,586
for operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

While we are attempting to generate revenues, our cash position may
not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of
our debt or equity securities (See Item 9B- Other Information; Subsequent Events). Management believes that the actions presently
being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. to continue
as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional
funds, we may not be successful. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability
to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. 

Results of Operations 

Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December
31, 2022. 

Revenues for the Company's year ended December 31, 2023 and December
31, 2022 totaled -0- from no sales. 

Cost of Goods Sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December
31, 2023 totaled -0-; no sales 

Gross margins for year ended December 2023 and 2022 was -0- due to
the Company having no sales. 

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was -0-
due to -0- sales. 

General and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31,
2023 totaled 50,311 compared to 41,682 for December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in professional service fees. 

Total Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled
 232,311 compared to 434,182 for December 31, 2022. Board of Director fees were 170,000for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 30,000
for the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was from new Board of Directors compensation
agreement. Consulting Fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 were 12,000 compared to 362,500 in December 31, 2022. The decrease
was due to less accrued consulting expenses. 

Net Loss 

Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 232,311
and 434,182, respectively. The decrease in loss was due to decrease in consulting fees. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources: 

As of December 31, 2023, our assets totaled 108 in Cash. The Company's
total liabilities were 9,900 which consisted of accounts payable and accrued expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of 866,037 and working capital deficit of 9,792. 

The Company's significant operating losses raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation of our business plan, and we will need
additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time.
 Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially
change its methods of operations or change its business plan. For the next 12 months the Company has an oral commitment from its CEO,
Marcus Daley, to advance funds as necessary to meeting our operating requirement. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 0 for both calendar years
ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. 

Cash from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 21,410 for year ended
December 31, 2023, and was 39,876 for year ended December 31, 2022.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates
and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition
and impairment of long-lived assets. 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
("ASC 606"), revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle,
we apply the following five steps: 1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize
revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

We adopted this ASC on January 1, 2021. Although the new revenue standard
is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue
recognition and the control activities within them. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation in
accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based
payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value
of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during
which services are rendered. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that
are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements, including revenue recognition. The Company does not
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

The financial statements and related notes are included as part of

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the Chief Operating Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer),
we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The
Disclosure Controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Operating
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed
to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Operating
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The evaluation of our Disclosure Controls included a review of the
controls objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated
for use in this Form 10-K. Throughout the course of our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, we advised our Board
of Directors that we had identified a material weakness as defined under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness we identified is discussed in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting below. Our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as a result of the material
weakness, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Disclosure Controls were not effective. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting; as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. 

Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management, including our principal operating officer and principal
accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. 

Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that there is a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness identified did not result in the restatement of any previously
reported financial statements or any related financial disclosure, nor does management believe that it had any effect on the accuracy
of the Company s financial statements for the current reporting period. 

The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its
cash disbursement control design. 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company internally
performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including, but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording
of journal entries and for the preparation of financial statements. This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often
times by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure
to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed
with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected. 

The Company is continuing the process of remediating its control
deficiencies. However, the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that has been identified will not be remediated
until numerous internal controls are implemented and operate for a period of time, are tested, and the Company is able to conclude that
such internal controls are operating effectively. The Company cannot provide assurance that these procedures will be successful in identifying
material errors that may exist in the financial statements. The Company cannot make assurances that it will not identify additional material
weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting in the future. Management plans, as capital becomes available to the Company,
to increase the accounting and financial reporting staff and provide future investments in the continuing education and public company
accounting training of our accounting and financial professionals. 

- 6 - 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that: 

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors, and; 

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

Management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this
assessment, management used the May 2013 updated criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies. 

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design
of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent
limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

Because of the material weakness described above, management concluded
that, as of December 31, 2023 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. There has been no change in our internal controls that occurred during our most recent fiscal
period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal controls. 

In May 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission ("COSO") released an updated version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework ("2013 Framework"),
Initially issued in 1992, the original framework ("1992 Framework") provided guidance to organizations to design, implement
and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control concepts and simplify their use and application. The 2013 Framework is intended to
improve upon systems of internal control over external financial reporting by formalizing the principles embedded in the 1992 Framework,
incorporating business and operating environment changes and increasing the framework ease of use and application. The 1992 Framework
remained available until December 15, 2014, after which it was superseded by the 2013 Framework. The Company did not experience significant
changes to its internal control over financial reporting as a result of the transition to the 2013 Framework. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s
registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation
by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit smaller reporting companies like us
to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

This report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section
18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference
into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such
filing. 

No changes have occurred in the Company s internal controls over
financial reporting during the Company s last fiscal quarter, which has materially affected or is likely to affect such controls.

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses
from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these
matters are also described in Note 4. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. 

We determined that there are no critical audit matters.
