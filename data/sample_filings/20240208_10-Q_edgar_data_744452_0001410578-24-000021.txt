In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and our management and other representatives may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. These statements relate to future events or to our future operating or financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they: discuss our future expectations; contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition; and state other forward-looking information. 
 We believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However, forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our business and our industry and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Accordingly, our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors and risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report, those set forth from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as amended, and the following factors and risks: our expectations of future revenues, expenditures, capital or other funding requirements; the adequacy of our cash and working capital to fund present and planned operations and growth; the substantial doubt relating to our ability to continue as a going concern; our need for additional financing which may in turn require the issuance of additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or other debt or equity securities (including convertible securities) which would dilute the ownership held by stockholders; our business strategy and the timing of our expansion plans, including the development of new production facilities for our Therapeutic DNA Production Services; demand for Therapeutic DNA Production Services; demand for DNA Tagging Services; demand for MDx Testing Services, including in light of significantly decreasing demand for COVID testing services;

Introduction We are a biotechnology company developing and commercializing technologies to produce and detect DNA and RNA. Using PCR to enable the production and detection of DNA and RNA, we currently operate in three primary business markets: (i) the enzymatic manufacture of synthetic DNA for use in the production of nucleic acid-based therapeutics (including biologics and drugs) and, through our recent acquisition of Spindle, the development and sale of a proprietary RNAP for use in the production of mRNA, all under our Therapeutic DNA Production Services; (ii) the detection of DNA and RNA in molecular diagnostics and genetic testing services under our MDx Testing Services; and (iii) the manufacture and detection of DNA to facilitate supply chance security under our Tagging and Security Products and Services. Our current growth strategy is to primarily focus our resources on the further development, commercialization, and customer adoption of our Therapeutic DNA Production Services, including the expansion of our contract development and manufacturing operation CDMO for the manufacture of synthetic DNA for use in the production of nucleic acid-based therapies, and to further expand and commercialize our MDx Testing Services through genetic testing. We will continue to update our business strategy and monitor the use of our resources regarding our various business markets. In addition, we expect that based on available opportunities and our beliefs regarding future opportunities, we will continue to modify and refine our business strategy. Therapeutic DNA Production Services Through LRx we are developing and commercializing our Linea DNA and Linea IVT platforms. Linea DNA Platform Our Linea DNA platform is our core enabling technology, and enables the rapid, efficient, and large-scale cell-free manufacture of high-fidelity DNA sequences for use in the manufacturing of a broad range of nucleic acid-based therapeutics. The Linea DNA platform enzymatically produces a linear form of DNA we call LineaDNA that is an alternative to plasmid-based DNA manufacturing technologies that have supplied the DNA used in biotherapeutics for the past 40 years. As of the fourth quarter of calendar year 2023, there were 3,951 gene, cell and RNA therapies in development from preclinical through pre-registration stages, almost all of which use DNA in their manufacturing process. (Source: ASGCT Gene, Cell RNA Therapy Landscape: Q4 2023 Quarterly Report). Due to what we believe are the Linea DNA platform s numerous advantages over legacy nucleic acid-based therapeutic manufacturing platforms, we believe this large number of therapies under development represents a substantial market opportunity for the Linea DNA platform to supplant legacy manufacturing methods in the manufacture of nucleic acid-based therapies.

 We believe our Linea DNA platform holds several important advantages over existing cell-based plasmid DNA manufacturing platforms. Plasmid-based DNA manufacturing is based on the complex, costly and time-consuming biological process of amplifying DNA in living bacterial cells. Once amplified, the DNA must be separated from the living cells and other process contaminants via multiple rounds of purification, adding further complexity and costs. Unlike plasmid-based DNA manufacturing, the Linea DNA platform does not require living cells and instead amplifies DNA via the enzymatic process of PCR. The Linea DNA platform is simple and can rapidly produce very large quantities of DNA without the need for complex purification steps. We believe the key advantages of the Linea DNA platform include: Speed Production of Linea DNA can be measured in terms of hours, not days and weeks as is the case with plasmid-based DNA manufacturing platforms. Scalability Linea DNA production takes place on efficient bench-top instruments, allowing for rapid scalability in a minimal footprint. Purity DNA produced via PCR is pure, resulting in only large quantities of only the target DNA sequence. Unwanted DNA sequences such as the plasmid backbone and antibiotic resistance genes, inherent to plasmid DNA, are not present in Linea DNA. Simplicity The production of Linea DNA is streamlined relative to plasmid-based DNA production. Linea DNA requires only four primary ingredients, does not require living cells or complex fermentation systems and does not require multiple rounds of purification. Flexibility DNA produced via the Linea DNA platform can be easily chemically modified to suit specific customer applications. In addition, the Linea DNA platform can produce a wide range of complex DNA sequences that are difficult to produce via plasmid-based DNA production platforms. These complex sequences include inverted terminal repeats ITRs and long homopolymers such as polyadenylation sequences (poly (A) tail) important for gene therapy and mRNA therapies, respectively. 
 Preclinical studies conducted by the Company have shown that Linea DNA is substitutable for plasmid DNA in numerous nucleic acid-based therapies, including: DNA vaccines; DNA templates to produce RNA, including mRNA therapeutics; and adoptive cell therapy (CAR-T) manufacturing. 
 Further, we believe that Linea DNA is also substitutable for plasmid DNA in the following nucleic acid-based therapies: viral vector manufacturing for in vivo and ex vivo gene editing; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats CRISPR )-mediated gene therapy; and non-viral gene therapy. 
 Linea IVT Platform The number of mRNA therapies under development is growing at a rapid rate, thanks in part to the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. mRNA therapeutics are produced via a process called in vitro transcription IVT that requires DNA as a starting material. As of the 4 th quarter of calendar 2023, there were almost 425 mRNA therapies under development, with the large majority of these therapies (67 in the preclinical stage (Source: ASGCT Gene, Cell RNA Therapy Landscape: Q4 2023 Quarterly Report). The Company believes that the mRNA market is in a nascent stage that represents a large growth opportunity for the Company via the production and supply of DNA critical starting materials and RNAP to produce mRNA therapies.

Table of Contents 
 In August 2022, the Company launched DNA IVT templates manufactured via its Linea DNA platform and has since secured proof of concept contracts with numerous mRNA manufacturing customers. In response to this demand, the continued growth of the mRNA therapeutic market, and the unique abilities of the Linea DNA platform, the Company acquired Spindle in July 2023 to potentially increase its mRNA-related total addressable market TAM ). Through our acquisition of Spindle, we recently launched our Linea IVT platform, which combines Spindle s proprietary high-performance RNAP, now marketed by the Company as Linea RNAP, with our enzymatically produced Linea DNA IVT templates. We believe the Linea IVT platform enables our customers to make better mRNA, faster. Based on data generated by the Company, we believe the integrated Linea IVT platform offers the following advantages over conventional mRNA production to therapy developers and manufacturers: The prevention or reduction of double stranded RNA dsRNA contamination resulting in higher target mRNA yields with the potential to reduce downstream processing steps. dsRNA is a problematic immunogenic byproduct produced during conventional mRNA manufacture; delivery of IVT templates in as little as 14 days for milligram scale and 30 days for gram scale; and reduced mRNA manufacturing complexities. 
 According to the Company s internal modeling, the ability to sell both Linea DNA IVT templates and Linea RNAP under the Linea IVT platform potentially increases the Company s mRNA-related TAM by approximately 3x as compared to selling Linea DNA IVT templates alone, while also providing a more competitive offering to the mRNA manufacturing market. Currently, Linea RNAP is produced for the Company by a third-party CDMO located in the United States. Manufacturing Scale-up The Company plans to offer several quality grades of Linea DNA, each of which will have different permitted uses. Quality Grade Permitted Use Company Status GLP Research and pre-clinical discovery Currently available GMP for Starting Materials DNA critical starting materials for the production of mRNA therapies Planned availability first half of CY2024 GMP DNA biologic, drug substance and/or drug product Planned availability first half of CY 2025 (1) 
 (1) Dependent on the availability of future financing. The Company currently manufactures Linea DNA pursuant to Good Laboratory Practices GLP and, is creating a fit for purpose manufacturing facility within our current Stony Brook, NY laboratory space capable of producing Linea DNA IVT templates under Good Manufacturing Practices GMP suitable for use as a critical starting material for clinical and commercial mRNA therapeutics, with a planned completion date in the first half of calendar year 2024. The Company also plans to offer Linea DNA materials manufactured under GMP suitable for use as, or incorporation into, a biologic, drug substance and/or drug product, with availability expected during the first half of calendar year 2025, dependent upon the availability of future funding. GMP is a quality standard used globally and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA to ensure pharmaceutical quality. Drug substances are the pharmaceutically active components of drug products.

 Segment Business Strategy Our business strategy for our Therapeutic DNA Production Services is to capitalize upon the rapid growth of mRNA therapies in the near term via our planned near term future availability of Linea DNA IVT templates manufactured under GMP, while at the same time laying the basis for additional clinical and commercial applications of Linea DNA with our future planned availability of Linea DNA manufactured under GMP suitable for use as, or incorporation into, a biologic, drug substance and/or drug product. Our current plan is: (i) through our Linea IVT platform and planned near term future GMP manufacturing capabilities for IVT templates to secure commercial-scale supply contracts with clinical and commercial mRNA and/or self-amplifying mRNA sa-RNA manufacturers for Linea DNA IVT templates and/or Linea RNAP as critical starting materials; (ii) to utilize our current GLP production capacity for non-IVT template applications to secure supply and/or development contracts with pre-clinical therapy developers that use DNA in their therapy manufacturing, and (iii) upon our development of our planned future Linea DNA production under GMP suitable for use as, or incorporation into, a biologic, drug substance and/or drug product, to convert existing and new Linea DNA customers into large-scale supply contracts to supply Linea DNA for clinical and commercial use as, or incorporation into, a biologic, drug substance and/or drug product in a wide range of nucleic acid therapies. Until we complete our GMP facility to produce DNA critical starting materials (DNA IVT templates) for mRNA manufacturing, we will not be able to realize significant revenues from this business. We estimate the cost of creating the critical starting materials fit-for-purpose manufacturing facility will be approximately 1.5 million. We anticipate that the proceeds from the Offering should be sufficient to support the costs of this facility. If we were to expand the facility to enable GMP production of Linea DNA for use as, or incorporation, into a biologic, drug substance and/or drug product, the cost may be up to approximately 7 million which would require additional funding. We anticipate that the fit-for-purpose manufacturing facility would be created within our existing laboratory space. We anticipate that a facility to enable GMP production of biologic, drug substances and/or drug products would require us to acquire additional space. In addition, we plan to leverage our Therapeutic DNA Production Services and deep knowledge of PCR to develop and monetize, ourselves or with strategic partners, one or more Linea DNA-based therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines for high-value veterinary health indications (collectively Linea DNA Vaccines ). We currently seek to commercialize our Linea DNA Vaccines in conjunction with lipid nanoparticle LNP encapsulation to facilitate intramuscular IM administration. We have recently demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (mice studies) expression of generic reporter proteins via Linea DNA encapsulated by LNPs. For the in vivo study, successful expression of the LNP-encapsulated Linea DNA was administered and achieved via IM injection. We believe that our Linea DNA Vaccines under development provide a substantial advantage over plasmid DNA-based vaccines for the veterinary health market. MDx Testing Services Through ADCL, we leverage our expertise in DNA detection via PCR to provide and develop clinical molecular diagnostics and genetic (collectively MDx testing services. ADCL is a NYSDOH clinical laboratory improvement amendments -permitted, clinical laboratory improvement amendments-certified laboratory which is currently permitted for virology. Permitting for genetics (molecular) is currently pending with the NYSDOH. In providing MDx testing services, ADCL employs its own or third-party molecular diagnostic tests. We have successfully validated internally our pharmacogenomics testing services (the PGx Testing Services ). Our PGx Testing Services will utilize a 120-target PGx panel test to evaluate the unique genotype of a specific patient to help guide individual drug therapy decisions. Our PGx Testing Services are designed to interrogate DNA targets on over 33 genes and provide genotyping information relevant to certain cardiac, mental health, oncology, and pain management drug therapies. Our PGx Testing Services cannot commence until we receive approval from the NYSDOH. On March 22, 2023, we submitted our validation package to the NYSDOH for our PGx Testing Services. On September 21, 2023, we received a first set of comments from NYSDOH requesting additional data and clarifications. A response was submitted to NYSDOH on November 17, 2023. On December 26, 2023, we received a second set of comments from NYSDOH requesting additional data and clarifications. Currently, timing of any approval by NYSDOH for our PGx Testing Services is unclear. Recently published studies show that population-scale PGx enabled medication management can significantly reduce overall population healthcare costs, reduce adverse drug events, and increase overall population wellbeing. These benefits can result in significant cost savings to large entities and self-insured employers, the latter accounting for approximately 65 of all U.S. employers in 2022. If and when approved by the NYSDOH, we plan to leverage our PGx Testing Services to provide PGx testing services to large entities and self-insured employers.

 Historically, the majority of our revenue attributable to our MDx Testing Services has been derived from our safeCircle COVID-19 testing solutions, for which testing demand has significantly dropped. While we continue to support several safeCircle customers, we are currently observing a marked decrease in market demand for COVID-19 testing, resulting in significantly reduced revenues. We expect future demand for COVID-19 testing to continue to be reduced and we may terminate COVID-19 testing services in the future. DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services By leveraging our expertise in both the manufacture and detection of DNA via PCR, our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services allow our customers to use non-biologic DNA tags manufactured on our Linea DNA platform to mark objects in a unique manner and then identify these objects by detecting the absence or presence of the DNA tag. The Company s core DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services, which are marketed collectively as a platform under the trademark CertainT , include: SigNature Molecular Tags, which are short non-biologic DNA taggants produced by the Company s Linea DNA platform, provide a methodology to authenticate goods within large and complex supply chains with a focus on cotton, nutraceuticals and other products. SigNify portable DNA readers and SigNify consumable reagent test kits provide definitive real-time authentication of the Company s DNA tags in the field. fiberTyping and other product genotyping services use PCR-based DNA detection to determine a cotton species or cultivar, via a product s naturally occurring DNA sequence for the purposes of product provenance authentication. Isotopic analysis testing services, provided in partnership with third-party labs, use cotton s carbon, hydrogen and oxygen elements to indicate origin of its fiber through finished goods. 
 To date, our largest commercial application for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services is in the tracking and provenance authentication of cotton. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act UFLPA signed into law on December 23, 2021 establishes that any goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region XUAR of the People s Republic of China are not entitled to entry to the United States. On June 17, 2022, the UFLPA additionally listed DNA tagging and isotopic analysis as evidence that importers may use to potentially prove that a good did not originate in XUAR. Our business plan is to leverage growing consumer and governmental awareness for product traceability catalyzed by the UFLPA to expand our existing partnerships and seek new partnerships for our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services with a focus on cotton. Plan of Operations General Historically, a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from our safeCircle COVID-19 testing solutions, for which testing demand has significantly dropped. While we continue to support several safeCircle customers, we are currently observing a marked decrease in market demand for COVID-19 testing, resulting in significantly reduced revenues. We expect future demand for COVID-19 testing to continue to be reduced. We expect future growth in revenues to be derived from our Therapeutic DNA Production Services and our MDx testing services, as the latter transitions to a focus on genetic testing. To a lesser extent, we expect to grow revenues our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services offerings as we work with companies and governments to secure supply chains for various types of products and product labeling throughout the world with a focus on cotton provenance. We have continued to incur expenses in expanding our business to meet current and anticipated future demand. We have limited sources of liquidity. We will continue to update our business strategy and monitor the use of our resources regarding our various business markets. In addition, we expect that based on available opportunities and our beliefs regarding future opportunities, we will continue to modify and refine our business strategy.

 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three-Month Periods Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Revenues Product revenues For the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated 307,317 and 516,396 in revenues from product sales, respectively. Product revenue decreased by 209,079 or 40 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in product revenues was primarily related to a decrease of approximately 127,000 w ithin our Therapeutic DNA Production Services segment for large scale DNA production. Shipments under the related contract are expected to commence again during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Additional decreases were 92,000 in our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segment due to a decline in cotton DNA tagging revenue. Service Revenues For the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated 247,147 and 232,061 in revenues from sales of services, respectively. The increase in service revenues of 15,086 or 7 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year is attributable to increases of 98,000 for isotopic testing for textiles within our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segment offset by decreases of 45,000 for research and development projects in our Therapeutic DNA Production Services segment as well as approximately 29,000 in our DNA Tagging and Security Products and Services segment. Clinical Laboratory Service Revenues For the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we generated 336,700 and 4,514,295 in revenues from our clinical laboratory testing services, respectively. The decrease in service revenues of 4,177,595 or 93 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year is attributable to a decrease from COVID surveillance testing. The three-months ended December 31, 2022 included testing revenues under our contract with CUNY, which terminated during June 2023.

 Cost and Expenses Gross Profit Gross profit for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, decreased by 2,146,586 or 90 from 2,377,683 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 to 231,097. The gross profit percentage was 26 and 45 for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of a decline in gross profit percentage for our MDx testing services segment specifically related to decreased testing volumes year over year. To a lesser extent, the decline in gross profit percentage was due to lower product revenues during the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The lower volume of product revenues in the current period were not able to fully absorb the fixed costs that are included in cost of product revenues. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 increased by 458,991 or 17 to 3,084,348 as compared to 2,625,357 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. The increase relates to the prior three-month period having a credit balance in bad debt expense of approximately 290,000, from a customer balance that was fully reserved during a prior period and was subsequently collected during the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. The remainder of the increase is attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of 247,000. The increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to the timing of the annual non-employee board of director grant that vests one-year from the date of grant, which was granted during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. These increases were offset by a decrease in payroll of approximately 107,000 . Research and Development Research and development expenses decreased to 935,815 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 from 971,304 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 35,489 or 4 . This decrease is primarily due to decreased depreciation expense costs for the three-month period December 31, 2023 associated with laboratory equipment becoming fully depreciated year over year. Interest income Interest income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 increased to 33,323 as compared to 3,686 in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. Other (expense) income, net Other (expense) income for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was expense of 13,538 and income of 8,846, respectively. Unrealized gain (loss) on change in fair value of warrants classified as a liability Unrealized gain (loss) on change in fair value of Common Warrants for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was a gain of 2,639,000 and a loss of 2,637,800, respectively relates to the change in fair value of the warrants that are classified as a liability. The primary driver of the change is the decrease in our stock price, as well as the Series B Warrants expiring during September 2023. Loss from operations Loss from operations increased 2,570,088, or 211 to 3,789,066 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to 1,218,978 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 due to the factors noted above.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity needs consist of our working capital requirements and research and development expenditure funding. As of December 31, 2023, we had working capital of 2,002,107. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, we used cash in operating activities of 3,757,679 consisting primarily of our loss of 1,130,281 net with non-cash adjustments of 298,951 in depreciation and amortization charges, 2,639,000 in unrealized gain on change in fair value of warrants classified as a liability, and 340,705 in stock-based compensation expense. Additionally, we had a net increase in operating assets of 256,230 and a net decrease in operating liabilities of 371,824. At December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3,359,045. We have recurring net losses. We incurred a net loss of 1,130,281 and generated negative operating cash flow of 3,757,679 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to further implement our business plan, raise capital, and generate revenues. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Our current capital resources include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and inventories. Historically, we have financed our operations principally from the sale of equity and equity-linked securities. As discussed in Note J, on February 2, 2024, we closed on a registered direct public offering and received gross proceeds from the Offering, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, of approximately 3.4 million. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. We believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows: Revenue recognition; and Warrant Liabilities 
 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The most critical estimates include recoverability of long-lived assets, including the values assigned to intangible assets, fair value calculations for warrants, and contingencies. Management reviews its estimates on a regular basis and the effects of any material revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed necessary. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition We follow FASB issued accounting standard updates which clarify the principles for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers ASC 606 or Topic 606 ).

Table of Contents 
 The Company measures revenue at the amounts that reflect the consideration to which it is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of goods and services to customers. The Company recognizes revenue either at the point in time or over the period of time that performance obligations to customers are satisfied. The Company s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations (e.g. taggants, maintenance, authentication services, research and development services, etc.). For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenues to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price. Due to the short-term nature of the Company s contracts with customers, it has elected to apply the practical expedients under Topic 606 to: (1) expense as incurred, incremental costs of obtaining a contract and (2) not adjust the consideration for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Product Revenues and Authentication Services The Company s PCR-produced linear DNA product revenues are accounted for/recognized in accordance with contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue upon satisfying its promises to transfer goods or services to customers under the terms of its contracts. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer. The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms. The Company invoices customers upon shipment, and its collection terms range, on average, from 30 to 60 days. Authentication Services The Company recognizes revenue for authentication services upon satisfying its promises to provide services to customers under the terms of its contracts. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company services are complete, which in nearly all cases is when the authentication report is released to the customer. Clinical Laboratory Testing Services The Company records revenue for its clinical laboratory testing service contracts, which includes its COVID-19 Testing Services, upon satisfying its promise to provide services to customers under the terms of its contracts. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time that Company services are complete, which in nearly all cases is when the testing results are released to the customer. For those customers with a fixed monthly fee, the revenue is recognized over-time as the services are provided. Research and Development Services The Company records revenue for its research and development contracts using the over-time revenue recognition model. Revenue is primarily measured using the cost-to-cost method, which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs expected upon satisfying the identified performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. For contracts where the total costs cannot be estimated, revenues are recognized for the actual costs incurred during a period until the remaining costs to complete a contract can be estimated. The Company has elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Warrant Liabilities The Company evaluated the Common Warrants and the Series A and Series B Warrants (collectively the Warrants in accordance with ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity and concluded that due to the terms of the warrant agreements, the instrument does not qualify for equity treatment. As such, the Warrants were recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of change.
