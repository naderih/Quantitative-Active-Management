NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER 30, 2023

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION

Organization and Business

Global Arena Holding, Inc. (formerly, Global Arena Holding Subsidiary Corp. ( GAHI ), was formed in February 2009, in the state of Delaware. GAHI and its subsidiaries (the Company was previously a financial services firm and currently is focusing on the following businesses through these subsidiaries:

On February 25, 2015, Global Election Services, Inc. (GES) formed on February 25, 2015, provides comprehensive technology-enabled paper absentee/mail ballot and internet election services to organizations such as craft and trade organizations, labor unions, political parties, co-operatives and housing organizations, associations and professional societies, universities, and political organizations. 

GES has developed proprietary election software for a data storage and retrieval registration system to determine voter eligibility and prevent duplicate votes with In-Person digital signature capture, as well as proprietary election software for scanning/tabulation utilizing advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode imaging software featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. This system provides three types of audit capabilities. The hardware includes high speed optical scanners that are hard lined to a computer with all Wi-Fi disabled so the entire tabulation utilizing process occurs offline, eliminating the opportunity for hacking. GES is also working with multiple vendors and has made investments in companies that are developing Blockchain Technology for a data storage and retrieval registration system, tabulation of paper Absentee/Mail Ballots; and internet voting.

On March 25, 2021, the Company entered into a second amended purchase agreement (APA) with Election Services Solutions. Under the second APA the Company entered into an amended asset purchase agreement with Election Services Solutions, LLC. Under the amended APA, the Company will purchase 100 of the assets of Election Services Solutions, LLC and the Company will pay 650,000, of which 511,150 has already been paid, and issue 40,000,000 common shares to purchase these assets under this second amended APA. This APA replaces the first amended purchase agreement signed on May 10, 2019 wherein the Company was to purchase 100 of the assets of Election Services Solutions, LLC. The Company was to pay 550,000, of which 511,150 has already been paid, and issue 20,000,000 common shares to purchase these assets under this first amended APA. GES derives over 80 of its current business from Election Services Solutions. Management anticipates the closing of this transaction will occur in the first quarter of 2024.

On May 20, 2015, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned entity in the State of Delaware called GAHI Acquisition Corp. This entity was incorporated at the time to be the merger subsidiary for the acquisition of Blockchain Technologies Corp. (BTC) and other software system development.

On May 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with BTC. Under this agreement, BTC would have merged with GAHI Acquisition, and GAHI Acquisition, would have been the surviving corporation.

As an equity shareholder in BTC only, GAHC and GES have not used the BTC US Patent. Any use of the patent would require a new negotiation, and new contract with BTC.

The Company has determined that the initial investment of Blockchain Technologies Corp. will be written off. The Company s Board of Directors cancelled all transactions previously proposed but never acted on concerning GAHI Acquisition. GAHI Acquisition will remain a subsidiary for the exclusive use of any future transactions involving Blockchain Technologies Corporation.

The Company, GAHI, and GES do not trade crypto currency, nor participate in Initial Coin Offerings.

On June 15, 2019, GES entered into a Term Sheet to create a joint venture with TrueVote, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement GES was to invest 50,000 into True Vote thru a 24 Month Debenture and issue a three year warrant exercisable at 0.01 for 4,500,000 common shares of the Company.

Matthews and Jason Old as Board members. The Company was formed to explore opportunities in the oil, gas, mineral and energy business. Tidewater Energy Group Inc. has 40,000,000 common shares authorized, par value 0.001. There are currently 10,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding of which the Company holds 5,100,000 common shares (51 ). The Company invested 50,000 into Tidewater Energy Group Inc. for general capital and administrative expenses in January 2020.

On January 23, 2023, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned entity in the State of Nevada called Fortis Industria LLC, to explore acquisition opportunities.

On March 28, 2023, GES entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Enfield Exploration Corp., a corporation existing under the laws of the Provinces of British Columbia, Albert and Ontario, whereby Enfield will acquire the business of GES. The purchase price shall be the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of Enfield at a deemed price of USD 0.50 per share in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of GES. This transaction was terminiated on Sptember 1, 2023.

Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated recurring losses from operations and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to continually borrow to continue operating. In addition, certain of the Company s debt is in default as of September 30, 2023. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or acquire or develop a business that generates sufficient positive cash flows from operations. The Company continues to raise funds from the issuance of additional convertible promissory note. Management is hopeful that with their ability to raise additional funds that the Company should be able to continue as a going concern.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and include the accounts of GAHI and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries, GES, GAHI Acquisition Corp and Tidewater Energy Group, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the Company s annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted.

The December 31, 2022 condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023 or for any future period.

Noncontrolling Interest

The Company follows ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which governs the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests NCIs in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parent s ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance.

The net income (loss) attributed to the NCI is separately designated in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Earnings per share is calculated in accordance with the ASC 260-10, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings-per-share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings-per-share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible notes, stock options and warrants were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The following potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in th e United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates 
 reflected in the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, share-based compensation, and assumptions used in valuing derivative liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

11

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all demand and time deposits and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Convertible Debt

Convertible debt is accounted for under FASB ASC 470, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options. The Company records a beneficial conversion feature BCF related to the issuance of convertible debt that has conversion features at fixed or adjustable rates that are in-the-money when issued and records the relative fair value of any warrants issued with those instruments. The BCF for the convertible instruments is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion features, both of which are credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company calculates the fair value of warrants issued with the convertible instruments using the Black-Scholes valuation method, using the same assumptions used for valuing stock options, except that the contractual life of the warrant is used. 

Under these guidelines, the Company allocates the value of the proceeds received from a convertible debt transaction between the conversion feature and any other detachable instruments (such as warrants) on a relative fair value basis. The allocated fair value of the BCF and warrants are recorded as a debt discount and is accreted over the expected term of the convertible debt as interest expense. 

The Company accounts for modifications of its embedded conversion features in accordance with the ASC which requires the modification of a convertible debt instrument that changes the fair value of an embedded conversion feature and the subsequent recognition of interest expense or the associated debt instrument when the modification does not result in a debt extinguishment.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton model to value the derivative instruments. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers. The Company earns revenues through various services it provides to its clients. GES s income is recognized at the presentation date of the certification of the election results. The payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Should an election not proceed, all non-refundable deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statements of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees.

12

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820-10 defines fair value and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

Cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue
 The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these items are a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their short term nature.

Promissory notes payable and convertible promissory notes payable
 Promissory notes payable and convertible promissory notes payable are recorded at amortized cost. The carrying amount approximates their fair value.

The Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for the beneficial conversion feature and warrant derivative liabilities as their fair values were determined by using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company s derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments to fair value of derivatives.

The following table presents the Company s assets and liabilities required to be reflected within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

Income Taxes 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 , Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity , and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract in entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Board specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluation the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards could have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements. As new accounting pronouncements are issued, we will adopt those that are applicable under the circumstances.

Current GES Corporate Operations

GES has developed and deployed proprietary Registration software, which was designed specifically to authenticate and register voters. This proprietary software functions as a data storage and retrieval registration system by cross-referencing eligibility status within a control voter database. In a mail ballot election, the voter s ID barcode, QR code, or signature on the Business Reply Envelope, can be scanned and the status of that voter is identified. If the voter is not eligible to vote or another ballot for that individual has already been registered in the system, that ballot is marked VOID and removed from the count. In an in-person election, the voter provides their name for look-up in the system. If they have not voted, a signature box pops up on the screen, the voter signs an electronic signature pad and the digital signature is captured next to their name. If a voter tries to vote more than once, an alert will pop up indicating that the voter has already registered, and the voter will not receive an additional ballot. Because we account for every single ballot, the system has multiple reporting options, which include the list of valid envelopes and list of voters whose ballot was void, detailing the reason. Once the voter is authenticated, the identifiers are removed to ensure a secret vote and the ballot is scanned for tabulation.

GES developed proprietary Scanning and Tabulation election software. This software features advanced OMR/OCR/Barcode scanning and tabulation system featuring de-skewing, de-speckling and image correction. The computer hardware was designed to run without Internet or Wi-Fi access and is hard wired, ensuring complete security. The system allows for triple-auditing capabilities, which are; electronically generated tabulation results, .jpeg imaging and storage, and the original physical ballot. This advancement gives GES the ability to tabulate elections faster and more efficiently. As experts in paper/mail ballot elections, GES began deploying this system in our elections in the third quarter of 2017 and it has been operating flawlessly.

In 2020 GES developed, built and implemented a propriety online election voting solution that is compliant with Title IV of the United States Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards.

GES built the platform on one of the most secure global infrastructures Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is a comprehensive, evolving platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platform as a service and packaged software (PaaS), and software as a service offerings (SaaS).

The platform enables GES to protect individual client data, including the ability to encrypt it, move it, and manage retention (if required). All data flowing across the global network interconnects with the GES secured data center and is automatically encrypted at the physical layer before it leaves our secured facilities. Additional encryption layers exist as well.

28

GES controls where our client data is stored, who can access it, and what resources your organization is utilizing at any given moment. Fine-grain identity and access controls combined with continuous monitoring for near real-time security information ensures that the right resources have the right access at all times, wherever your information is stored.

GES encryption software uses AES 256 with a cryptographic key using a RSA elliptic curve of 4096, which is used to encrypt the communication of the client and the GES server, as well all client data hosted in the server. A six-digit security code, delivered to the voter s email address provided by the client, must be validated by the prospective voter in order to authenticate the identity of the voter before the voter may access the ballot. After validating the voter, the voter then votes anonymously, so that the identity of the voter and the ballot cast can never be matched.

The GES voting platform verifies that the users does not use the back and forward browser button, a safe mechanism against tampering. Distributed denial of service DDoS protection tools help secure websites and applications and prevent DDoS attacks, which bombard websites with traffic traditionally delivered via botnets" that are created by networked endpoints connected via malware. The DDoS software protection provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency.

Management believes there is an opportunity in conducting United States and Foreign Government Elections. GES senior Management teams primary business for 40 years has been mail/absentee ballot elections. The market for GES conducting paper/mail ballot elections grew exponentially in January of 2017, when first President Barack Obama, and then President Donald Trump designated U.S. Elections Critical Infrastructure . The effect of these Executive Orders was to refocus the Department of Homeland Security, and the Elections Assistance Commission to reenergize compliance on U.S. Government elections, and assist by making available resources such as intelligence, funding, training and best practices in election software and hardware, for all 50 States.

On March 23, 2018, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 into law, which included 380 million in Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grants for states to make election security improvements. Among the authorized uses of the grant funds is the replacement of voting equipment, specifically equipment that does not produce a paper record or that is determined to be at the end of its useful life. Recent published examples are:

On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 into law. The Act includes 425 million in new HAVA funds made available.

In 2019, Hawaii 
 SB 166 allocated 789,598 for the purpose of a vote counting system contract.

In 2019, Georgia issued a 150 million bond package for the replacement of voting equipment statewide. The state also appropriated 12,840,000 from the General Fund for the purpose of financing projects and facilities for the Office of Secretary of State. 

In 2019, Wyoming appropriated 7.5 million into an election readiness account 
 HB 21
). The state's 

 3 million HAVA allocation

 will also be placed in this account, the majority of which will go toward replacing outdated voting equipment statewide. 

In 2019, North Dakota enacted 

 SB 2002,

 which included a one-time appropriation for voting equipment and electronic poll books statewide. The total amount of 11.2 million included 8.2 million in state funds and 3 million in HAVA funds. 

The opportunity for mail/absentee ballots became a page one story in 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. Subsequent accusations of voter fraud, compounded by President Trump declaring the 2020 U.S. election voting as rigged and fraudulent, has led to almost 40 of the U.S. Electorate believing the 2020 election was fraudulent.

On 
 October 23, 2019, the Brennan Center has estimated that the national cost for some of the most critical election security measures to be approximately 2.2 Billion dollars over the next five years. 

Every state has a vote by mail process right now. Voters may request an Absentee Mail Ballot from their County Board of Elections or a Vote by Mail ballot is sent. In either case, our proprietary registration and tabulation software has an immediate need. In the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, approximately 33 Million ballots were cast by mail making up about 25 of the votes. Most individuals think only of the Presidential election every four years as the Election. In reality, municipal Board of Elections throughout the U.S. are conducting elections annually for such elected positions as; Governor, Mayor, City Council, State Assembly, State Senate, Members of U.S. Congress (House every 2 years, Senate every 6) Civil and Criminal Justices, Sheriffs, School Boards, Village Trustees, etc. In short, most State and local municipal Board of Elections are in the market purchasing software and hardware every year.

29
 
 In the U.S. there are 3,007 counties, 64 parishes, 19 organized boroughs, 11 census areas, 41 independent cities, and the District of Columbia, all of whom must buy updated Election Machines and Software. Each municipal county individually purchases election voting machines under the guidance of their own State s Secretary of State.

The United States Government, through the Elections Assistance Commission, certifies election software and hardware for use in U.S. Government Elections. On February 10, 2021 the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) announced the adoption of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) 2.0. These guidelines have been formulated to improve cyber security, accessibility and usability requirements in the U.S. voting process.

Election Software Developers and Manufactures may also qualify by meeting individual requirements for individual States in the United States.

GES has begun undertaking the following six step benchmarks to qualify for the updated U.S. certification and is also considering individual State certifications;

Step 1
 - Voting System Testing, Testing current developed systems to U.S. Federal 2.0 Standards 

Step 2
 - Technical Data Package Review; Reviews submitted documents against documentation requirements of outside agencies, published standards, or U.S. specifications

Step 3
 - Physical Configuration Audit; Examines the documentation of the system against the actual submitted system 

Step 4
 - System Integration Testing; Executes tests on all components of a system configured as if the system was deployed

Step 5
 - Functional Configuration Audit; Examines submitted test data and conducts additional testing to verify submitted system hardware and software described in the documents submitted to the Elections Assistance Commission and the Department of Homeland Security

Step 6
 - Security Testing; Performs vulnerability assessments and penetration analysis to assess system vulnerabilities

Trends and Uncertainties

The Company currently has minimal revenues and operations and is investigating potential businesses and companies for acquisition to create and/or acquire a sustainable business. Our ability to acquire or create a sustainable business may be adversely affected by our current financial conditions, availability of capital and/ or loans, general economic conditions which can be cyclical in nature along with prolonged recessionary periods, and other economic and political situations. 

The Company has generated recurring losses and cash flow deficits from its operations since inception and has had to continually borrow to continue operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The continued operations of the Company are dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital, obtain additional financing and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. As further described in Liquidity and Capital Resources , management believes that it will be successful in obtaining additional financing, from which the proceeds will be primarily used to execute its new operating plans. The Company plans to 

use its available cash and new financing to develop and execute its new business plan and hopefully create and maintain a self-sustaining business. However, the Company can give no assurances that it will be successful in achieving its plans or if financing will be available or, if available, on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, and ultimately achieve adequate profitability and cash flows from operations, the Company would need to curtail certain or all of its operating activities. 

There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from our continuing operations except for the fair value change on derivative financial instruments and settlement on arbitration. 

30
 
 The rapid advances in computing and telecommunications technology over the past several decades have brought with them increasingly sophisticated methods of delivering administrating elections. Along with these advances, though, have come risks regarding the integrity and privacy of data, and these risks apply to election companies, falling into the general classification of cybersecurity. While it is not possible for anyone to give an absolute guarantee that data will not be compromised, when applicable, the Company shall utilize third-party service providers to secure the Company s financial and personal data; the Company believes that third-party service providers provide reasonable assurance that the financial and personal data that they hold are secure.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Not Applicable

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2023. 

32
 
 We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be not effective as of September 30, 2023 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or those persons performing similar functions, did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Important Considerations

The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.

Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
