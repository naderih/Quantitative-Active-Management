No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any external derivative instruments to either payment on the pool assets owned by the Trust or payments on the Notes or the Certificate.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.

The following six paragraphs are disclosures received from U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association U.S. Bank Trust Co. ), which serves as the indenture trustee (the Indenture Trustee under the indenture for the Toyota Auto Receivables
 2021-D Owner Trust transaction.

U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank N.A. made a strategic decision to reposition its corporate trust business by transferring substantially all of its corporate trust business to
 its affiliate, U.S. Bank Trust Co., a non-depository trust company (U.S. Bank N.A. and U.S. Bank Trust Co. are collectively referred to herein as U.S. Bank ). Upon U.S. Bank Trust Co. s succession to the business of U.S. Bank N.A., it became a wholly
 owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank N.A. The Indenture Trustee will maintain the accounts of the issuing entity in the name of the Indenture Trustee at U.S. Bank N.A.

U.S. Bank N.A. and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 
 The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank N.A. and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to
 comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and
 warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.

U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it
 has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank N.A. cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on
 the trustee or the RMBS trusts.

On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in
 the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank N.A. in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This
 lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al ., C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the 

NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning
 administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank N.A. concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain
 allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action.

U.S. Bank N.A. has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative,
 a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January
 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending.

U.S. Bank N.A. denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material
 respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA RELATING TO TOYOTA MOTOR CREDIT CORPORATION

EXHIBIT 34.1

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and management of Toyota Motor Credit Corporation

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria for Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, that Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (the
 Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for all publicly issued asset-backed security transactions backed by consumer auto retail installment sale
 contracts for which the Company is the servicer and that were issued on or after January 1, 2006 (the Platform described in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Regulation AB Servicing Criteria for Toyota Motor
 Credit Corporation as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii-iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix-xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the
 servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i-ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(vi-viii), the Company has engaged various vendors to
 perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered "servicers" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
 compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the
 Securities Act and the Exchange Act ("Interpretation 200.06"). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities
 comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as
 described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. Toyota Motor Credit Corporation s management is responsible for its assertion and for the
 Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American
 Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated,
 in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
 examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions
 and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
 procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this
 report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance
 with the servicing criteria.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement.

In our opinion, management s assertion that Toyota Motor Credit Corporation complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the Platform is
 fairly stated, in all material respects.

EXHIBIT 34.2

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

 U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S.
 Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities
 Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides t rustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform
 covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on
 our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight
 Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our
 examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company
 processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during
 the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
 the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no
 servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for
 our opinion.

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination
 engagement.

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the U.S. Bank Corporate
 Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
