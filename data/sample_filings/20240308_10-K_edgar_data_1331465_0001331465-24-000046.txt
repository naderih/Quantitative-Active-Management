 PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 
 
 General. The Bank is a federally chartered corporation that was organized in 1932 and is one of 11 district FHLBanks. The FHLBanks, along with the Office of Finance, comprise the FHLBank System. The FHLBanks are U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) organized under the authority of the FHLBank Act. Each FHLBank operates as a separate entity within a defined geographic district and has its own management, employees, and board of directors. The Bank s defined geographic district includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The Bank is supervised and regulated by the Finance Agency, an independent federal agency in the executive branch of the U.S. government. 
 
 Cooperative. The Bank is a cooperative owned by member institutions that are required to meet certain eligibility criteria and purchase capital stock in the Bank in order to become members of the Bank. Federally insured depository institutions, insurance companies, privately insured state-chartered credit unions, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs) with principal place of business located in the Bank s defined geographic district and engaged in residential housing finance can be eligible to apply for membership. The Bank s capital stock is not publicly traded and is owned entirely by current or former members and certain non-members that own the Bank s capital stock as a result of a merger with or acquisition of a Bank member. The Bank s membership totaled 795 financial institutions, comprised of 426 commercial banks, 246 credit unions, 60 insurance companies, 50 savings institutions, and 13 CDFIs as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Business Model. As a cooperative, the Bank s customers are also its owners. The Bank strategically focuses on positioning itself with its membership in a number of ways to enhance their total value in the cooperative by providing readily available, competitively priced funding , a potential return on investments, support for community investment activities, and other credit and noncredit products and services, including education opportunities on a range of topics to its member institutions. The Bank serves the public by providing its member institutions with a source of liquidity, thereby enhancing the availability of credit for residential mortgages and targeted community developments. The Bank primarily supports this mission by offering collateralized loans, known as advances, to its members. 
 
 The Bank s primary source of funds is proceeds from the sale of FHLBank debt instruments to the public. These debt instruments, known as consolidated obligations, are the joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks. Because of the FHLBanks GSE status, the FHLBanks are generally able to raise funds at favorable rates. The Bank s cooperative ownership structure allows the Bank to pass along the benefit of these low funding rates to its members. The U.S. government does not guarantee the debt securities or other obligations of the Bank or the FHLBank System. 
 
 Business. The Bank manages its operations as one business segment. Management and the Bank s board of directors review enterprise-wide financial information in order to make operating decisions and assess performance. 
 
 Based on the applicable regulation, the mission of the Bank is to provide to their members and housing associates financial products and services, including but not limited to advances, that assist and enhance such members' and housing associates' financing of: (1) housing, including single-family and multi-family housing serving consumers at all income levels; and (2) community lending. As part of their mission, the FHLBanks serve as a reliable source of liquidity to their members throughout the economic cycle. The Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin providing further guidance on FHLBank core mission achievement. The Advisory Bulletin provides that when developing its strategic business plan with respect to core mission, FHLBanks should consider the guidelines established in the Advisory Bulletin. Pursuant to the Advisory Bulletin, the Finance Agency will assess each FHLBank s core mission achievement by evaluating its core mission asset ratio, calculated as the ratio of primary mission assets, which include advances and acquired member assets, to consolidated obligations. This ratio is calculated annually at year-end, using annual average par values. Based on this ratio, the Finance Agency has provided the following expectations and framework for each FHLBank s strategic plan: 
 
 when the ratio is at least 70 percent or higher, the strategic plan should include an assessment of the FHLBank s prospects for maintaining this level; 
 
 when the ratio is at least 55 percent but less than 70 percent, the strategic plan should explain the FHLBank s plan to bring the ratio closer to the preferred ratio; and 
 
 7 

Table of Contents 

 when the ratio is below 55 percent, the strategic plan should include an explanation of the circumstances that caused the ratio to be at that level and detailed plans to increase the ratio. If the FHLBank maintains a ratio below 55 percent over the course of several consecutive reviews, then the board of directors should consider possible strategic alternatives. 
 
 The Bank s core mission activities primarily include the issuance of advances. The Bank s core mission asset ratio was 75.8 percent and 72.2 percent as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 The Bank s mission activities also include the Bank s Affordable Housing Program (AHP) which provides low to no cost funding to finance rental and for-sale housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. Each FHLBank must set aside 10 percent of its income subject to assessment for AHP, or such additional prorated sums as may be required so that the aggregate annual contribution of the FHLBanks is not less than 100 million. In addition to the required AHP assessment, the Bank s board of directors may, from time to time, authorize additional voluntary housing contributions to further the Bank s affordable housing mission. These programs will be discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business Community Investment Services . 
 
 Under the FHLBank Act, the Bank is exempt from ordinary federal, state, and local taxation, except employment and real property taxes. It does not have any subsidiaries nor does it sponsor any off-balance sheet special purpose entities. 
 
 For additional information regarding the Bank s financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations, refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 

Products and Services 
 
 The Bank s products and services include the following: 
 
 Credit Products; 
 
 Community Investment Services; and 
 
 Cash Management and Other Services. 

Credit Products 
 
 The credit products that the Bank offers to its members include advances and standby letters of credit. 

Advances 
 
 Advances are the Bank s primary product. Advances are fully secured loans made to members and eligible housing finance agencies, authorities, and organizations called housing associates (non-members that are approved mortgagees under Title II of the National Housing Act). The carrying value of the Bank s outstanding advances was 96.6 billion and 109.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and advances represented 63.4 percent and 72.3 percent of total assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Advances generated 71.0 percent, 69.6 percent, and 68.3 percent of total interest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Advances serve as a funding source for the Bank s members for a variety of conforming and nonconforming mortgages. Thus, advances support housing markets, including those focused on low- and moderate-income households. For those members that choose to sell or securitize their mortgages, advances can supply interim funding. 
 
 Generally, member institutions use the Bank s advances for one or more of the following purposes: 
 
 providing funding for mortgages held in the member s portfolio, including both conforming and nonconforming mortgages; 
 
 providing temporary funding during the origination, packaging, and sale of mortgages into the secondary market; 
 
 providing funding for commercial real estate loans; 
 
 8 

Table of Contents 

 assisting with asset-liability management by matching the maturity and prepayment characteristics of mortgage loans or adjusting the sensitivity of the member s balance sheet to interest-rate changes; 
 
 providing a cost-effective alternative to meet contingent liquidity needs and adhere to liquidity management strategies; and 
 
 providing funding for community investment and economic development. 
 
 Pursuant to statutory and regulatory requirements, if a Bank makes a long-term advance (other than a Community Investment Cash Advance (CICA) advance), it must be for the purpose of enabling a member to purchase or fund new or existing residential housing finance assets. The Bank uses the proxy test authorized by Finance Agency regulations to make this determination, by confirming, in connection with each long-term advance, that the principal amount of all long-term advances currently held by the member does not exceed the total book value of residential housing finance assets held by such member. 
 
 Eligible collateral is defined by the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and the Bank s credit and collateral policy. The Bank requires its borrowers to execute an advances and security agreement that establishes the Bank s security interest in all collateral pledged by the borrower, thereby obtaining a security interest in eligible collateral to secure an advance prior to the time that the Bank originates or renews an advance. The Bank also perfects its security interest in collateral prior to making an advance to the borrower. As additional security for a member s indebtedness, the Bank has a statutory and contractual lien on the member s capital stock in the Bank. The Bank may also require additional or substitute collateral from a borrower, as provided in the FHLBank Act and the financing documents between the Bank and its borrowers. 
 
 The Bank s management assesses member creditworthiness and financial condition, typically on a quarterly basis, to determine the term and maximum dollar amount of advances that the Bank will lend to a particular member. In addition, the Bank discounts eligible collateral and periodically revalues the collateral pledged by each member to secure its outstanding advances. The Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. 
 
 The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law. Most members provide the Bank with a blanket lien covering substantially all of the member s real estate-related assets and their consent for the Bank to file a financing statement evidencing the blanket lien. The Bank requires delivery of cash and securities pledged to the Bank as collateral. Delivery of loan collateral is also required when pledged by insurance companies, CDFIs, and housing associates. For most commercial bank 
 and credit union members, delivery of loan collateral is not required. The Bank periodically works with commercial bank and credit union members to release collateral from the Bank s lien to permit such members to pledge those assets to support borrowings, or potential borrowings, from the Federal Reserve Banks discount window. 
 
 The Bank offers standard and customized advances to fit a variety of member needs. Generally, the Bank offers maturities as described below, but longer maturities are available, which are subject to a member s financial condition and available funding. The Bank s advances include, among other products, the following: 
 
 Adjustable- or variable-rate indexed advances. Adjustable- or variable-rate indexed advances include the following: 
 
 Daily Rate Credit Advance (DRC Advance). The DRC Advance provides overnight or short-term funding with rate resets on a daily basis, similar to federal funds lines. The DRC Advance is available generally from one day to 12 months. 
 
 Adjustable Rate Credit Advance (ARC Advance). The ARC Advance is an advance that floats to an index and provides intermediate and long-term funding with rate resets at specified intervals. The ARC Advance is available for a term generally of up to 10 years. 
 
 Floating-to-Fixed Advance. This is an advance that floats to an index and changes to a predetermined fixed rate on a 
 predetermined date prior to maturity. The Bank offers this product with a maturity generally of up to 15 years.

Table of Contents 

Callable SOFR Floater. This is an advance that provides intermediate funding at a variable rate, tied to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) with the option to repay the advance on specified dates with no prepayment fee. The call option may be Bermudan (quarterly) or European (one-time). The interest rate resets at periodic intervals, so pricing adjusts automatically to changing market conditions. Members can choose the advance term and rate reset period. 
 
 Fixed-rate advances. Fixed-rate advances include the following: 
 
 Fixed Rate Credit Advance (FRC Advance). The FRC Advance offers fixed-rate funds with principal due at maturity generally from one month to 20 years. The Bank allows for the inclusion of interest-rate caps and/or floors in certain FRC Advances with terms of 12 months or greater and a par value of 1 million or more. 
 
 Callable Advance. The callable advance is a fixed-rate advance with a fixed maturity and the option for the borrower to prepay the advance on an option exercise date(s) before maturity without a fee. The options can be Bermudan or European. The Bank offers this product with a maturity generally of up to 10 years with options generally from three months to 10 years. 
 
 Expander Advance. The expander advance is a fixed-rate advance with a fixed maturity and an option by the borrower to increase the amount of the advance on a predetermined future date at a predetermined interest rate. The option may only be European. The Bank has established internal limits on the amount of such options that may be sold based upon which quarter they will mature. The Bank offers this product with a maturity generally of two years to 20 years with an option exercise date that can be set generally from one month to 10 years. 
 
 Principal Reducing Credit Advance (PRC Advance). The PRC Advance is a fixed-rate advance with a final maturity generally of up to 20 years and predetermined principal reductions on specific dates. The reduction schedule is predetermined by the borrower and may be scheduled on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. Amortization options include equal payments or structures similar to a mortgage. 
 
 Convertible advances. In a convertible advance, the Bank purchases an option from the borrower that allows the Bank to modify the interest rate on the advance from fixed to variable on certain specified dates. The Bank s option can be Bermudan or European. The Bank offers this product with a maturity generally of up to 15 years with options generally from three months to 15 years. 
 
 Forward starting advances . With the forward starting advance, the borrower may enter into the terms of any structured advance, including the FRC Advance, ARC Advance, Expander Advance, or Floating-to-Fixed Advance, with a future settlement date. Interest begins to accrue on the settlement date. A termination fee applies if the borrower voluntarily terminates the advance prior to the settlement date. 
 
 The following table presents the par value of outstanding advances by product characteristics (dollars in millions). See Note 6 Advances to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements for further information on the distinction between par value and carrying value of outstanding advances.

 The Bank establishes interest rates on advances using the Bank s cost of funds on consolidated obligations and the interest-rate swap market. The Bank establishes an interest rate applicable to each type of advance each day and then adjusts those rates during the day to reflect changes in the cost of funds and interest rates.

 The Bank includes prepayment fee provisions in most advance transactions. With respect to callable advances, prepayment fees apply to prepayments on dates other than option exercise dates. The Bank also offers variable-rate prepayable advances, in which prepayment fees apply to prepayments made on dates other than certain specified dates. As required by Finance Agency regulations, the prepayment fee is intended to make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower s decision to prepay an advance before maturity or, with respect to a callable advance, on a date other than an option exercise date.

Standby Letters of Credit 
 
 The Bank issues irrevocable standby letters of credit on behalf of its members to support certain obligations of the members to third-party beneficiaries. Members may use standby letters of credit for residential housing financing and community lending or for liquidity and asset-liability management. In particular, members often use standby letters of credit as collateral for deposits from public sector entities. Standby letters of credit are generally available for nonrenewable terms of up to five years or for one-year terms that are renewable annually with a final expiration date of up to 10 years after issuance. The Bank requires members to fully collateralize the face amount of any standby letter of credit issued by the Bank during the term of the standby letter of credit. The Bank also charges members a fee based on the face amount of the standby letter of credit. If the Bank is required to make a payment for a beneficiary s draw, the amount must be reimbursed by the member or, subject to the Bank s discretion, may be converted into an advance to the member. The Bank s underwriting and collateral requirements for standby letters of credit are the same as they are for advances. 
 
 The Bank has never experienced a credit loss related to a standby letter of credit reimbursement obligation. Unlike advances, standby letters of credit are accounted for as financial guarantees because a standby letter of credit may expire in accordance with its terms without being drawn upon by the beneficiary. The Bank had 15.6 billion and 9.0 billion of outstanding standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Community Investment Services 
 
 The Bank s AHP provides no-cost or low-cost funds in the form of a direct subsidy or a subsidized advance to members to support the financing of rental and for-sale housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. The Bank offers the AHP General Fund and AHP Homeownership Set-aside programs. Additionally, the CICA program is offered to members in the form of a discounted advance program that supports projects that provide affordable housing and economic development benefiting those households. The Bank also funds voluntary housing programs such as the Multifamily Housing Bridge Fund (Bridge Fund). A description of each program is as follows: 
 
 the AHP General Fund is offered annually through a competitive application process and provides funds for either new construction or rehabilitation rental or ownership real estate projects submitted through member financial institutions; 
 
 the AHP Homeownership Set-aside program provides funds that can be used by homebuyers for down payment, closing costs, and other costs associated with the purchase, purchase/rehabilitation, or rehabilitation of homes for households at or below 80 percent of the area median income. The funds are available to eligible parties through member financial institutions and through the following distinct products: First-time Homebuyer, Community Partners, and Community Rebuild and Restore; 
 
 the CICA program consists of the Community Investment Program and the Economic Development Program, which both provide the Bank s members with access to low-cost funding to create affordable rental and homeownership opportunities and to engage in commercial and economic development activities that benefit low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods; and 
 
 the board approved the Bridge Fund which was first launched in November 2023 to help close funding gaps for affordable multifamily rental housing projects caused by the steep rise in interest rates and construction costs. The Bridge Fund offers up to 500,000 per project to the Bank s member financial institutions and their community housing partners in a competitive application process. Eligible projects for the Bridge Fund will include multifamily and mixed-use rental housing targeted to households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income. Projects must be at least fifty percent complete at the time of application and demonstrate a financing gap related to an increase in construction hard costs, such as construction materials and labor. Projects also must be located in the Bank s district, which includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

 Each FHLBank must set aside 10 percent of its income subject to assessment for AHP, or such additional prorated sums as may be required so that the aggregate annual contribution of the FHLBanks is not less than 100 million. The aggregate annual contribution of the FHLBanks exceeded 100 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. For purposes of the AHP calculation, each FHLBank s income subject to assessment is defined as the individual FHLBank s net income before assessments, plus interest expense related to mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The assessment for AHP is further discussed under the Taxation/Assessments heading below. The Bank s AHP assessments were 72 million, 21 million, and 15 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 In addition to the required AHP assessment, the Bank s board of directors may, from time to time, authorize additional voluntary housing contributions. In 2023, the Bank s board of directors authorized 19 million of additional voluntary housing contributions. This included 11 million in voluntary contributions to the Bank s AHP Homeownership Set-aside program and 8 million to its new Bridge Fund. In 2022, the Bank made a 5 million voluntary housing contribution to its AHP Homeownership Set-aside Program. 

Cash Management and Other Services 
 
 The Bank provides a variety of services to help members meet day-to-day cash management needs. These services include cash management services that support member advance activity, such as daily investment accounts, automated clearing house transactions, and custodial mortgage accounts. In addition to cash management services, the Bank provides other noncredit services, including wire transfer services and safekeeping services. These cash management, wire transfer, and safekeeping services do not generate material amounts of income and are performed primarily as ancillary services for the Bank s members. 
 
 The Bank also acts as an intermediary to meet certain derivatives needs of its smaller members that have limited or no access to the capital markets. This service assists members with asset-liability management by giving them indirect access to the capital markets. These intermediary transactions involve the Bank entering into a derivative with a member and then entering into a mirror-image derivative with one of the Bank s approved counterparties. The derivatives entered into by the Bank as a result of its intermediary activities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are separately marked to fair value through earnings. The Bank attempts to earn income from this service sufficient to cover its operating expenses through the minor difference in rates on these mirror-image derivatives. The net result of the accounting for these derivatives is not material to the operating results of the Bank. The Bank may require both the member and the counterparty to post collateral for any market value exposure that may exist during the life of the transaction. 

Mortgage Loan Purchase Programs 
 
 The Bank s mortgage loan purchase programs provided members an alternative to holding mortgage loans in a portfolio or selling them into the secondary market. Prior to 2008, the Bank purchased loans directly from member participating financial institutions (PFIs) through the Mortgage Partnership Finance Program (MPF Program), a program developed by FHLBank Chicago and the Mortgage Purchase Program (MPP), a program separately established by the Bank. The Bank ceased directly purchasing new mortgage assets under these mortgage programs in 2008. However, the Bank continues to support its existing MPP and MPF Program mortgage loan portfolios. The Bank may also acquire fixed-rate residential mortgage loans through participation in eligible mortgage loans purchased from other FHLBanks. 
 
 MPF Program 
 
 From time to time, the Bank had offered various products to members through the MPF Program. FHLBank Chicago, as the MPF provider, is responsible for providing transaction processing services, as well as developing and maintaining the underwriting criteria and program servicing guide. The Bank pays FHLBank Chicago a fee for providing these services. Conventional loans purchased from PFIs under the MPF Program are subject to varying levels of loss allocation and credit enhancement structures. Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed loans are not subject to the credit enhancement obligations applicable to conventional loans under the MPF Program. The PFI may retain the right and responsibility for servicing the loans or sell the servicing rights, and the PFI may be required to repurchase a loan in the event of a breach of eligibility requirement or other warranty. 
 
 One of the Bank s PFIs under the traditional MPF products, Truist Bank, was among the Bank s top 10 borrowers as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 MPP 
 
 The Bank s MPP is independent of other FHLBanks mortgage loan programs. Therefore, the Bank had greater control over pricing, quality of customer service, relationships with any third-party service providers, and program changes. Certain benefits of greater Bank control include the Bank s ability to control operating costs and to manage its regulatory relationship directly with the Finance Agency. There were no MPP PFIs that were among the Bank s top 10 borrowers as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The MPF Program and MPP are authorized under applicable regulations. Regulatory interpretive guidance provides that an FHLBank may sell loans acquired through its mortgage loan purchase programs so long as it also sells the related credit enhancement obligation. The Bank currently is not selling loans it has acquired through these mortgage loan purchase programs. The Bank maintains a portfolio of mortgage loans that were historically purchased directly from PFIs and are recorded on the balance sheet. The contractual maturity dates of some of the purchased loans extend out to 2047. 

Investments 
 
 The Bank maintains a portfolio of investment securities and other investments for liquidity purposes to provide for the availability of funds to meet member credit needs and to provide additional earnings for the Bank. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank s investment securities consist of MBS issued by GSEs or U.S. government agencies; securities issued by the U.S. government or U.S. government agencies; and state and local housing agency obligations. The investment securities portfolio generally provides the Bank with higher returns than those available in other permissible investments. The Bank s other investments may consist of interest-bearing deposits, overnight and term federal funds sold, and securities purchased under agreements to resell. U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency, and GSE securities were 57.5 percent and 61.9 percent of the Bank s total investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as discussed in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Investments . Investments generated 28.9 percent, 30.1 percent, and 29.5 percent of total interest income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The Bank s MBS investment practice is to purchase MBS from a group of Bank-approved dealers, which may include primary dealers. Primary dealers are banks and securities brokerages that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve System. The Bank does not purchase MBS from its members, except in the case in which a member or its affiliate is on the Bank s list of approved dealers. In all cases, the Bank bases its investment decisions on the relative rates of return of competing investments and does not consider whether an MBS is being purchased from or issued by a member or an affiliate of a member. The Bank s MBS balance did not include any investments that were issued by the Bank s members or an affiliate of a member as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Finance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in certain types of securities. These restrictions are discussed in more detail in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk Investments . 
 
 Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities exceeds 300 percent of the FHLBank s previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it purchases the securities. Regulatory capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital, the amount paid-in for Class A stock (if any), the amount of the Bank s general allowance for losses (if any), and the amount of any other instruments identified in the capital plan and approved by the Finance Agency. For discussion regarding the Bank s compliance with this regulatory requirement, refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Investments . 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit and market risk on its investments. For discussion as to how the Bank manages these risks, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Credit Risk Investments .

 Funding Sources 

Deposits 
 
 The FHLBank Act allows the Bank to accept deposits from its members, any institution for which it is providing correspondent services, other FHLBanks, or other governmental instrumentalities. Deposits provide some of the Bank s funding resources while also giving members a low-risk earning asset that satisfies their regulatory liquidity requirements. The Bank had demand and overnight deposits of 1.6 billion and 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 To support its member deposits, the FHLBank Act requires the Bank to have an amount equal to or greater than the current deposits received from its members as a reserve. These reserves are required to be invested in obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years. The Bank had excess deposit reserves of 104.0 billion and 115.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Consolidated Obligations 
 
 Consolidated obligations, consisting of bonds and discount notes, are the joint and several obligations of the FHLBanks, backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. Consolidated obligations are not obligations of the U.S. government, and the U.S. does not guarantee the consolidated obligations. The Office of Finance has responsibility for facilitating and executing the issuance of consolidated obligations for all the FHLBanks. It also services all outstanding debt. The Bank is primarily liable for its portion of consolidated obligations (i.e., those issued on its behalf); however, the Bank is also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on consolidated obligations of all the FHLBanks. Pursuant to other arrangements to which the Bank is bound by, an FHLBank may also be required to make payment of principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation of any other FHLBank upon failure of such FHLBank to meet an obligation. If the principal or interest on any consolidated obligation issued on behalf of the Bank is not paid in full when due, the Bank may not pay any extraordinary expenses or pay dividends to, or redeem or repurchase shares of capital stock from, any member of the Bank. At any time, the Finance Agency may require any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, whether or not the primary obligor FHLBank has defaulted on the payment of that obligation. 
 
 To the extent that an FHLBank makes any payment on a consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, the paying FHLBank is entitled to reimbursement from the noncomplying FHLBank. However, if the Finance Agency determines that the noncomplying FHLBank is unable to satisfy its obligations, the Finance Agency may allocate the outstanding liability among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding or on any other basis the Finance Agency may determine. 
 
 Finance Agency regulations also state that the Bank must maintain the following types of assets that are free from any lien or pledge in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount of the Bank s portion of the consolidated obligations outstanding, provided that any assets that are subject to a lien or pledge for the benefit of the holders of any issue of consolidated obligations shall be treated as if they were assets free from any lien or pledge for purposes of this negative pledge requirement: 
 
 cash; 
 
 obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, the United States; 
 
 secured advances; 
 
 mortgages that have any guaranty, insurance, or commitment from the U.S. or any agency of the U.S.; and 
 
 investments described in Section 16(a) of the FHLBank Act which, among other items, include securities that a fiduciary or trust fund may purchase under the laws of the state in which the FHLBank is located. 
 
 The Bank was in compliance with this Finance Agency regulation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Consolidated obligations are issued with either fixed- or variable-rate coupon payment terms that may use a variety of indices, such as SOFR and Overnight Index Swap (OIS). The Bank, working through the Office of Finance, is able to customize consolidated obligations to meet investor demands. Customized features can include different indices and embedded derivatives. The Bank offsets these customized features predominantly by derivatives to reduce the market risk associated with the consolidated obligations.

 Consolidated Obligation Bonds. Consolidated obligation bonds satisfy longer-term funding requirements. Typically, the maturity of these securities ranges from one year to 10 years, but the maturity is not subject to any statutory or regulatory limit. Consolidated obligation bonds can be issued and distributed through negotiated or competitively bid transactions with approved underwriters or selling group members. The FHLBanks also use the TAP Issue Program for fixed-rate, noncallable bonds. Under this program, the FHLBanks offer debt obligations at specific maturities that may be reopened daily, generally during a three-month period through competitive auctions. The goal of the TAP Issue Program is to aggregate frequent smaller issues into a larger bond issue that may have greater market liquidity. 
 
 Consolidated Obligation Discount Notes. Through the Office of Finance, the FHLBanks also issue consolidated obligation discount notes to provide short-term funds for advances to members, for the Bank s other investments, and for the Bank s variable-rate and convertible advance programs. These securities have maturities up to 366 days and are offered daily through a consolidated obligation discount note selling group. Discount notes are issued at a discount and mature at par. 
 
 Certification and Reporting Obligations . Under Finance Agency regulations, before the end of each calendar quarter and before paying any dividends for that quarter, the president of the Bank must certify to the Finance Agency that, based upon known current facts and financial information, the Bank will remain in compliance with applicable liquidity requirements and will remain capable of making full and timely payments of all current obligations (which includes the Bank s obligation to pay principal and interest on consolidated obligations issued on its behalf through the Office of Finance) coming due during the next quarter. The Bank is required to provide notice to the Finance Agency upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
 
 the Bank is unable to provide the required certification; 
 
 the Bank projects, at any time, that it will fail to comply with its liquidity requirements or will be unable to meet all of its current obligations due during the quarter; 
 
 the Bank actually fails to comply with its liquidity requirements or to meet all of its current obligations due during the quarter; or 
 
 the Bank negotiates to enter or enters into an agreement with one or more other FHLBanks to obtain financial assistance to meet its current obligations due during the quarter. 
 
 The Bank must file a consolidated obligation payment plan for Finance Agency approval upon the occurrence of any of the following: 
 
 the Bank becomes a noncomplying FHLBank as a result of failing to provide a required certification related to liquidity requirements and ability to meet all current obligations; 
 
 the Bank becomes a noncomplying FHLBank as a result of being required to provide notice to the Finance Agency of certain matters related to liquidity requirements or inability to meet current obligations; or 
 
 the Finance Agency determines that the Bank will cease to be in compliance with its liquidity requirements or will lack the capacity to meet all of its current obligations due during the quarter. 
 
 Regulations permit a noncompliant FHLBank to continue to incur and pay normal operating expenses in the regular course of business. However, a noncompliant FHLBank may not incur or pay any extraordinary expenses, declare or pay dividends, or redeem any capital stock until the Finance Agency has approved the FHLBank s consolidated obligation payment plan or inter-FHLBank assistance agreement or has ordered another remedy, and the noncompliant FHLBank has paid all its direct obligations. 

Capital and Capital Rules 
 
 The Bank must comply with regulatory requirements for total regulatory capital, leverage capital, and risk-based capital. To satisfy these capital requirements, the Bank maintains a capital plan. Each member s minimum stock requirement is an amount equal to the sum of a membership stock component and an activity-based stock component under the capital plan. The FHLBank Act and applicable regulations require that the minimum stock requirement for members must be sufficient to enable the Bank to meet its minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements. If necessary, the Bank may adjust the minimum stock requirement from time to time within the ranges established in the capital plan. Each member is required to comply promptly with any adjustment to the minimum stock requirement. 
 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 As of December 31, 2023, the membership stock requirement was 0.07 percent (seven basis points) of the member s total assets, subject to a cap of 18 million. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the activity-based stock requirement was the sum of the following: 
 
 4.75 percent of the member s outstanding par value of advances; 
 
 8.00 percent of any outstanding targeted debt or equity investment (such as multifamily residential mortgage loan assets) sold by the member to the Bank on or after December 17, 2004; and 
 
 0.10 percent (ten basis points) of members outstanding standby letters of credit. 
 
 In addition, the activity-based stock requirement may include a percentage of any outstanding balance of acquired member assets (such as residential mortgage loan assets), which was set at zero as of December 31, 2023. Since the Bank did not have any multifamily residential mortgage loan assets purchased from members or other targeted debt or equity investments outstanding, the targeted debt or equity investment stock requirement was inapplicable as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Although applicable regulations allow the Bank to issue Class A stock, Class B stock, or both in any combination, to its members, the Bank s capital plan allows it to issue only Class B stock. 
 
 The Bank s financial management policy contains provisions to help preserve the value of the members investment in the Bank and reasonably mitigate the effect on capital of unanticipated operating and accounting events. For additional information regarding the Bank s capital and capital requirements, as well as information regarding the Bank s retained earnings and dividends, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ; Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition Capital ; and Note 10 Capital to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements. 

Derivatives 
 
 Finance Agency regulations and the Bank s Risk Management Policy establish guidelines for derivatives. These policies and regulations prohibit the trading or speculative use of these instruments and limit permissible credit risk arising from these instruments. The Bank enters into derivatives to manage the exposure to interest-rate risk inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions, to achieve the Bank s risk management objectives, and to act as an intermediary between its members and counterparties. These derivatives consist of interest-rate swaps (including callable and putable swaps), swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. Generally, the Bank uses derivatives in its overall interest-rate risk management to accomplish one or more of the following objectives: 
 
 preserve a favorable interest-rate spread between the yield of an asset (e.g., an advance) and the cost of the related liability (e.g., the consolidated obligation bond used to fund the advance) by converting both fixed-rate instruments to a variable rate using interest-rate swaps; 
 
 reduce funding costs by combining a derivative with a consolidated obligation because the cost of a combined funding structure can be lower than the cost of a comparable consolidated obligation bond; 
 
 reduce the interest-rate sensitivity and repricing gaps of assets and liabilities; 
 
 mitigate the adverse earnings effects of the shortening or lengthening of certain assets (e.g., mortgage assets) and liabilities; 
 
 protect the value of existing asset or liability positions; 
 
 manage embedded options in assets and liabilities; and 
 
 achieve overall asset/liability management objectives. 
 
 The total notional amount of the Bank s outstanding derivatives was 111.6 billion and 81.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The contractual or notional amount of a derivative is not a measure of the amount of credit risk from that transaction; rather, the notional amount serves as a basis for calculating periodic interest payments or cash flows. 
 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 The Bank may enter into derivatives concurrently with the issuance of consolidated obligations with embedded options. When issuing bonds, the Bank generally simultaneously enters into derivatives to, in effect, convert fixed-rate liabilities into variable-rate liabilities. The continued attractiveness of such debt depends on price relationships in both the bond and derivatives markets. If conditions in these markets change, the Bank may alter the types or terms of the bonds issued. Similarly, the Bank may enter into derivatives in conjunction with the origination of advances with embedded options. Issuing fixed-rate advances while simultaneously entering into derivatives, in effect, converts fixed-rate advances into variable-rate earning assets. 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk in all derivatives due to potential nonperformance by the derivative counterparty. For further discussion as to how the Bank manages its credit risk and market risk on its derivatives, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Risk Management . 

Competition 
 
 Advances . A number of factors affect demand for the Bank s advances, including, but not limited to, the availability and cost of other sources of liquidity for the Bank s members, such as demand deposits, brokered deposits, and the repurchase market. The Bank individually competes with other suppliers of secured and unsecured wholesale funding. Such other suppliers may include the U.S. government, investment banks, commercial banks, and in certain circumstances, other FHLBanks. Smaller members may have access to alternative funding sources through sales of securities under agreements to repurchase, while larger members may have access to all the alternatives listed above. Larger members also may have independent access to the national and global credit markets. The availability of alternative funding sources to members can significantly influence the demand for the Bank s advances and can vary as a result of a number of factors, including market conditions, member liquidity levels, members creditworthiness, and availability of collateral. 
 
 Debt Issuance. The Bank competes with Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), other GSEs, and the U.S. Treasury, as well as corporate and supranational entities for funds raised through the issuance of unsecured debt in the national and global debt markets. Increases in the supply of competing debt products may, in the absence of increases in demand, result in higher debt costs or lesser amounts of debt issued at the same cost than otherwise would be the case. In addition, the availability and cost of funds raised through the issuance of certain types of unsecured debt may be affected adversely by regulatory initiatives that tend to reduce investments by certain depository institutions in unsecured debt with greater price volatility or interest-rate sensitivity than fixed-rate, fixed-maturity instruments of the same maturity. Further, a perceived or actual higher level of government support for other GSEs may increase demand for their debt securities relative to similar FHLBank securities. 
 
 Interest-rate Exchange Agreements . The sale of callable debt and the simultaneous execution of callable interest-rate swaps that mirror the debt have been important sources of competitive funding for the Bank. As such, the availability of markets for callable debt and interest-rate swaps may be an important determinant of the Bank s relative cost of funds. There is considerable competition among high credit quality issuers in the markets for these instruments. 

Regulatory Oversight, Audits, and Examinations 
 
 The Bank s business is subject to extensive regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations to which the Bank is subject cover all key aspects of its business, and directly and indirectly affect the Bank s product and service offerings, pricing, competitive position and strategic plan, relationship with members and third parties, capital structure, cash needs and uses, and information security. As discussed throughout this Report, such laws and regulations may have a significant effect on key drivers of the Bank s results of operations, including, for example, the Bank s capital and liquidity, product and service offerings, risk management, and costs of compliance. 
 
 The Finance Agency supervises and regulates the FHLBanks. The Finance Agency is responsible for ensuring that (1) the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner, including maintenance of adequate capital and internal controls; (2) the operations and activities of the FHLBanks foster liquid, efficient, competitive, and resilient national housing finance markets; (3) the FHLBanks comply with applicable laws and regulations; and (4) the FHLBanks carry out their housing finance mission through authorized activities that are consistent with the public interest. In this capacity, the Finance Agency issues regulations and policies that govern, among other things, the permissible activities, powers, investments, risk-management practices, and capital requirements of the FHLBanks, and the authority and duties of FHLBank directors. The Finance Agency conducts annual, on-site examinations of the Bank, as well as periodic off-site reviews. In addition, the Bank must submit monthly financial information on the condition and results of operations of the Bank to the Finance Agency. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the SEC, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 The Government Corporation Control Act provides that, before a government corporation (which includes each of the FHLBanks) issues and offers obligations to the public, the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe (1) the form, denomination, maturity, interest rate, and conditions of the obligations; (2) the time and manner in which issued; and (3) the selling price. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of the Treasury has the authority, at their discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate principal amount of 4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977. 
 
 The Comptroller General has authority under the FHLBank Act to audit or examine the Finance Agency and the Bank and to decide the extent to which they fairly and effectively fulfill the purposes of the FHLBank Act. Furthermore, the Government Corporation Control Act provides that the Comptroller General may review any audit of the financial statements conducted by an independent registered public accounting firm. If the Comptroller General conducts such a review, they must report the results and provide his or her recommendations to Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, and the FHLBank in question. The Comptroller General also may conduct their own audit of any financial statements of the Bank. The Bank was not reviewed or audited by the Comptroller General in 2023. 
 
 The Bank has an internal audit department; the Bank s board of directors has an audit committee; and an independent registered public accounting firm audits the annual financial statements of the Bank. The independent registered public accounting firm conducts these audits following the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General. The Finance Agency receives the Bank s Report and audited financial statements. The Bank must submit annual management reports to Congress, the President of the United States, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Comptroller General. These reports include audited financial statements, a statement of internal accounting and administrative control systems, and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm on the financial statements.

Human Capital Resources 
 
 The Bank s human capital is a significant contributor to the achievement of the Bank s strategic business objectives. In managing the Bank s human capital, the Bank focuses on its workforce profile and the various programs and philosophies described below. 
 
 Workforce Profile 
 
 The Bank s workforce is primarily comprised of corporate employees, with the Bank s principal operations in one location. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had 337 full-time and two part-time employees. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 45 percent of the Bank s workforce is female, 55 percent male, 48 percent non-minority and 52 percent minority. The Bank s workforce is sufficiently staffed, and historically has included a number of longer-tenured employees. As of December 31, 2023, the average tenure of the Bank s employees was 9.9 years. The Bank strives to both develop talent from within the organization and supplement with external hires. The Bank believes that developing talent internally results in institutional strength and continuity and promotes loyalty and commitment in the Bank s employee base, which furthers its success, while adding new employees contributes to new ideas, continuous improvement, and the Bank s goals of a diverse and inclusive workforce. There are no collective bargaining agreements with the Bank s employees. 
 
 Total Rewards 
 
 The Bank seeks to attract, develop, engage, and retain a diverse group of talented employees to achieve its strategic business initiatives, enhance business performance and increase shareholder value. The Bank s Employer of Choice strategy is supported by sponsoring a combination, of compensation of talent management, benefits and employee wellness programs. Specifically, the Bank s programs include: 
 
 Cash based compensation base salary, performance based incentives, service awards, and spot bonus program; 
 
 Benefits retirement plan benefits, health insurance coverage, flexible spending accounts, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, supplemental life insurance, and disability insurance;

 The Bank s Performance Management program provides a framework for managing and developing employee performance including accomplishment of individual and team objectives within the Bank s incentive compensation program. Annual ratings are based on established competencies and a consistent rating scale. The use of both a qualitative and quantitative rating scale allow managers to align pay and discuss performance and development. 
 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Program 
 
 Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE I) is a strategic priority for the Bank. The Bank recognizes that diversity of perspective increases capacity for innovation and creativity and that equity and inclusion allow the Bank to leverage the unique perspectives of all employees and strengthens the Bank s retention efforts. The Bank s DE I officer is a member of the senior management team reporting to the president and chief executive officer acting as a liaison to the board of directors. The Bank operationalizes its commitment to DE I through the development and execution of a three-year DE I strategic plan that includes quantifiable metrics to measure its success. The plan is annually reviewed and approved by the board and performance is monitored via regular reporting. DE I is also a key component of the Bank s incentive plan framework, which includes measures of success for each pillar of the Bank s DE I program. The Bank offers a range of educational opportunities and supports connection and belonging as well as personal and professional growth through the Bank s DE I initiatives such as employee resource groups and garners input into the program through the DE I council, employee resource groups and DE I ambassadors. 

Corporate Social Responsibility 
 
 The Bank is committed to implementing a governance and risk management framework related to its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program. The CSR program is overseen by the Bank s CSR committee, which is composed of representatives from various areas within the Bank. The CSR program is focused on the development of processes and reporting mechanisms to identify risks and opportunities, and measure the Bank s impact on social, governance, and environmental issues related to the Bank s mission, members, stakeholders, and communities. The Bank recognizes that identifying, assessing and measuring its impact on social concerns and the effectiveness of its governance structure, are conducive to the Bank s short- and long-term success. The Bank s CSR program continues to focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, affordable housing, community and economic development, climate risk in the Bank s region, and strong corporate governance.

Taxation/Assessments 
 
 The Bank is exempt from ordinary federal, state, and local taxation, except employment and real property taxes. However, each FHLBank must set aside 10 percent of their income subject to assessment for the AHP, or such additional prorated sums as may be required so that the aggregate annual contribution of the FHLBanks is not less than 100 million. The aggregate annual contribution of the FHLBanks exceeded 100 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. For purposes of the AHP calculation, each FHLBank s income subject to assessment is defined as the individual FHLBank s net income before assessments, plus interest expense related to mandatorily redeemable capital stock. If an FHLBank experiences a net loss for a full year, the FHLBank would have no obligation to the AHP for that year since each FHLBank s required annual AHP contribution is limited to its annual income subject to assessment. AHP assessments for the Bank were 72 million, 21 million, and 15 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 The following discussion summarizes some of the more important risks that the Bank faces. This discussion is not exhaustive, and there may be other risks that the Bank faces, which are not described below. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information included in this Report, including, without limitation, in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , the Financial Statements and Supplemental Data , and Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements. The risks described below, if realized, could negatively impact the Bank s business operations, financial condition, and future results of operations and, among other things, could result in the Bank s inability to pay dividends on, and/or repurchase or redeem, its capital stock. 
 
 Business and Regulatory Risk 
 
 High inflation, tightening monetary and fiscal policies, and broadening geopolitical conflicts could have a significant impact on the economy and to the Bank 
 
 In 2023, persistently high levels of inflation, tightening monetary and fiscal policies, and the ongoing geopolitical conflicts posed risks to the global economy and to the Bank, its members, and counterparties. In addition, in early 2023, a volatile and uncertain economic environment created stress in the banking industry and financial markets. Those factors, if continued, could increase certain risks faced by the Bank and adversely affect the Bank s results of operations and financial condition. The Bank continues to monitor the impact of these increased risks and take appropriate actions . 
 
 A prolonged downturn in the economy, including the U.S. housing market and related U.S. government monetary policies, could adversely affect the Bank s business activities and results of operations. 
 
 The Bank s business and results of operations are sensitive to the U.S. economy and the U.S. housing market. A prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy, deterioration in general economic conditions, or a downturn in the housing market could adversely affect the Bank s members, particularly those whose businesses are concentrated in the mortgage industry. Deterioration in the residential or commercial mortgage markets could also affect the value of collateral securing the Bank s assets. 
 
 Unfavorable economic and market conditions can be caused by many factors. Volatility and uncertainty in global economic and political climate can influence, among other business activities, member borrowing activity and the Bank s lending and investments patterns. Additionally, natural disasters, pandemics, and other widespread health emergencies, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks, civil unrest, geopolitical instability, or conflicts, or other unanticipated or catastrophic events could create economic and financial disruptions and uncertainties, which could adversely impact the Bank s business activities, ability to pay dividends, results of operations, as well as lead to operational difficulties. 
 
 The Bank s business and results of operations are significantly affected by the monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Board s policies directly and indirectly influence interest rates on the Bank s assets and liabilities and could adversely affect the demand for advances and consolidated obligations, as well as the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank s members. In addition, the FHLBanks currently play a predominant role as lenders in the federal funds market; therefore, and disruption in the federal funds market or any related regulatory or policy change may adversely affect the Bank s cash management activities, results of operations, and reputation.

Table of Contents 

 The Bank is subject to a complex body of laws and regulations, which could change or be applied in a manner detrimental to the Bank s operations. 
 
 The FHLBanks are GSEs, organized under the authority of the FHLBank Act, and governed by federal laws and regulations as adopted and applied by the Finance Agency. Congress may amend the FHLBank Act or amend or adopt other statutes in ways that significantly affect the rights and obligations of the FHLBanks and the manner in which the FHLBanks carry out their housing finance mission and business operations. Finance Agency, within its statutory authority, may issue regulations that impact FHLBanks securities, businesses and/or operations. New or modified legislation enacted by Congress or regulatory requirements applied or imposed by the Finance Agency or other financial services regulators could have a negative effect on the Bank s debt securities, ability to conduct business or on the cost of doing business. Reform of the federal support of U.S. housing finance, additional requirements for FHLBank membership, including capital requirements, asset composition tests and collateralization of advances, may, if implemented, directly and indirectly impact FHLBanks and other GSEs that support the U.S. housing market. Legislation and regulations affecting the Bank s members, including related to capital, liquidity and asset requirements may also impact the extent to which they engage in business with the Bank, potentially impacting the Bank s advances and earnings ability. Additional requirements for FHLBanks members, including capital requirements, measures that impact the valuation of the Bank issued debt securities and its collateralization, and other measures targeting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may, if implemented, directly and indirectly impact FHLBanks and other GSEs that support the U.S. 
 
 Changes or inconsistency in statutory or regulatory requirements, or their application, could result in, among other things, an increase in the FHLBanks cost of funding and regulatory compliance; a change in membership or permissible business activities; FHLBanks or member additional liquidity and capital requirements (including whether a member meets required tangible capital levels to access advances, or maintains certain asset levels in residential mortgage loans); a decrease in the size, scope, or nature of the FHLBanks lending or investment activities, any of which could negatively impact the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Following a comprehensive review that began in the fall of 2022, in late 2023, the Finance Agency issued the FHLBank System at a 100 Focusing on the Future report presenting its review and analysis of the FHLBank System and the actions and recommendations that it plans to pursue over a multi-year effort, in service of its vision for the FHLBank System. The report focused on four broad themes: (1) the mission of the FHLBank System; (2) the FHLBank System as a stable and reliable source of liquidity; (3) housing and community development; and (4) FHLBank System operational efficiency, structure, and governance. Many of the recommendations from the report may be implemented by the Finance Agency through ongoing supervision, guidance or rulemaking within its existing statutory authority, while other recommendations may require legislative action or further study. 
 
 The Bank cannot predict what actions will ultimately result from the Finance Agency s recommendations, the timing of any actions, the extent of any changes to the Bank or the FHLBank System, or the ultimate effect on the Bank or the FHLBank System in the future. Potential changes resulting from the Finance Agency s recommendations (including changes relating to the FHLBanks mission, liquidity role, membership and lending requirements, affordable housing contributions and support for community investment, or operations, structure, and governance) could increase Bank s operational costs and expenses, result in heightened scrutiny of the Bank and its mission and activities, and impact the Bank s business, which may affect the Bank s financial condition, or results of operations, or the value of membership in the Bank. The extent to which the report ultimately results in changes to regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations that impact or limit the use of Bank s advances by members or the Bank s ability to lend to members may have a significant negative impact on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Refer to Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legislative and Regulatory Developments for a discussion of recent legislative and regulatory activity that could affect the Bank. 
 
 Competition for advances and refinancing risk on short-term advances could have an adverse effect on earnings. 
 
 The Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. Advances are the Bank s primary product offering and represented 63.4 percent of the Bank s total assets for the year ended December 31, 2023. Demand for advances is affected by, among other factors, the cost and availability of other sources of liquidity for the Bank s members, including deposits. The Bank competes with other suppliers of wholesale funding, both secured and unsecured. Such other suppliers may include the U.S. government, investment banks, commercial banks and, in certain circumstances, other FHLBanks with which members have a relationship through affiliates. Large institutions may also have independent access to the national and global credit markets. From time to time, these alternative funding sources may offer more favorable terms on their loans than the Bank does on its advances. Changes made by the Bank to lower pricing of its advances to compete with these alternative funding sources may decrease the 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 Bank s profitability on advances, while pricing increases used to help sustain income may render the Bank less competitive. A failure by the Bank to adequately manage pricing could have a material adverse impact on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations, including dividend yields to members. 
 
 The Bank is exposed to risks because of member concentration. 
 
 The Bank is subject to member concentration risk as a result of the Bank s reliance on a relatively small number of member institutions for a large portion of the Bank s total advances and resulting interest income. The Bank may only accept members within the Bank s regulatory district that meet regulatory eligibility criteria, which restricts its ability to expand its membership. The Bank s largest borrower as of December 31, 2023, was Truist Bank, which accounted for 24.7 billion, or 25.5 percent of the Bank s total advances then outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, 10 of the Bank s member institutions (which includes Truist Bank) collectively accounted for 70.5 billion, or 72.7 percent, of the Bank s total advances then outstanding. The financial services industry continues to experience consolidation, which may impact Bank s members. If one or more of the Bank s largest borrowers ceased membership, or if the Bank were to experience a decrease in the amount of business with one or more of its largest borrowers, whether as the result of a merger or other transaction that displaces advance demand, or as a result of other market conditions, competition or otherwise, the Bank s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. 
 
 Liquidity Risk 
 
 The Bank s funding depends upon its ability to regularly access the capital markets. 
 
 The Bank s primary source of funds is from the sale of consolidated obligations in the capital markets, including the short-term discount note market. The Bank competes with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, other GSEs, and the U.S. Treasury, as well as corporate and supranational entities for funds raised through the issuance of consolidated obligations. The Bank s ability to obtain funds through the sale of consolidated obligations depends in part on prevailing conditions in the capital markets (including investor demand), such as the effects of any reduced liquidity in financial markets, which are beyond the Bank s control. The failure to obtain such funds on terms and conditions favorable to the Bank could adversely impact the Bank s ability to manage its liquidity. 
 
 Compliance with regulatory contingency liquidity guidance could restrict investment activities and adversely impact net interest income. 
 
 Liquidity is necessary to satisfy members borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank complies with regulatory liquidity requirements, which are designed to provide sufficient liquidity and to protect against temporary disruptions in the capital markets that affect the FHLB System's access to funding. Additionally, the Finance Agency increased liquidity requirements aimed at enabling the Bank to provide advances and letters of credit for members during a sustained capital markets disruption and which therefore may require the Bank to hold an increased amount of liquid assets, which could hinder the Bank s ability to meet its core mission asset ratio, and could reduce the Bank s ability to invest in higher-yielding assets and adversely impact net interest income. Refer to Item 1 . Business . Overview. for further discussion of the Bank s core mission asset ratio . 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Changes in interest rates could significantly affect the Bank s earnings. 
 
 Like many financial institutions, the Bank realizes income primarily from the spread between interest earned on the Bank s outstanding advances and investments and interest paid on the Bank s borrowings and other liabilities. Although the Bank uses a number of measures to monitor and manage changes in interest rates, the Bank may experience gaps in the interest-rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities resulting from duration mismatches. The existence of gaps in interest-rate sensitivities means that either the Bank s interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than its interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either case, if interest rates move contrary to the Bank s position, any such gap could adversely affect the net present value of the Bank s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, which could negatively affect the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Bank s businesses and results of operations are affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government, foreign governments and their agencies. The Federal Reserve Board s policies directly and indirectly influence the yield on interest- 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which could affect the success of the Bank s asset and liability management activities and negatively affect the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Net Interest Income for further discussion of the Bank s yield on assets and interest-rate spread. 
 
 The Bank relies upon derivative instruments to reduce its interest-rate risk associated with certain assets and liabilities on the Bank's balance sheet, including MBS and advances, and the Bank may be required to change its investment strategies and advance product offerings if it is not able to enter into effective derivative instruments on acceptable terms. 
 
 The Bank uses derivative instruments to attempt to reduce its interest-rate risk. The Bank determines the nature and quantity of hedging transactions based on various factors, including market conditions and the expected volume and terms of advances. As a result, the Bank's effective use of these instruments depends on the ability of the Bank to determine the appropriate hedging positions in light of the Bank's assets, liabilities, and prevailing and anticipated market conditions. In addition, the effectiveness of the Bank's hedging strategy depends upon the Bank's ability to enter into these instruments with acceptable parties, upon terms satisfactory to the Bank, and in the quantities necessary to hedge the Bank's corresponding financial instruments. 
 
 If the Bank is unable to manage its hedging positions properly or is unable to enter into hedging instruments upon acceptable terms, the Bank may be unable to manage its interest-rate and other risks or may be required to change its investment strategies and advance product offerings, which could affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Prepayment or refinancing of mortgage assets could affect earnings. 
 
 The Bank invests in MBS and has at times invested in whole mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can significantly affect the prepayment patterns of these assets, and such prepayment patterns could affect the Bank s earnings. In the Bank s experience, it is difficult to hedge prepayment risk in mortgage loans. Therefore, prepayments of mortgage assets could have an adverse effect on the income of the Bank. 
 
 The Bank may not be able to pay dividends or to repurchase or redeem members capital stock consistent with past practice. 
 
 The Bank s board of directors may declare dividends on the Bank s capital stock, payable to members, from the Bank s unrestricted retained earnings and current net earnings. The Bank s ability to pay dividends and to repurchase or redeem capital stock is subject to compliance with statutory and regulatory liquidity and capital requirements. The Bank s financial management policy addresses regulatory guidance issued to all FHLBanks regarding retained earnings. It requires the Bank to establish a target amount of retained earnings by considering factors such as forecasted income, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives, market risk, operational risk, and credit risk, all of which may be influenced by events beyond the Bank s control. The Bank s capital plan addresses minimum regulatory capital requirements. Events such as changes in interest rates, collateral value, credit quality of members, changes to regulatory capital requirements, and any future credit losses, may affect the adequacy of the Bank s retained earnings and may require the Bank to reduce its dividends, suspend dividends altogether, or limit capital stock repurchases and redemptions to achieve and maintain the targeted amount of retained earnings or regulatory capital requirements. These actions could cause a reduction in members demand for advances, or make it difficult for the Bank to retain existing members or to attract new members. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 The Bank s exposure to credit risk could have an adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations . 
 
 The Bank faces credit risk on advances, standby letters of credit, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets. The Bank requires advances and standby letters of credit to be fully secured with collateral. The Bank evaluates the types of collateral pledged by the member and assigns a borrowing capacity to the collateral, based on the risk associated with that type of collateral. If the Bank has insufficient collateral or is unable to liquidate the collateral for the value assigned to it upon payment default or failure of a member, the Bank could experience a credit loss on advances or standby letters of credit, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

The Bank assumes secured and unsecured credit risk exposure associated with securities transactions, money market transactions, supplemental mortgage insurance agreements, and derivative contracts. The Bank routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. The insolvency or other inability of a significant counterparty to perform its obligations under a derivative contract or other agreement could have an adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. The Bank s credit risk may be exacerbated based on market movements that impact the value of the derivative or collateral positions, the failure of a counterparty to return collateral to the Bank, or when the collateral pledged to the Bank cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Bank. Any failure to properly perfect the Bank s security interest in collateral or any disruption in the servicing of collateral in the event of a default could create credit losses for the Bank. 
 
 The Bank uses master derivative contracts that contain provisions that require the Bank to net the exposure under all transactions with a counterparty to one amount in order to calculate collateral requirements. Although the Bank attempts to monitor the creditworthiness of all counterparties, it is possible that the Bank may not be able to terminate the agreement with a foreign commercial bank before the counterparty would become subject to an insolvency proceeding. 
 
 The Bank is jointly and severally liable for payment of principal and interest on the consolidated obligations issued by the other FHLBanks and for jointly maintaining a minimum aggregate amount of AHP contributions 
 
 Each of the FHLBanks relies upon the issuance of consolidated obligations as a primary source of funds. Consolidated obligations are the joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, backed only by the collective financial resources of the FHLBanks. Accordingly, the Bank is jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the consolidated obligations issued by the FHLBanks through the Office of Finance. 
 
 The Finance Agency may at any time, pursuant to regulation, order an FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, including of another FHLBank. Pursuant to other arrangements to which the Bank is bound by, an FHLBank may be required to make payment of principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation of any other FHLBank upon failure of such FHLBank to meet an obligation. Although the Bank would be entitled to reimbursement from a non-complying FHLBank, the Bank could incur significant liability beyond its primary obligation under consolidated obligations due to the failure of other FHLBanks to meet their obligations, which could negatively impact the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If the aggregate AHP contributions of all FHLBanks were to fall below 100 million, the Finance Agency would prorate the remaining sums among the FHLBanks, subject to certain conditions, as may be required to meet the minimum 100 million annual contribution. 
 
 Changes in the Bank s credit ratings may adversely affect the Bank s ability to issue consolidated obligations on acceptable terms, and such changes may be outside the Bank s control due to changes in the U.S. sovereign ratings. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Bank has an issuer credit rating of Aaa/P-1 by Moody's Investors Service (Moody s) and AA+/A-1+ by Standard and Poor's Ratings Services (S P). The consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks (consolidated bonds and consolidated discount notes) carry credit ratings of Aaa/P-1 by Moody s and AA+/A-1+ by S P. On November 14, 2023, Moody s affirmed the Aaa ratings of FHLBanks and changed the outlook on these ratings to negative from stable, reflecting the change in outlook of the sovereign credit of the U.S., the S P rating remains with a stable outlook. Because of the FHLBanks GSE status, the credit ratings of the FHLBank System and the FHLBanks are directly influenced by the sovereign credit of the U.S., which is beyond the Bank s control. Downgrades or changes in outlook to the U.S. sovereign credit rating would likely result in downgrades in the credit ratings and outlook on the Bank and the consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks even though the consolidated obligations are not obligations of the United States. A potential failure by the U.S. to address its statutory debt ceiling in a timely manner and continued uncertainty relating to the debt limit, increase the possibility of potential credit-rating downgrades to the U.S. sovereign credit. 
 
 These ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies; therefore, the Bank may not be able to maintain these credit ratings. Negative ratings actions or negative guidance for the Bank, including as a consequence of U.S. debt levels, the U.S. fiscal budget process, and other uncertainties may adversely affect the Bank s cost of funds and ability to issue consolidated obligations or other financial instruments on acceptable terms, trigger additional collateral requirements under the Bank s derivative contracts, and reduce the attractiveness of the Bank s standby letters of credit. This could have a negative impact on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations, including the Bank s ability to make advances on acceptable terms, pay dividends, or redeem or repurchase capital stock.

Operational Risk 
 
 The financial models and the underlying assumptions used to value financial instruments and manage risk may materially differ from actual results. 
 
 The Bank makes significant use of business and financial models for managing risk. For example, the Bank uses models to measure and monitor exposures to various risks, including interest rate, prepayment, and other market risks, as well as credit risk. The Bank also uses models in determining the fair value of certain financial instruments when independent price quotations are not available or reliable. The degree of judgment in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. If market quotes are not available, fair values are based on discounted cash flows using market estimates of interest rates and volatility, dealer prices or prices of similar instruments. Pricing models and their underlying assumptions are based on the Bank s best estimates for discount rates, prepayments, market volatility, and other factors. These assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, the related income and expense, and the expected future behavior of assets and liabilities. 
 
 While models used by the Bank to value instruments and measure risk exposures are subject to periodic validation by the Bank s staff and independent parties, rapid changes in market conditions could impact the value of the Bank s instruments, as well as the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. Models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions about future performance. Changes in any models or in any of the assumptions, judgments, or estimates used in the models may cause the results generated by the model to be materially different from actual results. 
 
 The Bank employs various strategies to attempt to manage the risks associated with the use of models. If the models are not reliable or the Bank does not use them appropriately, the Bank could make poor business decisions, including asset and liability management decisions, or other decisions which could result in a materially adverse financial impact for the Bank. 
 
 The Bank relies heavily upon information systems and other technology. Any disruption, failure, cybersecurity incident or threat of the Bank s information systems or other technology or those of critical vendors and third parties, such as the Federal Reserve Banks, could adversely impact the Bank s business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 
 The Bank relies heavily upon information systems and other technology to conduct and manage its business. The Bank owns some of these systems and technology, and third parties own and provide to the Bank some of those systems and technology. The Bank s information systems rely on certain critical vendors to provide technology solutions. Computer systems, software, and networks can be vulnerable to failures and interruptions, including as the result of any cybersecurity threats or incidents (e.g., breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events) or other breaches of technology security, that may derive from human error or malfeasance on the part of employees or third parties, other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, failure to implement key information technology initiatives, or accidental technological failure. At times, there may be an increased risk of cyberattacks as a result of geopolitical conflicts. These failures, interruptions, or cyberattacks could jeopardize the confidentiality or integrity of information, including personally identifiable information, result in fraudulent wire transfers, or otherwise interrupt the Bank s ability to conduct and manage its business effectively, including, without limitation, its deposit account management, hedging activities, and advances activities. The Bank can make no assurance that it or its third-party vendors will be able to prevent, timely and adequately address, or mitigate the negative effects of any such failure, interruption, or cybersecurity threats or incidents.

Like many financial institutions, the Bank has seen an increase in cybersecurity risk. For the Bank, cybersecurity threats have predominantly occurred through phishing, social engineering scams, and ransomware. The Bank s operations rely on the availability and functioning of its main office and off-site backup facilities. The Bank devotes substantial resources and deploys preventive measures to secure the Bank s systems, including firewalls, email security, and anti-virus solutions. These measures, or the Bank s system redundancies and other business continuity measures, may be ineffective or insufficient, and the Bank s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. A failure or interruption in the Bank s business continuity, disaster recovery or certain information systems, or a cybersecurity event, could significantly harm the Bank s reputation, its customer relations, risk management, and profitability, and could result in financial losses, legal and regulatory sanctions, increased costs, or other harm. While the Bank maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance may be insufficient to cover all losses or types of claims that may arise. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Bank may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense, to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, or to comply with regulatory requirements. 
 
 Additionally, the Bank relies on the Office of Finance to facilitate the issuance and servicing of its consolidated obligations. A failure or interruption of the Office of Finance's operating systems as a result of cybersecurity incidents or threats could disrupt the Bank s access to funds, and could significantly harm the Bank s reputation, its customer relations, risk management, and profitability, and could result in financial losses, legal and regulatory sanctions, increased costs, or other harm. Refer to Item 1 C. Cybersecurity for further discussion of the Bank s cybersecurity risk management and strategy and governance. 
 
 The Bank s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate. 
 
 The Bank may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of its business, including operational risk, legal and compliance risk, interest-rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and credit risk. The Bank has adopted controls, procedures, policies, and systems to monitor and manage these risks. The Bank s management cannot provide complete assurance that those controls, procedures, policies, and systems are adequate to identify and manage the risks inherent in the Bank s business. In addition, because the Bank s business continues to evolve, the Bank may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in the business, and therefore, it may fail to enhance the Bank s risk governance framework to timely or adequately address those changes. Failed or inadequate controls and risk management practices could have an adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Natural disasters, including those resulting from climate change, in the Bank s region, could adversely affect the Bank s operations, profitability and financial condition. 
 
 Portions of the Bank s region or collateral locations also are subject to risks from hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other natural disasters. The Bank s region includes areas designated as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) which are deemed particularly vulnerable. Climate change contributes to the increasing unpredictability of major natural disasters, which could negatively affect the Bank s ability to predict losses from such events. 
 
 Natural disasters could damage or dislocate the facilities or the underlying business of the Bank s members, may damage or destroy collateral that members have pledged to secure advances or the mortgages the Bank holds for portfolio, create imbalances on insurance such as inadequate insurance, insurance shortfalls, premium increases, may impact to or the livelihood of borrowers of the Bank s members, or otherwise could cause significant economic dislocation in the affected areas of the Bank s region. Natural disasters could disrupt the Bank s operations or the operations of third parties on which the Bank relies. Steps to address the risk of more frequent or severe weather events resulting from climate change could result in a potentially disruptive transition away from carbon-intense industries and create additional transitional risks and costs that include those to adapt to new regulation to address climate change risks. Such a transition could negatively impact certain regions and regional economies, affecting the ability of borrowers in those industries or regions to pay their mortgage loans. Legal or regulatory responses to concerns about global climate change may lead to higher costs of compliance and increasing direct and indirect expenses and lending costs for the Bank s members. 
 
 The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, including as a result of executive compensation regulatory requirements, could adversely impact the Bank s business and financial results. 
 
 The Bank relies on key personnel for many of its functions and has a relatively small workforce, given the size and complexity of its business. The Bank s ability to attract and retain such personnel is important for it to conduct its operations and measure and maintain risk and financial controls. Additionally, the Bank must continue to recruit, retain and motivate a qualified and

Table of Contents 

 diverse pool of employees, both to maintain the Bank s current business, including succession planning, and to execute its strategic initiatives. Like many organizations, the Bank has experienced increased competition in its recruitment and retention of employees. If the Bank is unable to recruit, retain and motivate such employees, its business and financial performance may be adversely affected. 
 
 Each FHLBank s board of directors has the statutory authority and responsibility to select, employ and fix the compensation of its officers and employees in order to help ensure the hiring and retention of qualified staff. However, as the regulator of the FHLBanks, the Finance Agency has the authority to determine whether compensation paid to any executive officer is in its view not reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar businesses involving similar duties and responsibilities. Depending on how such authority is exercised, the Bank s ability to hire and retain qualified executive officers could be adversely affected.

 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 The Bank has implemented processes for assessing, identifying, and managing risks from cybersecurity threats or incidents that may directly or indirectly impact the Bank s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Please refer to Item 1 A . Risk Factors for a description of cybersecurity incident and threat risk. 
 
 The Bank s cybersecurity risk management framework for assessing, identifying, and managing risks from cybersecurity threats is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Bank s information technology assets and data and include specific controls for the monitoring, mitigation, and reporting on cybersecurity risk management. Those processes include information security policies, incident response and business continuity plans focusing on the Bank s appropriate response to threats and incidents and operations and business continuance. 
 
 The Bank s board annually reviews and approves the Bank s risk management policies. The Bank develops mitigation plans, monitors tactical implementation, and engages in detailed gap analysis, risk assessments and monitors remediation plans to close any outstanding gaps, all of which are overseen by the Bank s Security Governance Committee, and reported to the board. Cybersecurity risk management is integrated with the Bank s overall risk management framework overseen by the Bank s board. Bank policies establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Bank information in accordance with Finance Agency regulations and applicable laws. The Bank s cyber incident response plan determines how cybersecurity threats and incidents are identified, classified, escalated, and reported to senior management and the board. The cyber incident response plan also stipulates management s materiality assessment of the threat or incident for the purposes of public disclosure. The Bank s cyber incident response plan includes third party cybersecurity incidents and threats. 
 
 The business continuity management program is designed to oversee and implement resilience, continuity, and response capabilities to safeguard employees, products and services, minimize financial losses, and minimize the impact to service to members during a disruption event, which includes the unavailability of information technology assets due to cybersecurity threats or incidents and other unintentional events like fire, power loss, and other technical incidents such as hardware failures. The business continuity management program provides planning for the restoration of facilities, communications, information technology systems, personnel, and other components necessary for the continuity of critical Bank processes. The business continuity management policy is overseen by the board. 
 
 The Bank retains external consultants to assist in the development and monitoring processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity incident and threat risk. The Bank engages third-party services to conduct evaluations of security controls, whether through penetration testing, independent audits or consulting on practices to address new challenges. These evaluations include testing both the design and operational effectiveness of security controls. The Bank also requires subcontractors to report on cybersecurity incidents so the Bank can assess their impact. As part of the Bank s vendor management process, the Bank undertakes due diligence of third-party systems with whom the Bank will interact with, including risk profiling and classification, in addition to requiring data protection covenants in its vendor agreements. The Bank s vendor risk management program includes regular reviews and oversight of all service providers in accordance with a risk profile classification. The Bank reviews vendor performance, relevant technologies utilized by vendors and promotes escalation of any unsatisfactory reviews, as part of Bank s continuous assessment of its vendors.

During the period covered by this report, risks from cybersecurity incidents or threats did not have a material impact on the Bank s strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. The Bank has experienced minor cybersecurity incidents and threats in the past, none of which have had a material effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents may occur in the future and any such cybersecurity incident could result in significant adverse impact to the Bank, the Bank s members, and their customers. The Bank is prepared to assess materiality of any such cybersecurity incident from several perspectives including, but not limited to, the Bank s ability to continue to service the Bank s members and protect the privacy of their data entrusted to us, lost revenue, disruption of business operations, increased operating costs, litigation, and reputational harm. 
 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 
 The Bank s board of directors devotes significant time and attention to data and systems protection, including cybersecurity and information security risk. The board s Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee oversees the Bank s information security program through setting of policies and the Bank s risk management framework and has oversight of the cybersecurity risk management efforts which include risks from cybersecurity threats and has assigned specific controls for the mitigation, monitoring and reporting associated with those risks. The board also oversees management s approach to staffing, and processes and practices to gauge and address cybersecurity and information security risk. The board receives reports on management of cybersecurity risk and implementation of cybersecurity risk management as well presentations and reports on cybersecurity effectiveness assessments and monitoring updates, along with management s recommendations regarding Bank s information security policies. 
 
 The Bank s Security Governance Committee is led by the chief information security officer and has a cross-functional membership comprised of representatives from the Bank s operational risk, information security, information technology, legal, operations, and other departments that provide both specific, technical and multidisciplinary expertise to the committee. The committee has integrated oversight of the information security program, the physical security program, and is responsible for reviewing security policies and procedures, security exceptions and violations, the processes and standards to implement the policies and procedures defined in the cybersecurity risk management program, the Bank s cyber incident response plan, the security awareness program and implementation reports, and for providing guidance and monitor progress on major information security projects, and regulatory changes and requirements. 
 
 The Bank has a dedicated Information Security Department comprised of specialized professionals responsible for the day-to-day, hands-on management of cybersecurity risk and that handle the processes and procedures to mitigate and implement protective, proactive and reactive measures to protect the Bank against those risks, responsible for developing, documenting, and approving the Bank s technical information security control standards, guidelines, and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Bank s information technology assets and data under the Bank s control. 
 
 The combined expertise of the Bank s chief information officer and the chief information security officer in cybersecurity include graduation in Computer Science, Certification in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC), Certification in Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), and Certification in Information Systems Auditor (CISA), along with decades of experience in computer science, information and records security, business continuity, technology governance and compliance, technology risk services, cyber risk assessments, security operations monitoring and response, incident response, security strategy and architecture, awareness training, threat intelligence, identity and access management, vulnerability and penetration testing, maturity assessment, impact analysis, disaster events, recovery response, business resiliency, third party systems due diligence, deep knowledge of software systems and platforms, implementation methodologies, and various technology systems servicing internal and external customers. 
 
 The Security Governance Committee meets regularly and receives prompt and periodic information, as needed or applicable pursuant to Bank policies and plans, from the Information Security Department which in turn provides periodic, regular and prompt reporting to senior management. Reports include topics such as threat intelligence, major cybersecurity risk areas, technologies and best practices, project development and implementation, any cybersecurity incidents or threats occurred, as well risk assessment, management and monitoring updates, as applicable and as needed. 
 
 Bank policies and processes are designed such that the board would receive prompt and periodic information from management or the Security Governance Committee on any cybersecurity or information security incident or threat that may pose significant risk to the Bank and would continue to receive regular reports on any incident or threat until its conclusion. The Bank s Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee also receives regular presentations and reports throughout the year on cybersecurity and information security addressing a broad range of topics, including updates on technology trends, regulatory developments, legal issues, policies and practices, information security resources and organization, the threat environment and vulnerability

 assessments, and specific and ongoing efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to potential gaps, internal and external incidents and critical threats. At least quarterly, or more often, as necessary, the Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee discusses cybersecurity and information security risks with the Bank s chief information officer and chief information security officer. 

Item 2. Properties. 
 
 The Bank owns approximately 235,514 square feet of office space at 1475 Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30309. The Bank occupies approximately 220,017 square feet of this space and leases the remaining space to tenants. The Bank leases 2,993 square feet of office space located in Washington, D.C., which is shared with two other FHLBanks. The Bank also leases off-site backup facilities for the Bank s disaster recovery office space. The Bank s management believes these facilities are well maintained and are adequate for the Bank s operations. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 The Bank may be subject to various legal proceedings and actions from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of those matters presently known to the Bank will have a material adverse impact on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure. 
 
 Not applicable. 

PART II 

Item 5. Market For Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 
 The Bank s members own substantially all of the capital stock of the Bank. Former members and certain non-members, which own the Bank s capital stock as a result of a merger or acquisition of the Bank s member, own the remaining capital stock to support business transactions still carried on the Bank s balance sheet. The Bank s capital stock is not publicly traded or quoted, and there is no established marketplace for it, nor does the Bank expect a market to develop. The FHLBank Act and the Bank s capital plan prohibit the trading of its capital stock, except in connection with merger or acquisition activity. 
 
 A member may request in writing that the Bank redeem its excess capital stock at par value. Excess capital stock is FHLBank capital stock not required to be held by the member to meet its minimum stock requirement under an FHLBank s capital plan. Any such redemption request is subject to a five-year redemption period after the Bank receives the request, subject to certain regulatory requirements and to the satisfaction of any ongoing stock investment requirements applicable to the member. In addition, any member may withdraw from membership upon five years written notice to the Bank. Subject to the member s satisfaction of any outstanding indebtedness and other statutory requirements, the Bank redeems the member s capital stock at par value upon withdrawal from membership. The Bank, in its discretion, may repurchase shares held by a member in excess of its required stock holdings, subject to certain limitations and thresholds in the Bank s capital plan. The par value of all capital stock is 100 per share, and the operating threshold for daily excess capital stock repurchases is 100 thousand. As of February 29, 2024, the Bank had 797 member and non-member shareholders and 59 million shares of its capital stock outstanding (including mandatorily redeemable shares). 
 
 Finance Agency regulations prohibit any FHLBank from issuing dividends in the form of capital stock or otherwise issuing new excess capital stock if that FHLBank has excess capital stock greater than one percent of that FHLBank s total assets or if issuing such dividends or new excess capital stock would cause that FHLBank to exceed the one percent excess capital stock limitation. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank s excess capital stock did not exceed one percent of its total assets. Historically, the Bank has not issued dividends in the form of capital stock or issued new excess capital stock, and a member s existing excess activity-based stock is applied to activity-based stock requirements related to new advances or standby letters of credit, as applicable. 
 
 The Bank s board of directors has adopted a financial management policy that includes a targeted amount of retained earnings separate and apart from the restricted retained earnings account. For further discussion of those provisions of the financial management policy, dividends, and the Amended Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement (Capital Agreement) pursuant to which the restricted retained earnings account was established, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Capital .

 Because only members, former members, and certain non-member institutions, not individuals, may own the Bank s capital stock, the Bank has no equity compensation plans. 
 
 The Bank also issues standby letters of credit in the ordinary course of its business. From time to time, the Bank provides standby letters of credit to support members obligations, members standby letters of credit, or obligations issued to support unaffiliated, third-party offerings of notes, bonds, or other securities. The Bank issued 11.6 billion, 11.4 billion, and 19.9 billion in standby letters of credit in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. To the extent that these standby letters of credit are securities for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, the issuance of the standby letter of credit by the Bank is exempt from registration pursuant to section 3(a)(2) thereof.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis relates to the Bank s financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. This section explains the changes in certain key items in the Bank s financial statements from year to year, the primary factors driving those changes, the Bank s risk management processes and results, known trends or uncertainties that the Bank believes may have a material effect on the Bank s future performance, as well as how certain accounting principles affect the Bank s financial statements. For a discussion on the comparison between the results of operations for the years ended 2022 and 2021, see the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are contained in the Bank s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023. 
 
 This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Bank s audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report. Readers also should carefully review Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors , for a description of the forward-looking statements in this Report and a discussion of the factors that might cause the Bank s actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from these forward-looking statements. 

Executive Summary 

Business Overview 
 
 The Bank s business model is focused on enhancing the total value of the cooperative for its members by serving as their trusted advisor. The Bank is focused on providing value to members by delivering solutions that meet their needs and the communities they serve and enhancing the availability of residential mortgage and community investment credit. The Bank focuses these efforts on offering readily available, competitively priced advances, a potential return on investment, support for community investment activities, and other credit and noncredit products and services. As part of the Bank s cooperative structure, the Bank has chosen to operate with narrow margins, passing on its low funding costs to members, which causes the Bank s profitability to be sensitive to changes in market conditions. 
 
 The state of the economy and the Bank s regulatory environment are significant components in determining the Bank s overall business outlook as it impacts advance demand, asset and collateral values, member financial stability, funding costs, and many other facets of the Bank s operations. External factors such as liquidity levels at member institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, performance of global economies, and regulatory changes could have a significant effect either positive or negative on the Bank s financial performance. 
 
 Interest rates are also a significant factor on the Bank s business outlook. Changes in interest rates can impact the Bank s interest rate risk management, profitability, and return on equity (ROE). It can also impact member advance demand, as rate uncertainty can impact deposit levels at the Bank s members. 
 
 Merger activity involving the Bank s members can impact the Bank s business outlook. As the financial industry continues to experience consolidation, the Bank s membership base may decrease, and the Bank s advance balance and other business could increase or decrease significantly depending upon the size of the financial institutions involved in the merger. While the Bank s balance sheet is designed to expand and contract based upon advance demand, the Bank s business could be affected by this merger activity, including as a result of a single event, such as the loss of a member s business due to acquisition by a non-member.

 Financial Condition 
 The following table presents the Bank s total assets, total liabilities, and total capital (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below. 
 As of December 31, Change 2023 2022 Amount Percent Total assets 152,370 151,622 748 0.49 Total liabilities 144,254 143,976 278 0.19 Total capital 8,116 7,646 470 6.14 
 Total assets increased primarily due to a 13.3 billion, or 32.5 percent, increase in total investments, partially offset by a 13.0 billion, or 11.9 percent, decrease in advances. The increase in total investments includes a 6.2 billion increase in held-to-maturity mortgage-backed securities and 7.5 billion in liquidity investments. The decrease in advances was primarily due to member demand moderating during the latter part of 2023. 
 Total liabilities increased primarily due to a 421 million, or 87.6 percent, increase in accrued interest payable, partially offset by a 253 million, or 13.9 percent, decrease in deposits. 
 The increase in capital was primarily due to the increase in capital stock and retained earnings. The increase in capital stock was primarily due to increases in the membership stock requirement and in the advances activity-based stock requirement which became effective August 25, 2023. Retained earnings increased to 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to 2.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 The following table presents the Bank s significant income items for the years presented and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below. Change For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021 2023 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent Net interest income 889 327 281 562 172.41 46 16.17 Reversal of provision for credit losses (1) 1 65.16 Noninterest income 5 16 15 (11) (68.84) 1 10.51 Noninterest expense 173 138 149 35 25.61 (11) (6.86) Affordable Housing Program assessment 72 21 15 51 251.68 6 38.55 Net income 649 184 133 465 251.80 51 38.54 
 
 Increases in net interest income and net income were primarily due to an increase in interest rates which impacted income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities, as well as an increase in average advance balances. The positive impact to net interest income and net income related to the higher average advance balances was offset by a corresponding increase in average consolidated obligation balances. 
 
 Average advance balances were 125.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 75.8 billion for 2022. 
 
 Average consolidated obligation balances were 166.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 106.5 billion for 2022.

 The ROE spread to average daily SOFR for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was impacted by the explanation provided above related to the change in ROE, offset by an increase in average daily SOFR. 
 
 The increase in the Bank s net yield on interest-earnings assets for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to increases in interest rates that impacted the income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities.

 Total advances decreased by 11.9 percent as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022 primarily due to lower member demand towards the end of 2023. A significant percentage of advances originated during 2023 and 2022 were short-term advances. 
 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 40.5 percent and 45.5 percent, respectively, of the Bank s advances were fixed rate. However, the Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of advances to convert the rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, primarily based on SOFR. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 64.9 percent and 34.5 percent, respectively, of the Bank s fixed-rate advances were swapped. SOFR-indexed and OIS-indexed advances comprised 91.3 percent and 6.24 percent, respectively of the Bank s variable-rate advances as of December 31, 2023. The Bank also offers variable-rate advances that may be tied to indices, such as the federal funds rate, prime rate, or constant maturity swap rates. 
 
 The Bank s 10 largest borrowing member institutions had 72.7 percent of the Bank s total advances outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Further information regarding the Bank s 10 largest borrowing member institutions and breakdown of their individual advance balances as of December 31, 2023 is contained in Item 1. Business Credit Products Advances . The Bank monitors concentration risk and believes it holds sufficient collateral, on a member-specific basis, to secure the advances to all borrowers, including these 10 institutions, and the Bank does not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.

 The Finance Agency regulations prohibit an FHLBank from purchasing MBS and asset-backed securities if its investment in such securities would exceed 300 percent of the FHLBank s previous month-end regulatory capital on the day it would purchase the securities. As of December 31, 2023, these investments were 338 percent of the Bank s regulatory capital. These investments exceeded the 300 percent level due to a decrease in the amount of regulatory capital that resulted from a decrease in advances as of December 31, 2023. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement at the time of its MBS purchases and is not required to sell any previously purchased MBS. However, the Bank will be precluded from purchasing additional MBS until its MBS to regulatory capital declines below 300 percent. The Bank was in compliance with this regulatory requirement as of December 31, 2022, as these investments amounted to 274 percent of the Bank s regulatory capital. The increase in MBS as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, was due to the purchase of MBS during 2023. 
 
 The amount held in other investments varies each day based on the Bank s liquidity needs as a result of advances demand, the earnings rates, and the availability of high-quality counterparties in the federal funds market. The increase in other investments

Table of Contents 

 as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, primarily relates to an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell as the Bank retained additional liquidity at year-end 2023. 

Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio 
 The Bank purchased fixed-rate residential mortgage loans directly from PFIs and through participation in eligible mortgage loans from other FHLBanks. The decrease in mortgage loans held for portfolio from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the maturity and prepayments of these assets during the year.

 Members that sold mortgage loans to the Bank were located primarily in the southeastern United States; therefore, the Bank s conventional mortgage loan portfolio was concentrated in that region as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The following table presents the percentage of unpaid principal balance of conventional residential mortgage loans held for portfolio for the five largest state concentrations.

Deposits 
 
 The Bank offers demand and overnight deposit programs to members and qualifying non-members primarily as a liquidity management service. In addition, a member that services mortgage loans may deposit funds in the Bank that are collected in connection with the mortgage loans, pending disbursement of those funds to the owners of the mortgage loans. All the Bank s deposits are uninsured. For demand deposits, the Bank pays interest at the overnight rate. Most of these deposits represent member liquidity investments, which members may withdraw on demand. Therefore, the total account balance of the Bank s deposits may fluctuate significantly. As a matter of prudence, the Bank typically invests deposit funds in liquid short-term assets. Member loan demand, deposit flows, and liquidity management strategies influence the amount and volatility of deposit balances carried with the Bank. 

Consolidated Obligations 
 The Bank funds its assets primarily through the issuance of consolidated obligation bonds and consolidated obligation discount notes. The increase in consolidated obligations from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily a result of increased liquidity needs during the year. Consolidated obligation issuances financed 92.9 percent of the 152.4 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2023, a slight decrease from the financing ratio of 93.3 percent as of December 31, 2022. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 The Bank often simultaneously entered into derivatives with the issuance of fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds to convert the interest rates, in effect, into short-term variable interest rates, primarily based on SOFR. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 92.4 percent and 91.9 percent, respectively, of the Bank s fixed-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped. None of the Bank s variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds were swapped as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 26.6 percent and 28.7 percent, respectively, of the Bank s fixed-rate consolidated obligation discount notes were swapped. 

Capital 
 The FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations specify that each FHLBank must meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards. The Bank must maintain (1) total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least four percent of its total assets; (2) leverage capital in an amount equal to at least five percent of its total assets; and (3) permanent capital in an amount equal to at least its regulatory risk-based capital requirement. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations as the sum of paid-in capital for Class B stock and retained earnings. Mandatorily redeemable capital stock is considered capital for regulatory purposes . These regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank s compliance with these requirements, are presented in detail in Note 10 Capital to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements. 
 Finance Agency regulations establish criteria for four capital classifications, based on the amount and type of capital held by an FHLBank, as follows: 
 Adequately Capitalized - FHLBank meets or exceeds both risk-based and minimum capital requirements; 
 Undercapitalized - FHLBank does not meet one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; 
 Significantly Undercapitalized - FHLBank has less than 75 percent of one or both of its risk-based or minimum capital requirements; and 
 Critically Undercapitalized - FHLBank total capital is two percent or less of total assets. 
 The Director of the Finance Agency (Director) will make a capital classification for each FHLBank at least quarterly and notify the FHLBank in writing of any proposed action and provide an opportunity for the FHLBank to submit information relevant to such action. The Director is permitted to make discretionary reclassifications. An FHLBank must provide written notice to the Finance Agency within 10 days of any event or development that has caused or is likely to cause its permanent or total capital to fall below the level required to maintain its most recent capital classification or reclassification. In the event that an FHLBank is not adequately capitalized, the regulations delineate the types of prompt corrective actions that the Director may order, including submission of a capital restoration plan by the FHLBank and restrictions on its dividends, stock redemptions, executive compensation, new business activities, or any other actions the Director determines will ensure safe and sound operations and capital compliance by the FHLBank. On December 13, 2023, the Bank received notification from the Finance Agency that, based on September 30, 2023 data, the Bank meets the definition of adequately capitalized. 
 Each FHLBank is required to maintain a ratio of at least two percent of capital stock to total assets, measured on a daily average basis at month end. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with this ratio. 
 
 On July 27, 2023, the Bank s board of directors approved an increase to the B1 membership stock requirement and dollar cap, and the B2 advances activity-based stock requirement. The B1 membership stock requirement was increased from 0.05 percent to 0.07 percent of a member s total assets and the dollar cap was increased from 15 million to 18 million. The B2 advances activity-based stock requirement was increased from 4.25 percent to 4.75 percent of the member s outstanding par value of advances. These capital stock requirement changes were effective August 25, 2023 and resulted in an increase of 805 million in total capital stock. There were no changes to the B3 standby letters of credit activity-based stock requirement. 
 
 The Capital Agreement provides that each FHLBank will, on a quarterly basis, contribute 20 percent of its net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account, calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter, equals at least one percent of that FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations (excluding fair-value adjustments) for the calendar quarter. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends and are presented separately on the Statements of Condition. 
 
 Under the Bank s financial management policy, the Bank s targets were to maintain (1) a capital-to-assets ratio of 4.50 percent to 6.00 percent; (2) a retained earnings account balance equal to the restricted retained earnings account balance, plus extremely stressed scenario losses; and (3) unrestricted retained earnings greater than the retained earnings target. The Bank believes that daily excess stock repurchases and reasonable quarterly dividends give members greater certainty of a return of their principal or the receipt of a dividend, which in turn may have a positive impact on members appetite for advances. The Bank seeks to 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 pay an amount of dividends each quarter that are consistent with an attractive rate of return on capital to its member shareholders relative to an established benchmark after providing for retained earnings as discussed above. Beginning in 2021, the Bank began using SOFR as the index for its dividend spreads. The Bank s ability to maintain dividends depends on the Bank s actual performance, its ability to maintain adequate retained earnings, other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors , and the discretion of the Bank s board of directors. Information about dividends paid by the Bank during 2023, 2022, and 2021, is contained in Note 10 Capital to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements. 

Results of Operations 
 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of the Bank s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Net Income 
 The following table presents the Bank s significant income items for the years presented and provides information regarding the changes during those years (dollars in millions). These items are discussed in more detail below. 
 Change For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021 2023 2022 2021 Amount Percent Amount Percent Net interest income 889 327 281 562 172.41 46 16.17 Reversal of provision for credit losses (1) 1 65.16 Noninterest income 5 16 15 (11) (68.84) 1 10.51 Noninterest expense 173 138 149 35 25.61 (11) (6.86) Affordable Housing Program assessment 72 21 15 51 251.68 6 38.55 Net income 649 184 133 465 251.80 51 38.54 

Net Interest Income 
 
 The primary source of the Bank s earnings is net interest income. Net interest income equals interest earned on assets (including member advances, mortgage loans, MBS held in portfolio, and other investments), less the interest expense incurred on liabilities (including consolidated obligations, deposits, and other borrowings). Also included in net interest income are miscellaneous related items such as prepayment fees, the amortization of debt issuance discounts, concession fees, and certain derivative instruments and hedging activities related adjustments. 
 
 The following table presents key components of net interest income for the years presented (dollars in millions): 
 For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Interest income: Advances 6,681 1,748 306 Investments 2,719 755 133 Mortgage loans 6 7 9 Loans to other FHLBanks 1 Total interest income 9,406 2,511 448 Interest expense: Consolidated obligations 8,415 2,150 167 Interest-bearing deposits 102 34 Total interest expense 8,517 2,184 167 Net interest income 889 327 281 
 
 As discussed above, net interest income includes components of hedging activity. When hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting, the interest components of the hedging derivatives will be reflected in interest income or expense. Fair value gains and losses of derivatives and hedged items designated in fair value hedging relationships are also recognized in interest income or interest expense. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the cumulative fair value adjustment on the hedged item will be amortized into interest income or expense over the remaining life of the asset or liability. The impact of hedging on net interest income were decreases of 852 million, 211 million, and 219 million during the years ended December 31, 2023, 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Below are the primary factors that impacted net interest income and net income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: 
 
 Increases in net interest income and net income were primarily due to an increase in interest rates which impacted income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities, as well as an increase in average advance balances. The positive impact to net interest income and net income related to the higher average advance balances was offset by a corresponding increase in average consolidated obligation balances. 
 
 Average advance balances were 125.4 billion for 2023, compared to 75.8 billion for 2022. 
 
 Average consolidated obligation balances were 166.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 106.5 billion for 2022. 

The following tables present the change in interest income and expense due to volume or rate variance for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (dollars in millions). The interest-rate spread is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of net interest income or expense associated with the Bank s derivatives. If the derivatives do not qualify for fair-value hedge accounting under GAAP, the interest income or expense associated with the derivatives is excluded from net interest income and from the calculation of interest-rate spread and is recorded in Noninterest income (loss) as Net (losses) gains on derivatives. Amortization associated with some hedging-related basis adjustments is also reflected in net interest income, which affects interest-rate spread. 
 
 The Bank s interest-rate spread was 20 basis points, 16 basis points, and 34 basis points for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in interest-rate spread for 2023, compared to 2022, was primarily due to increases in interest rates that impacted the income from interest-earning assets more than the expense from interest-bearing liabilities. The overall changes in net interest income during 2023, compared to 2022, was primarily rate related.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity is necessary to satisfy members borrowing needs on a timely basis, repay maturing and called consolidated obligations, and meet other obligations and operating requirements. Many members rely on the Bank as a source of standby liquidity, so the Bank attempts to be in a position to meet member funding needs on a timely basis. The Bank is required to maintain liquidity in accordance with the FHLBank Act, Finance Agency regulations, and policies established by the Bank s management and board of directors. In addition, the Finance Agency, at times, has issued guidance and expectations to the FHLBanks related to liquidity. 
 Sources of Liquidity. The Bank s principal source of liquidity is consolidated obligation debt instruments. To provide additional liquidity, the Bank also may use other short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and loans from other FHLBanks. The Bank s consolidated obligations are not obligations of the U.S. and are not guaranteed by either the U.S. or any government agency, but have historically received the same credit rating as the government bond credit rating of the United States. As a result, the Bank generally has comparatively stable access to funding through a diverse investor base at relatively favorable spreads to U.S. Treasury rates. The Bank s income and liquidity would be adversely affected if it were not able to access the capital markets at competitive rates for an extended period. 
 The Bank s short-term funding is generally driven by member advance demand and is achieved through the issuance of consolidated discount notes and short-term consolidated bonds. Access to short-term debt markets has been reliable because investors, driven by increased liquidity preferences and risk aversion, including the effects of recent SEC money market fund reform, have often sought the Bank s short-term debt as an asset of choice. 
 The Bank is focused on maintaining an adequate liquidity balance and a funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities. The Bank monitors the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities and is committed to prudent risk management practices. In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank considers contractual maturities of its financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e. estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). External factors including Bank member borrowing needs, supply and demand in the debt markets, and other factors may also affect the liquidity balances and the funding balance between financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 Contingency plans are in place that prioritize the allocation of liquidity resources in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank or the Office of Finance. Under the FHLBank Act, the Secretary of Treasury has the authority, at their discretion, to purchase consolidated obligations up to an aggregate amount of 4.0 billion. No borrowings under this authority have been outstanding since 1977. 
 Liquidity Reserves for Deposits. Finance Agency regulations require the Bank to hold a total amount of obligations of the United States, deposits in eligible banks or trust companies, or advances with maturities not exceeding five years, in an amount not less than the amount of total member deposits. The Bank has complied with this requirement throughout 2023.

 Operational Liquidity. In order to ensure adequate operational liquidity (generally, the ready cash and borrowing capacity available to meet the Bank s intraday needs) each day, Bank policy establishes a daily liquidity target based upon member deposit levels and current day liability maturities and asset settlements. The Bank has met this liquidity requirement throughout 2023. 
 Additional Liquidity Guidance. The Finance Agency issued an Advisory Bulletin on FHLBank liquidity (Liquidity Guidance AB) that communicates the Finance Agency s expectations with respect to the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the Bank to provide advances and standby letters of credit for members during a sustained capital market disruption, assuming no access to capital markets and assuming renewal of all maturing advances for a period of between ten to thirty calendar days. The Finance Agency periodically issues supervisory letters that identify thresholds for measures of liquidity within the established ranges set forth in the Liquidity Guidance AB. 
 The Liquidity Guidance AB s measurements of liquidity include a cash flow scenario, on a daily basis, that projects forward the number of days for which the Bank should maintain positive cash balances assuming the renewal of all maturing advances and the maintenance of a liquidity reserve for outstanding letters of credit. The measurements of liquidity also include a funding gap measurement of the difference between assets and liabilities that are scheduled to mature during a specified period, expressed as a percentage of the Bank s total assets to reduce the liquidity risks associated with a mismatch in asset and liability maturities, including an undue reliance on short-term debt funding, which may increase debt rollover risk. The Liquidity Guidance AB permits an FHLBank to temporarily decrease its liquidity position, in a safe and sound manner, below the stated regulatory levels, as necessary for providing unanticipated extensions of advances to members or draws on letters of credit to beneficiaries. The Bank has met this liquidity requirement as directed by the Finance Agency throughout 2023. 

Summary of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents a summary of net cash provided by (used in) the Bank s operating, investing, and financing activities (dollars in millions): 
 For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 455 1,487 845 Investing activities 950 (76,664) 10,634 Financing activities (1,404) 74,439 (13,505) Net increase (decrease) in cash and due from banks 1 (738) (2,026) 
 
 Two primary drivers that can impact net operating cash flows are fluctuations in net income and net change in derivatives and hedging activities. 
 
 The Bank recorded net income of 649 million and 184 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 The Bank recorded a net negative change of 470 million in derivative and hedging activities for 2023 compared to a net positive change of 1.1 billion in derivative and hedging activities in 2022. The change in derivative and hedging activities was primarily driven by the change in interest rates. 
 
 The Bank recorded a positive change of 421 million and 409 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to changes in accrued interest payable. The change in accrued interest payable is primarily driven by the change in interest rates. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities fluctuate primarily based on advances and investing activities. 
 
 The Bank originated a total of 470.0 billion of advances and collected 483.4 billion of advances principal for 2023 compared to 381.3 billion and 315.8 billion, respectively, for the same period in 2022. 
 
 The Bank purchased investment securities of 10.8 billion and received proceeds from principal collected of 5.1 billion for 2023 compared to 11.2 billion and 3.4 billion, respectively, for the same period in 2022. For 2023, the Bank recorded a net change of negative 6.7 billion related to liquidity investments compared to a net change of negative 3.4 billion for the same period in 2022. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Net cash used in financing activities fluctuate primarily based on the issuance and payments for maturing and retiring consolidated obligations. 
 The Bank issued 413.2 billion in consolidated obligations and paid 414.2 billion for maturing and retiring consolidated obligations for 2023, compared to 876.4 billion and 804.6 billion, respectively, for the same period in 2022. 

Anticipated Cash Expenditures 
 
 The following table presents the payment due date or expiration terms of the Bank s significant anticipated cash expenditures as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions).

 (2) Includes future funding contributions for the qualified pension plan and scheduled benefit payments for the nonqualified defined benefit plans and postretirement health benefit plan. 
 
 Refer to the respective footnote in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on each of the 
 contractual obligations listed in the above table. 

Off-balance Sheet Commitments 
 The Bank s primary off-balance sheet commitments are as follows: 
 the Bank s joint and several liability for all FHLBank consolidated obligations; and 
 the Bank s outstanding commitments arising from standby letters of credit. 
 Should an FHLBank be unable to satisfy its payment obligation under a consolidated obligation for which it is the primary obligor, any of the other FHLBanks, including the Bank, could be called upon to repay all or any part of such payment obligation, as determined or approved by the Finance Agency. As of December 31, 2023, none of the other FHLBanks defaulted on their consolidated obligations; the Finance Agency was not required to allocate any obligation among the FHLBanks; and no amount of the joint and several obligation was fixed. Accordingly, the Bank has not recognized a liability for its joint and several obligations related to other FHLBanks consolidated obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the FHLBanks had 1,204.3 billion in aggregate par value of consolidated obligations issued and outstanding, 143.3 billion of which was attributable to the Bank. No FHLBank has ever defaulted on its principal or interest payments under any consolidated obligation, and the Bank has never been required to make payments under any consolidated obligation as a result of the failure of another FHLBank to meet its obligations. 
 The Bank generally requires standby letters of credit to contain language permitting the Bank, upon annual renewal dates and prior notice to the beneficiary, to choose not to renew the standby letter of credit, which effectively terminates the standby letter of credit prior to its scheduled final expiration date. Based on the creditworthiness of the member applicant and appropriate additional fees, the Bank may issue standby letters of credit that have terms longer than one year without annual renewals or that have no stated maturity and are subject to renewal on an annual basis. 
 Commitments to extend credit, including standby letters of credit, are agreements to lend. The Bank issues a standby letter of credit on behalf of a member in exchange for a fee. A member may use these standby letters of credit to facilitate a financing arrangement. Management regularly reviews its standby letter of credit pricing in light of several factors, including the Bank s potential liquidity needs related to draws on its standby letters of credit. Based on management s credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank did not deem it necessary to have an allowance for credit losses for these unfunded standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2023. 
 Refer to Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements for more information about the Bank s outstanding standby letters of credit.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the Bank s financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments and assumptions that affect the Bank s reported results and disclosures. Several of the Bank s accounting policies are inherently subject to valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments and are more critical than others to the Bank s results. The Bank considers fair value measurements and derivatives and hedging activities to be critical accounting policies because they require management s subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its judgments and estimates on current market conditions and industry practices, historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 The Bank carries certain assets and liabilities, including investments classified as available-for-sale and all derivatives, on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, representing an exit price. 
 
 Fair values play an important role in the valuation of certain assets, liabilities, and hedging transactions of the Bank. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or market-based prices, if such prices are available, even in situations in which trading volume may be low when compared with prior periods. If quoted market prices or market-based prices are not available, the Bank determines fair values based on valuation models that use discounted cash flows, using market estimates of interest rates and volatility. 
 
 Valuation models and their underlying assumptions are based on the best estimates of the Bank s management with respect to: 
 
 market indices (primarily SOFR and the OIS curve); 
 
 discount rates; 
 
 prepayments; 
 
 market volatility; and 
 
 other factors, including default and loss rates. 
 
 These assumptions, particularly estimates of market indices and discount rates, may have a significant effect on the reported fair values of assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and the income and expense related thereto. The use of different assumptions, as well as changes in market conditions, could result in a materially different net income and retained earnings. The assumptions used in the models are corroborated by and independently verified against market observable data where possible. 
 
 The Bank categorizes its financial instruments carried at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with GAAP. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency (observable or unobservable) of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Bank s market assumptions. The Bank utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 
 
 Refer to Note 14 Estimated Fair Values to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements for further discussion regarding how the Bank measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. 
 
 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
 
 General 
 
 The Bank records all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in current-period earnings. The Bank designates derivatives as either fair-value hedging instruments or non-qualifying hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied. The Bank has not entered into any cash-flow hedges as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 The Bank uses derivatives in its risk management program for the following purposes: 
 
 conversion of a fixed rate to a variable rate; 
 
 conversion of a variable rate with a fixed component to another variable rate; and 
 
 macro hedging of balance sheet risks. 
 
 To qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank documents the following concurrently with the execution of each hedging relationship: 
 
 the hedging strategy; 
 
 identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item; 
 
 determination of the appropriate accounting designation; 
 
 the method used for the determination of effectiveness for transactions qualifying for hedge accounting; and 
 
 the method for recording ineffectiveness for hedging relationships. 
 
 The Bank also evaluates each debt issuance, advance made, and financial instrument purchased to determine whether the cash item contains embedded derivatives that meet the criteria for bifurcation. If, after evaluation, it is determined that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated, the Bank will measure the fair value of the embedded derivative. 
 
 Assessment of Hedge Effectiveness 
 
 An assessment must be made to determine the effectiveness of qualifying hedging relationships. To make such an assessment, the Bank may use either (1) the short-cut method; or (2) the long-haul method. 
 
 If the hedging instrument is a swap and meets specific criteria, the hedging relationship may qualify for the short-cut method of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in the fair value of the hedged item is assumed to be equal and offsetting to the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. The Bank does not apply the short-cut method to hedging relationships. 
 
 The long-haul method of effectiveness is used to assess effectiveness for hedging relationships that qualify for hedge accounting but do not meet the criteria for the use of the short-cut method. The long-haul method requires separate valuations of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined to be highly effective, the change in fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk is recognized in earnings together and in the same income statement line item with the change in fair value of the hedging instrument. If the hedging relationship is determined not to be highly effective, hedge accounting will either not be allowed or cease at that point. The Bank performs effectiveness testing on a monthly basis and uses statistical regression analysis techniques to determine whether a long-haul hedging relationship is highly effective. 
 
 Accounting for Ineffectiveness and Hedge De-designation 
 
 The Bank accounts for any ineffectiveness for all long-haul fair-value hedges using the dollar offset method. In the case of non-qualifying hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Bank reports only the change in the fair value of the derivative. Both the net interest on the derivative and the fair value adjustments of a non-qualifying hedge are recorded in noninterest income (loss) as Net gains (losses) on derivatives on the Statements of Income. 
 
 The Bank may discontinue hedge accounting for a hedging transaction (de-designation) if it fails effectiveness testing or for other asset-liability-management reasons. The Bank also treats modifications to hedged items as a discontinuance of a hedging relationship. When a hedging relationship is discontinued, the Bank will cease marking the hedged item to fair value and will amortize the cumulative basis adjustment resulting from hedge accounting. The Bank reports related amortization as interest income or expense over the remaining life of the associated hedged item. The associated derivative will continue to be marked to fair value through earnings until it matures or is terminated.

 Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards 
 See Note 3 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements for a discussion of recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards. 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 
 
 The legislative and regulatory environment in which the Bank and its members operate continues to evolve as a result of regulations enacted pursuant to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank s business operations, funding costs, rights, obligations, and/or the environment in which the Bank carries out its housing finance and community lending mission are likely to continue to be significantly impacted by these changes. Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below. 
 
 Finance Agency s Review and Analysis of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Commencing in the fall of 2022, and over a period of several months, the Finance Agency undertook a review and analysis of the FHLBank System, in part through a series of public listening sessions, regional roundtable discussions, and receipt of comments from stakeholders and the public. This review covered such areas as the FHLBanks mission and purpose in a changing marketplace; their organization, operational efficiency and effectiveness; their role in promoting affordable, sustainable, equitable, and resilient housing and community investment; their role in addressing the unique needs of rural and financially vulnerable communities; member products, services; collateral requirements; and membership eligibility and requirements. 
 
 On November 7, 2023, the Finance Agency issued a written report titled FHLBank System at a 100 Focusing on the Future , presenting its review and analysis of the FHLBank System and the actions and recommendations that it plans to pursue in service of its vision for the future of the FHLBank System. The report focused on four broad themes: (1) the mission of the FHLBank System; (2) the FHLBank System as a stable and reliable source of liquidity; (3) housing and community development; and (4) FHLBank System operational efficiency, structure, and governance. The Finance Agency expects its initiative to continue as a multi-year, collaborative effort with the FHLBanks, their member institutions, and other stakeholders to address the recommended actions in the report and has stated that it can implement some of the recommendations from the report through ongoing supervision, guidance, or rulemaking, as well as through statutory changes by proposing specific requests for Congressional action. 
 
 Among other things, the Finance Agency has indicated that it plans to: 
 
 Update and clarify its regulatory statement of the FHLBanks mission to explicitly incorporate its view of the core objectives of the FHLBanks mission, which are (1) providing stable and reliable liquidity to members, and (2) supporting housing and community development; 
 
 Clarify the FHLBanks liquidity role and take steps that the Finance Agency believes will better position the FHLBanks to perform their liquidity function, including enhancing Finance Agency oversight of FHLBank credit risk evaluation of their members and establishing protocols for large depository members to borrow from the Federal Reserve Banks discount window; 
 
 Expand the FHLBanks housing and community development focus by requiring the establishment of mission-oriented collateral programs, re-evaluating the definition of long-term advances, exploring revisions to the Community Support Requirements, and reviewing the Affordable Housing Programs (AHP), Community Investment Programs, and Community Investment Cash Advance Programs to encourage greater use in a safe and sound manner. The Finance Agency will also recommend that Congress consider amending the FHLBank Act to at least double the statutory minimum required annual AHP contributions by the FHLBanks; and 
 
 Review the FHLBanks operational efficiencies through encouraging collaboration among the FHLBanks, evaluating the size and structure of FHLBank boards, considering the structure of FHLBank districts and composition of their membership, and studying whether realignment or consolidation are necessary for the efficiency of the FHLBank System. 
 
 The Bank is continuing to evaluate the report and is not able to predict what actions will ultimately result from the Finance Agency s recommendations in the report, the timing of these actions, the extent of any changes to the Bank or the FHLBank System, or the ultimate effect on the Bank or the FHLBank System in the future. The Bank plans to continue to engage with the Finance Agency and other stakeholders to ensure that the FHLBank System remains well positioned to serve the Bank s members and their communities. For a further discussion of related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors .

 Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program. On March 12, 2023, in response to prevailing concerns on banks liquidity, the Federal Reserve announced the implementation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), as an additional source of liquidity. Eligible borrowers under the program include any U.S. federally insured depository institution or U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank that is eligible for primary credit with the Federal Reserve. The BTFP offers up to one-year term loans to be secured by eligible collateral owned by eligible borrowers as of March 12, 2023. Such loans can be requested until March 11, 2024. The BTFP is subject to 25 billion in credit protection by the U.S. Department of Treasury. On January 24, 2024,the Federal Reserve announced that the BTFP will cease making new loans as scheduled on March 11, 2024. 
 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Final Rule. On March 30, 2023, the CFPB issued a final rule requiring certain covered financial institutions to collect and report small business lending data. Small businesses are businesses with 5 million or less in gross annual revenue in the preceding fiscal year. An FHLBank will be subject to data collection and reporting obligations if the FHLBank has originated a minimum of 100 covered credit transactions to small businesses in each of the two preceding calendar years. The final rule implements phased-in compliance dates, beginning on October 1, 2024, based on the number of originations the covered financial institution makes to small businesses within a specified timeframe. The Bank is assessing to which extent the obligations will be triggered for the Bank and what operational changes will be necessary for compliance. While the Bank is still analyzing the impact of the final rule, it does not believe these changes will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Under a federal court order in a related litigation, the CFPB has been enjoined from implementing and enforcing the final rule against covered financial institutions nationwide and all deadlines for compliance with the final rule have been stayed. 
 
 Finance Agency Proposed Rule on Fair Lending, Fair Housing, and Equitable Housing Finance Plans. On April 26, 2023, the Finance Agency published a proposed rule that specifies requirements related to FHLBank compliance with fair housing and fair lending laws and prohibitions on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The fair housing and fair lending laws would be the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and those acts implementing regulations. Further, the proposed rule would outline the Finance Agency s enforcement authority. The Bank is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule on the Bank and its operations. 
 
 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Joint Proposed Rule to Revise Capital Requirements for Certain Large Banking Organizations. On September 18, 2023, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would substantially revise the regulatory capital requirements applicable to certain large banking organizations and banking organizations with significant trading activity, which are generally consistent with changes to international capital standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, known as Basel III. These proposed rules would amend the calculation of risk-based capital requirements in an attempt to better reflect the risks of these banking organizations exposures; reduce the complexity of the framework; enhance the consistency of requirements across these banking organizations; and facilitate more effective supervisory and market assessments of capital adequacy. For certain collateralized transactions, under existing capital requirements, debt securities issued by a GSE such as the FHLBanks are afforded a lower market price volatility haircut than higher risk non-GSE investment-grade securities. The proposed rules would increase the market price volatility haircuts applicable to debt securities of the GSEs (including the FHLBanks) by applying to these debt securities the same haircuts as non-GSE investment-grade securities. The Bank continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rulemaking on its financial condition and results of operation. The proposed change to market price volatility haircuts applicable to debt securities of the FHLBanks may harm liquidity for FHLBank debt securities in the market, impact general demand for FHLBank debt securities, and increase the FHLBanks cost of funding due to potential higher interest rates as a result of the foregoing. The proposal was open for public comment through January 16, 2024, and the FHLBank System submitted a comment letter. 
 
 The Bank continues to monitor these actions and guidance as they evolve and to evaluate their potential impact on the Bank. 

Risk Management 
 The Bank s lending, investment and funding activities, and use of derivative hedge instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks. The Bank s robust risk management framework is designed to align risk-taking activities with the Bank s strategies and risk appetite and to appropriately balance risks and rewards. The Bank s risk management framework consists of risk governance, risk appetite, and risk management policies. 
 
 The Bank s board of directors and management recognize that risks are inherent to the Bank s business model and that the process of establishing a risk appetite does not imply that the Bank seeks to mitigate or eliminate all risk. By defining and managing to a specific risk appetite, the board of directors and management ensure that there is a common understanding of the Bank s desired risk profile, which enhances strategic and tactical decisions. Additionally, the Bank aspires to (1) sustain a 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 corporate culture of transparency, integrity, and adherence to legal and ethical obligations: and (2) achieve best practices in governance, ethics, and compliance. 
 The Bank s board of directors and management have established a risk appetite statement and risk metrics for controlling and escalating actions based on the following eight continuing objectives in 2023 that represent the foundation of the Bank s strategic and tactical planning: 
 
 Capital Adequacy - maintain adequate levels of capital components (retained earnings and capital stock) that protect against the risks inherent in the Bank s business activities and provide sufficient resiliency to withstand potential stressed losses. 
 
 Credit and Concentration Risk - avoid credit losses by managing credit and collateral risk exposures within acceptable parameters. Achieve this objective through data-driven analysis and counterparty-specific analysis (and when appropriate, perform shareholder-specific analysis), monitoring and verification, including new collateral policy expansions to ensure appropriate controls and that monitoring is consistent with managing existing credit and collateral risk exposures. Monitor through enhanced reporting any elevated risk concentrations, and when appropriate, manage and mitigate the increased risk.

 The board and management recognize that risk and risk producing events are dynamic and ever-present. Accordingly, reporting, analyzing and mitigating risks are paramount to successful corporate governance. The board utilizes risk appetite metrics and monitoring analysis that reflect the board s risk appetite statement and the appropriate thresholds for action and reporting. 
 
 The Risk Management Policy (RMP) also governs the Bank s approach to managing the above risks. The Bank s board of directors reviews the RMP annually and approves amendments to the RMP from time to time as necessary. To promote compliance with the RMP, the Bank has established internal management committees to provide oversight of these risks. The Bank produces a comprehensive risk assessment report on an annual basis that is reviewed by the board of directors. In addition to the established risk appetite and the RMP, the Bank is also subject to Finance Agency regulations and policies regarding risk management.

 Market Risk 
 
 General 
 
 The Bank is exposed to market risk because changes in interest rates and spreads can have a direct effect on the value of the Bank s assets and liabilities. As a result of the volume of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest-rate risk component of market risk has the greatest impact on the Bank s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Interest rates are impacted by various factors, including the economic environment and other aspects affecting the financial and banking industry. 
 
 Interest-rate risk represents the risk that the aggregate market value or estimated fair value of the Bank s asset, liability, and derivative portfolios will decline as a result of interest-rate volatility or that net earnings will be affected significantly by interest-rate changes. Interest-rate risk can occur in a variety of forms including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and option risk. The Bank faces repricing risk whenever an asset and a liability reprice at different times and with different rates, resulting in interest-margin sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve may affect the market value of the Bank s assets and liabilities differently because a liability used to fund an asset may be short-term, while the asset is long-term, or vice versa. Basis risk occurs when yields on assets and costs on liabilities are based on different bases, such SOFR versus the Bank s cost of funds. Different bases can move at different rates or in different directions, which can cause erratic changes in revenues and expenses. Option risk is presented by the optionality that is embedded in some assets and liabilities. Mortgage assets represent the primary source of option risk. 
 
 The primary goal of the Bank s interest-rate risk measurement and management efforts is to control the above risks through prudent asset-liability management strategies so that the Bank may provide members with dividends that are consistently competitive with existing market interest rates on alternative short-term and variable-rate investments. The Bank attempts to manage interest-rate risk exposure by using appropriate funding instruments and hedging strategies. Hedging may occur at the micro level, for one or more specifically identified transactions, or at the macro level. Management evaluates the Bank s macro hedge position and funding strategies on a daily basis and makes adjustments as necessary. 
 
 The Bank measures its potential market risk exposure in a number of ways. These include asset, liability, and equity duration analyses; and earnings forecast scenario analyses that reflect repricing gaps. The Bank establishes tolerance limits for these financial metrics and uses internal models to measure each of these risk exposures at least monthly. 

Use of Derivatives 
 
 The Bank enters into derivatives to reduce the interest-rate risk exposure inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and funding positions and attempts to do so in the most cost-efficient manner. The Bank does not engage in speculative trading of these instruments. The Bank s derivative positions may include interest-rate swaps, options, swaptions, interest-rate cap and floor agreements, and forward contracts. These derivatives are used to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of financial instruments to achieve risk-management objectives. Within its risk management strategy, the Bank uses derivative financial instruments in the following two ways: 
 
 As a fair-value hedge of an underlying financial instrument or a firm commitment. For example, the Bank uses derivatives to reduce the interest-rate net sensitivity of consolidated obligations, advances, and investments by, in effect, converting them to a short-term interest rate. The Bank also uses derivatives to manage embedded options in assets and liabilities and to hedge the market value of existing assets and liabilities. The Bank s management reevaluates its hedging strategies from time to time and may change the hedging techniques used or adopt new strategies as deemed prudent. 
 
 As an asset-liability management tool, for which hedge accounting is not applied (non-qualifying hedge). The Bank may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the Bank recognizes the change in fair value and interest income or expense of these derivatives in the Noninterest income (loss) section of the Statements of Income as Net gains (losses) on derivatives with no offsetting fair-value adjustments of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment. Consequently, these transactions can introduce earnings volatility.

Interest-rate Risk Exposure Measurement 
 
 The Bank measures interest-rate risk exposure by various methods. The primary methods used are (1) calculating the effective duration of assets, liabilities, and equity under various scenarios; and (2) calculating the theoretical market value of equity. Effective duration, normally expressed in years or months, measures the price sensitivity of the Bank s interest-bearing assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. As effective duration lengthens, market-value changes become more sensitive to interest-rate changes. The Bank employs sophisticated modeling systems to measure effective duration. 
 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 Effective duration of equity aggregates the estimated sensitivity of market value for each of the Bank s financial assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. Effective duration of equity is computed by taking the market value-weighted effective duration of assets, less the market value-weighted effective duration of liabilities, and dividing the remainder by the market value of equity. Market value of equity is not indicative of the market value of the Bank as a going concern or the value of the Bank in a liquidation scenario. An effective duration gap is the measure of the difference between the estimated effective durations of portfolio assets and liabilities and summarizes the extent to which the estimated cash flows for assets and liabilities are matched, on average, over time and across interest-rate scenarios. 
 
 A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is greater than the effective duration of liabilities. A negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap results when the effective duration of assets is less than the effective duration of liabilities. A positive effective duration of equity or a positive effective duration gap generally indicates that the Bank has some exposure to interest-rate risk in a rising rate environment, and a negative effective duration of equity or a negative effective duration gap generally indicates some exposure to interest-rate risk in a declining interest-rate environment. Higher effective duration numbers, whether positive or negative, indicate greater volatility of market value of equity in response to changing interest rates. 
 
 Bank policy requires the Bank to maintain its effective duration of equity within a range of plus five years to minus five years, assuming current interest rates, and within a range of plus seven years to minus seven years, assuming an instantaneous parallel increase or decrease in market interest rates of 200 basis points. 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s effective duration exposure measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (in years). As of December 31, 2023 2022 Down 200 Basis Points

 ___________ 
 (1) The down 200 basis points scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks, intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists. The constrained shock scenario may not represent current expectations. 
 
 The Bank uses both sophisticated computer models and an experienced professional staff to measure the amount of interest-rate risk in the balance sheet, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in the Bank s models and will make adjustments to the Bank s assumptions and methodologies in response to rapid changes in economic conditions. 
 
 The prepayment risk in both advances and investment assets can significantly affect the Bank s effective duration of equity and effective duration gap. Current regulations require the Bank to mitigate advance prepayment risk by establishing prepayment fees that make the Bank financially indifferent to a borrower s decision to prepay an advance unless the advance contains explicit par value prepayment options. Bank policy establishes these prepayment fees. 
 The prepayment options embedded in mortgage loan and mortgage security assets may shorten or lengthen both the actual and expected cash flows when interest rates change. Current Finance Agency policies limit this source of interest-rate risk by limiting the types of MBS the Bank may own to those with defined estimated average life changes under specific interest-rate shock scenarios. These limits do not apply to mortgage loans purchased from members. The Bank typically hedges mortgage prepayment uncertainty by using callable debt as a funding source and by using interest-rate cap, floor, and swaption transactions. The Bank also uses derivatives to reduce effective duration and option risks for investment securities other than MBS. Effective duration and option risk exposures are measured on a regular basis for all investment assets under alternative rate scenarios. 
 
 The Bank also analyzes its interest-rate risk and market exposure by evaluating the theoretical market value of equity. The market value of equity represents the net result of the present value of future cash flows discounted to arrive at the theoretical market value of each balance sheet item. By using the discounted present value of future cash flows, the Bank is able to factor in the various maturities of assets and liabilities, similar to the effective duration analysis discussed above. The Bank determines the theoretical market value of assets and liabilities utilizing a pricing approach that is more fully described in Note

 14 Estimated Fair Values to the Bank s 2023 audited financial statements. The difference between the market value of total assets and the market value of total liabilities is the market value of equity. A more volatile market value of equity under different shock scenarios tends to result in a higher effective duration of equity, indicating increased sensitivity to interest rate changes. 
 
 The following table presents the Bank s market value of equity measurements as calculated in accordance with Bank policy (dollars in millions).

 (1) The down 200 basis points scenarios shown above are considered to be constrained shocks, intended to prevent the possibility of negative interest rates when a designated low rate environment exists. The constrained shock scenario may not represent current expectations. 
 
 Under the Bank s RMP, the Bank s market value of equity must not decline by more than 15 percent, assuming an immediate, parallel, and sustained interest-rate shock of 200 basis points in either direction. 
 
 If effective duration of equity or market value of equity is approaching the boundaries of the Bank s RMP ranges, management will initiate remedial action or review alternative strategies at the next meeting of the board of directors or appropriate committee thereof. 
 
 The scenarios above generally include numerous assumptions, including those related to changes in the balance sheet, interest rates, and prepayment trends. Such assumptions may change through time as a result of a host of factors, including changes in the balance sheet as well as the interest-rate environment. The modeling process is performed in a manner consistent with the Bank s policies and procedures with results reviewed on an on-going basis by the Bank. While all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest-rate sensitivity of the Bank, market conditions, the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on the Bank s assets, liabilities and equity. 

Liquidity Risk 
 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or meet the credit needs of its members and borrowers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The Bank s objective is to meet operational and member liquidity needs under all reasonable economic and operational situations. The Bank uses liquidity to absorb fluctuations in asset and liability balances and to provide an adequate reservoir of funding to support attractive and stable advance pricing. The Bank meets its liquidity needs from both asset and liability sources. 
 
 To address liquidity risk, the Bank uses cash flow scenario analysis and maturity gap analysis in compliance with regulatory requirements to confirm that the Bank has sufficient liquidity reserves, as discussed in further detail in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources above. 

Credit Risk 
 The Bank faces credit risk primarily with respect to its advances, investments, derivatives, and mortgage loan assets. 

Advances 
 
 Secured advances to member financial institutions account for the largest category of Bank assets; thus, advances are a major source of the Bank s credit risk exposure. The Bank uses a risk-focused approach to credit and collateral underwriting. The Bank attempts to reduce credit risk on advances by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and the quality and value of the assets that borrowers pledge as eligible collateral. 
 
 The Bank determines credit risk rating for its members by evaluating each institution s overall financial health, taking into account the quality of assets, earnings, and capital position. The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insured depository 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 institution a credit risk rating from 101 to 104 by utilizing an internal model (101 being the least amount of credit risk and 104 the greatest amount of credit risk). The Bank assigns each borrower that is an insurance company a credit risk rating from 101 to 104 by utilizing an external model. The Bank assigns each borrower that is not an insured depository institution or an insurance company (including housing associates, CDFIs, and corporate credit unions) a credit risk rating from 101 to 104 based on an internal risk matrix developed for each entity type. 
 In general, borrowers with the greatest amount of credit risk may have more restrictions on the types of collateral they may use to secure advances, may be required to maintain higher collateral maintenance levels and deliver loan collateral, may be restricted from obtaining further advances, and may face more stringent collateral reporting requirements. At times, based upon the Bank s assessment of a borrower and its collateral, the Bank may place more restrictive requirements on a borrower than those generally applicable to borrowers with the same rating. Management and the board also monitor the Bank s concentration in secured credit and standby letters of credit exposure to individual borrowers. 
 The following table presents the number of borrowers and the par value of advances outstanding to borrowers with the specified ratings as of the specified dates (dollars in millions). 
 As of December 31, 2023 2022 Rating Number of Borrowers Par Value of Outstanding Advances Number of Borrowers Par Value of Outstanding Advances 101 323 84,969 300 101,663 102 51 11,577 48 8,370 103 14 318 7 43 104 3 84 4 233 Total 391 96,948 359 110,309 
 
 The Bank establishes a credit limit for each borrower. The credit limit is not a committed line of credit, but rather an indication of the borrower s general borrowing capacity with the Bank. The Bank determines the credit limit in its sole and absolute discretion by evaluating a wide variety of factors that indicate the borrower s overall creditworthiness. The credit limit is generally expressed as a percentage equal to the ratio of the borrower s total liabilities to the Bank (including the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit, the par value of outstanding advances, and the total exposure of the Bank to the borrower under any derivative contract) to the borrower s total assets. Generally, borrowers are held to a credit limit of no more than 30 percent. However, the Bank s board of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, may approve a higher limit at its discretion, and such borrowers may be subject to certain additional collateral reporting and maintenance requirements. Five borrowers have been approved for a credit limit higher than 30 percent, however, none of these borrowers exceeded the 30 percent credit limit as of December 31, 2023, and their total outstanding advance and standby letters of credit balance was 13.5 billion and 810 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank obtains collateral on advances to protect against losses, but Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank to accept only certain types of collateral. Each borrower must maintain an amount of qualifying collateral that, when discounted to the lendable collateral value (LCV), is equal to at least 100 percent of the borrower s outstanding par value of all advances and other liabilities from the Bank. The LCV is the value that the Bank assigns to each type of qualifying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of credit that such qualifying collateral will support. For each type of qualifying collateral, the Bank discounts the market value of the qualifying collateral to calculate the LCV. The Bank regularly reevaluates the appropriate level of discounting. The Bank had rights to collateral on a borrower-by-borrower basis with an estimated value equal to or greater than its outstanding extension of credit as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The following table presents information about the types of collateral held for the Bank s advances (dollars in millions). 
 Total Par Value of Outstanding Advances LCV of Collateral Pledged by Members First Mortgage Collateral ) Securities Collateral ) Other Real Estate Related Collateral ) As of December 31, 2023 96,948 392,828 60.22 17.89 21.89 As of December 31, 2022 110,309 331,253 63.13 14.13 22.74 
 For purposes of determining each member s LCV, the Bank estimates the current market value of all residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit pledged as collateral based on information provided by the member on its loan portfolio or on individual loans through the regular collateral reporting process. The estimated market value is discounted to account for the (1) price volatility of loans, (2) model data uncertainty, and (3) estimated liquidation and servicing costs in the event of the member s default. Market values, and thus LCVs, change monthly. The use of this market-based valuation methodology allows the Bank to establish its collateral discounts with greater precision and to 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 provide greater transparency with respect to the valuation of collateral pledged for advances and other credit products offered by the Bank. 
 
 The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by any member of the Bank, or any affiliate of any such member, priority over the claims and rights of any party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee, or similar party having rights of a lien creditor), other than the claims and rights of a party that (1) would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and (2) is an actual bona fide purchaser for value or is an actual secured party whose security interest is perfected in accordance with applicable state law. Most members provide the Bank with a blanket lien covering substantially all of the member s real estate-related assets and their consent for the Bank to file a financing statement evidencing the blanket lien. The Bank requires delivery of cash and securities pledged to the Bank as collateral. Delivery of loan collateral is also required when pledged by insurance company, CDFI, or housing associate members. For most commercial bank and credit union members, delivery of loan collateral is not required. The Bank periodically works with commercial bank and credit union members to release collateral from the Bank s lien to permit such members to pledge those assets to support borrowings, or potential borrowings, from the Federal Reserve Banks discount window. 
 In its history, the Bank has never experienced a credit loss on an advance. In consideration of this and the Bank s policies and practices detailed above, the Bank has not established an allowance for credit losses on advances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Investments 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk on investments consisting of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold. These investments are generally transacted with government agencies and large financial institutions that are considered to be of investment quality. The Finance Agency defines investment quality as a security with adequate financial backing, so that full and timely payment of principal and interest on such security is expected, and there is minimal risk that the timely payment of principal and interest would not occur because of adverse changes in economic and financial conditions during the projected life of the security. 
 In addition to Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has established guidelines approved by its board of directors regarding unsecured extensions of credit, with respect to term limits and eligible counterparties. 
 Finance Agency regulations prohibit the Bank from investing in any of the following securities: 
 instruments, such as common stock, that represent an ownership interest in an entity, other than stock in small business investment companies, or certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; 
 instruments issued by non-U.S. entities, other than those issued by U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks; 
 debt instruments that are not of investment quality, other than certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities and instruments that the Bank determined became less than investment quality because of developments or events that occurred after purchase by the Bank; 
 whole mortgages or other whole loans, other than the following: (1) those acquired under the Bank s mortgage purchase programs; (2) certain investments targeted to low-income people or communities; (3) certain marketable direct obligations of state, local, or tribal government units or agencies that are of investment quality; (4) MBS or asset-backed securities that are backed by manufactured housing loans or home equity loans; and (5) certain foreign housing loans that are authorized under section 12(b) of the FHLBank Act; 
 interest-only or principal-only stripped MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations, and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs); 
 residual-interest or interest-accrual classes of CMOs and REMICs; 
 fixed-rate or variable-rate MBS, CMOs, and REMICs that are at rates equal to their contractual cap on the trade date and that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous interest-rate change of 300 basis points; and 
 non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. 
 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 Finance Agency regulations do not permit the Bank to rely exclusively on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) ratings with respect to its investments. The Bank is required to make a determination of whether a security is of investment quality based on its own documented analysis, which includes the NRSRO rating as one of the factors that is assessed to determine investment quality. The Bank monitors the financial condition of investment counterparties to ensure that they are in compliance with the Bank s RMP and Finance Agency regulations. Unsecured credit exposure to any counterparty is limited by the credit quality and capital of the counterparty and by the capital of the Bank. On a regular basis, management produces financial monitoring reports detailing the financial condition of the Bank s counterparties. These reports are reviewed by the Bank s board of directors. In addition to the Bank s RMP and regulatory requirements, the Bank may limit or suspend overnight and term trading. Limiting or suspending counterparties limits the pool of available counterparties, shifts the geographical distribution of counterparty exposure, and may reduce the Bank s overall investment opportunities. 
 The Bank only enters into investments with U.S. counterparties or U.S. branch offices of foreign banks that have been approved by the Bank through its internal approval process, but the Bank may still have exposure to foreign entities if a counterparty s parent entity is located in another country. The following tables present the Bank s gross exposure, by instrument type, according to the location of the parent company of the counterparty (dollars in millions).

 The Bank experienced an increase in unsecured credit exposure in its investment portfolio related to non-U.S. government and non-U.S. government agency counterparties to 10.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 from 9.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2023, Northern Trust Company (United States) and Royal Bank of Canada (Canada) each presented greater than 10.0 percent and collectively represented 33.7 percent of the total unsecured credit exposure to non-U.S. government or non-U.S. government agency counterparties. As of December 31, 2023, total unsecured credit portfolio consisted primarily of federal funds sold with overnight maturities. 
 The Bank s RMP permits the Bank to invest in U.S. agency (i.e., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) obligations including the following: (1) CMOs and REMICS that are backed by such securities; and (2) other MBS, CMOs, and REMICS that are of sufficient investment quality, which typically have the highest ratings issued by S P or Moody s at the time of purchase. In addition to NRSRO ratings, the Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, such as collateral performance, marketability, asset class considerations, local and regional economic conditions, and the financial health of the underlying issuer.

 Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell 
 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell are considered collateralized financing arrangements and effectively represent short-term loans transacted with counterparties that the Bank considers to be of investment quality. The terms of these loans are structured such that if the fair value of the underlying securities decreases below the fair value required as collateral, the counterparty must place an equivalent amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an equivalent amount of cash. If an agreement to resell is deemed to be impaired, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the agreement is recognized in earnings. 
 
 Available-for-sale Securities 
 
 Available-for-sale securities are evaluated at the individual security level for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the security s fair value to its amortized cost. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the Statements of Condition. Impairment exists when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost (i.e., in an unrealized loss position). In assessing whether a credit loss exists on an impaired security, the Bank considers whether there would be a shortfall in receiving all cash flows contractually due. In the case of U.S. obligations, they carry an explicit U.S. government guarantee and GSE securities are purchased under an assumption that the issuers obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored, taking into account their status as GSEs. Thus, the Bank considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero. When a shortfall is considered possible, the Bank compares the present value of cash flows to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows is less than amortized cost, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision (reversal) for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount of the unrealized loss. The allowance for credit losses excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, which is measured separately. If management intends to sell an impaired security classified as available-for-sale, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before expected recovery of its amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses is written off and the amortized cost basis is written down to the security s fair value at the reporting date with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. If management does not intend to sell an impaired security classified as available-for-sale and it is not more likely than not that management will be required to sell the debt security, then the credit portion of the difference is recognized as an allowance for credit losses and any remaining difference between the security s fair value and amortized cost is recorded as net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities within other comprehensive income (loss). The Bank has not established an allowance for credit loss on any of its available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023.

 Held-to-maturity Securities 
 
 Held-to-maturity securities are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses on a pool basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. If applicable, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding credit loss expense (or reversal of credit loss expense). The allowance for credit losses excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, which is measured separately. 
 
 The Bank evaluates its held-to-maturity securities for impairment on a collective, or pooled basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. The Bank has not established an allowance for credit loss on any of its held-to-maturity securities as of December 31, 2023 because the securities: (1) were all highly-rated and/or had short remaining terms to maturity, (2) had not experienced, nor did the Bank expect, any payment default on the instruments and (3) in the case of U.S. obligations, they carry an explicit U.S. government guarantee such that the Bank considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero, and (4) in the case of GSE securities, they are purchased under an assumption that the issuers obligation to pay principal and interest on those securities will be honored, taking into account their status as GSEs. 

Derivatives 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements, and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk. The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. The Bank is also required to follow the requirements set forth by applicable regulations. 
 
 The Bank s over-the-counter derivative transactions may either be (1) uncleared derivatives, which are executed bilaterally with a counterparty; or (2) cleared derivatives, which are cleared through a clearing agent with a Clearinghouse. Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Clearinghouse, the derivative transaction is novated, and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearinghouse as the counterparty. 
 
 For uncleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to nonperformance by counterparties. The Bank generally requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank s exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivatives as of December 31, 2023. 
 If the counterparty has an NRSRO rating, the net exposure after collateral is treated as unsecured credit, consistent with the Bank s RMP and Finance Agency regulations. If the counterparty does not have an NRSRO rating, the Bank requires collateral for the full amount of the exposure. 
 
 For cleared derivatives, the Bank is subject to credit risk due to nonperformance by the Clearinghouse and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, to the Clearinghouse, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives mitigates credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. This does introduce, however, a risk of concentration among the limited number of Clearinghouses and clearing agents. The Bank actively monitors Clearinghouses and clearing agents. An annual review of the Bank s Clearinghouses is performed, and the Bank also monitors its exposure to Clearinghouses on a monthly basis. The Bank currently utilized two approved Clearinghouses, CME Clearing and LCH Ltd. The Bank also monitors the clearing agents through its unsecured credit system, and the Bank subjects these clearing agents to the same limits as other bilateral derivative counterparties. The parent companies of the clearing agents are monitored through annual reviews, as well as through the Bank s daily monitoring tools, which include reviewing equity triggers, debt triggers, and credit default swap spread triggers. In addition, exposures to the clearing agents are monitored daily on a swap counterparty report. The Bank currently has two approved clearing agents, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs Co. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments; however, the Bank s maximum credit risk with respect to derivative transactions, is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is default, less the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables, as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities.

Mortgage Loan Programs 
 
 The Bank seeks to manage the credit risk associated with the MPP and the MPF Program by maintaining underwriting and eligibility standards and structuring possible losses into several layers to be shared with the PFIs. 
 
 Mortgage loans purchased under the MPP and MPF Program must comply with the underwriting and eligibility standards set forth in applicable MPP guidelines or MPF guidelines. In both MPP and MPF, the Bank and PFIs share the risk of losses on mortgage loans by structuring potential losses on conventional mortgage loans into layers with respect to each master commitment and in compliance with the applicable regulations governing the purchase of mortgage loans by the Bank.

Operational Risk 
 
 Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external events. Operational risk for the Bank also includes reputation and legal risks associated with business practices or market conduct that the Bank may undertake. Operational risk inherently is greatest where transaction processes include numerous processing steps, require greater subjectivity, or are non-routine. The Bank operates in a complex business environment and is subject to numerous regulatory requirements. 
 
 The Bank identifies risk through daily operational monitoring, independent reviews, and the strategic planning and risk assessment programs that both consider the operational risk ramifications of the Bank s business strategies and environment. The Bank has established comprehensive financial and operating policies and procedures to mitigate the likelihood of loss resulting from the identified operational risks. In addition, the Bank s Operational Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the Bank s risk management policies, procedures, strategies, and activities related to operational risks, including overseeing the monitoring process and review of risk assessments. This oversight also includes compliance risk and reputational risk. The Bank effects related changes in processes, information systems, lines of communication, and other internal controls as deemed appropriate in response to identified or anticipated increases in operational risk. 
 
 The board of directors has an Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee (EROC) to advise and assist the board with respect to enterprise risk management, operations, information technology, and other related matters. In addition, the Bank s internal Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) is responsible for the management and oversight of the Bank s risk management programs and practices. Additionally, the Bank s Internal Audit department, which reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Bank s board of directors, regularly tests compliance with the policies and procedures related to managing operational risks. 
 
 Cyber-Related Risks. The efficiencies offered by information technology (IT) are necessary components of Bank operations. The IT architecture supports multiple operating systems, database structures, and virtualized servers to support business applications that are a mixture of vendor-licensed and in-house developed. Cyber-attacks are increasing globally across all business sectors and cyber attackers are finding more ways to penetrate organizations systems. Cybersecurity threats can result in damage to the Bank s physical facilities, technology systems, and/or the Bank s intangible assets. Successful attacks can have a financial, legal, and reputational impact on the Bank as well as disrupt the Bank s ability to serve its shareholders. 
 The Bank s board of directors, through EROC, oversees the major dimensions of the Bank s information technology program including management of information systems to ensure alignment with the Bank s strategic plan, risk management activities, and operational performance standards. In that role, EROC oversees the development, implementation and maintenance of the Bank s information security program including recommending action to the board with respect to the Bank s information security policy on an annual basis and reviewing reports on the effectiveness of the Bank s information security program. The Bank s internal ERC reviews and reports to the board on the risk exposures and risk appetites of the Bank, including those related to information technology. In addition, the Bank s internal Information Technology Governance Committee oversees IT governance, including: IT risk management and IT operational performance, and the Bank s internal Security Governance

 Committee provides independent and integrated oversight of the information security program. Each of these committees provide information and make recommendations to the board, through the Bank s executive management committee, regarding their respective oversight authority. 

Business Risk 
 
 Business risk is the risk of an adverse effect on the Bank s profitability resulting from external factors that may occur in both the short- and the long-term. Business risk includes political, strategic, reputation, and regulatory events that are beyond the Bank s control. In particular, during 2023 and continuing into 2024, the Bank faces business risk, which may include changes in: 
 
 the overall economy; 
 
 the financial services industry or the Bank s competitive environment; and 
 
 legislation, regulation, or congressional scrutiny affecting the Bank or its members. 
 
 For discussion of the Bank s competition for advances, see Item 1. Business Competition above. For discussion of recent regulatory activity that may have a material impact on the Bank s operations, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Legislative and Regulatory Developments . The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through long-term strategic planning and through continually monitoring economic indicators and the external environment. 
 
 Cyclicality and Seasonality 
 
 The Bank s business and the demand for advances from the Bank are generally not subject to the effects of cyclical or seasonal variations, although the Bank s advance demand may vary based upon fluctuations of its members consumer credit liquidity needs. 
 
 Effects of Inflation 
 
 The majority of the Bank s assets and liabilities are, and will continue to be, monetary in nature. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, higher rates of inflation generally result in corresponding increases in interest rates. Inflation, coupled with increasing interest rates, generally has the following effects on the Bank: 
 
 the cost of the Bank s funds and operating overhead increases; 
 
 the yield on variable-rate assets held by the Bank increases; 
 
 the fair value of fixed-rate investments and mortgage loans held in portfolio decreases; and 
 
 mortgage loan prepayment rates decrease and result in lower levels of mortgage loan refinance activity, which may result in the reduction of Bank advances to members as increased rates tend to slow home sales. 
 
 Conversely, lower rates of inflation or deflation have the opposite effects of the above on the Bank and its holdings. 

Transition of LIBOR to an Alternative Reference Rate 
 
 Pursuant to the March 5, 2021 United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announcement, 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR ceased being provided by its administrator on December 31, 2021 and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings ceased being supported or published immediately after June 30, 2023. In keeping with the Bank s regulator and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee's recommendations and industry developments, the Bank has selected SOFR as its preferred primary replacement rate for investments and advances. The Bank ceased accepting newly originated LIBOR-linked collateral on January 1, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, the Bank has completed transition of all outstanding LIBOR-indexed instruments to reference SOFR, with the implementation of such fall back effective either immediately following June 30, 2023, or at the beginning of the instrument s next reset period following LIBOR cessation. The Bank has also considered the risks of any

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of the 
 Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of condition of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the FHLBank as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of capital and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the FHLBank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the FHLBank as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the FHLBank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The FHLBank's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the FHLBank s financial statements and on the FHLBank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the FHLBank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Valuation of Interest-Rate Related Derivatives and Hedged Items 
 
 As described in Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements, the FHLBank uses derivatives to reduce funding costs and to manage its exposure to interest-rate risks, among other objectives. The total notional amount of derivatives as of December 31, 2023 was 112 billion, of which 96 were designated as hedging instruments, and the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 was 523 million and 5 million, respectively. The fair values of interest-rate related derivatives and hedged items are calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which utilizes market-observable inputs. The significant assumptions used in the model include discount rates, market indices, and market volatility. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of interest-rate related derivatives and hedged items is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in evaluating the discount rates, market indices, and market volatility assumptions used to fair value these derivatives and hedged items, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of interest-rate related derivatives and hedged items, including controls over the model, data and assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent range of prices for a sample of interest-rate related derivatives and hedged items and comparison of management s estimate to the independently developed ranges. Developing the independent range of prices involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing the discount rates, market indices, and market volatility assumptions.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 Note 1 
 
 district Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks). Each FHLBank operates as a separate entity within a defined geographic district and has its own management, employees, and board of directors. The Bank s defined geographic district includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that were organized under the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (FHLBank Act), to serve the public by enhancing the availability of credit for residential mortgages and targeted community developments. The primary function of the Bank is to provide readily available, competitively priced funding to its member institutions. 
 
 The Bank is a cooperative whose member institutions own substantially all of the capital stock of the Bank. Former members and certain non-members, which own the Bank s capital stock as a result of a merger or acquisition of a member of the Bank, own the remaining capital stock to support business transactions still carried on the Bank s Statements of Condition. All holders of the Bank s capital stock are entitled to receive dividends on their capital stock, to the extent declared by the Bank s board of directors. 
 
 Federally-insured depository institutions, insurance companies, privately-insured state-chartered credit unions, and community development financial institutions that are located in the Bank s defined geographic district and engaged in residential housing finance are eligible to apply for membership. All members must purchase and hold capital stock of the Bank. A member s stock requirement is based on the amount of its total assets, as well as the amount of certain of its business activities with the Bank. Housing associates (including state and local housing authorities) that meet certain statutory criteria may also borrow from the Bank. While they are eligible to borrow, housing associates are not members of the Bank and are not allowed to hold capital stock. The Bank does not sponsor any special purpose entities or any other types of off-balance sheet conduits. 
 
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency), an independent agency in the executive branch of the U.S. government, supervises and regulates the FHLBanks and is responsible for ensuring that the FHLBanks (1) operate in a safe and sound manner, including that they maintain adequate capital and internal controls; (2) foster liquid, efficient, competitive, and resilient national housing finance markets through their operations and activities; (3) comply with applicable laws and regulations; and (4) carry out their housing finance mission through authorized activities that are consistent with the public interest. The Finance Agency also establishes policies and regulations covering the operations of the FHLBanks. 
 
 The Federal Home Loan Banks Office of Finance (Office of Finance), a joint office of the FHLBanks, facilitates the issuance and servicing of the FHLBanks debt instruments, known as consolidated obligations, and prepares the combined quarterly and annual financial reports of the FHLBanks. As provided by the FHLBank Act and applicable regulations, the Bank s consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. Consolidated obligations are the primary source of funds for the Bank in addition to deposits, other borrowings, and capital stock issued to members. The Bank primarily uses these funds to provide advances to members. The Bank also provides members and non-members with correspondent banking services, such as safekeeping, wire transfer, and cash management services.

 FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations of each of the FHLBanks. The Finance Agency, at its discretion, may require any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, whether or not the consolidated obligation represents a primary liability of such FHLBank. Although it has never occurred, to the extent that an FHLBank makes any payment on a consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank that is primarily liable for such consolidated obligation, Finance Agency regulations provide that the paying FHLBank is entitled to reimbursement from the noncomplying FHLBank for any payments made on its behalf and any other associated costs (including interest to be determined by the Finance Agency). However, if the Finance Agency determines that the noncomplying FHLBank is unable to satisfy its repayment obligations, the Finance Agency may allocate the outstanding liabilities of the noncomplying FHLBank among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding. The Finance Agency reserves the right to allocate the outstanding liabilities for the consolidated obligations among the FHLBanks in any other manner it may determine to ensure that the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner. The par value of the FHLBanks outstanding consolidated obligations, including consolidated obligations issued by the Bank, was and as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 General Terms. Consolidated obligations are issued with either fixed- or variable-rate coupon payment terms and may use a variety of indices for interest-rate resets including the SOFR and others. To meet the expected specific needs of certain investors in consolidated obligations, both fixed- and variable-rate consolidated obligation bonds may contain certain features, which may result in complex coupon payment terms and call options. When such consolidated obligations are issued, the Bank generally enters into derivatives containing offsetting features that, in effect, convert the terms of the consolidated obligation bond to those of a simple variable-rate consolidated obligation bond. 
 
 These consolidated obligations, beyond having fixed-rate or simple variable-rate coupon payment terms, may also have the following broad term regarding either principal repayment or coupon payment terms: 
 
 Optional Principal Redemption Consolidated Obligation Bonds (callable bonds) that the Bank may redeem in whole or in part at its discretion on predetermined call dates according to the terms of the consolidated obligation bond offerings. 
 
 With respect to interest payments, consolidated obligation bonds may have the following term in addition to fixed-rate and simple variable-rate payment terms: 
 
 Step-up/down Consolidated Obligation Bonds have coupons at fixed rates for specified intervals over the lives of the consolidated obligation bonds. At the end of each specified interval, the coupon rate increases (or decreases) or steps up (or steps down). These consolidated obligation bond issues generally contain call provisions enabling the bonds to be called at the Bank s discretion.

 percent of its income subject to assessment for the AHP, or such additional prorated sums as may be required so that the aggregate annual contribution of the FHLBanks is not less than . For purposes of the AHP calculation, each FHLBank s income subject to assessment is defined as the individual FHLBank s net income before assessments, plus interest expense related to mandatorily redeemable capital stock. The Bank accrues this expense monthly based on its income subject to assessment. The Bank reduces the AHP liability as members use subsidies. 
 
 If the Bank experienced a net loss during a quarter but had income subject to assessment in subsequent quarters, it would be required to contribute additional amounts to meet its calculated annual obligation based on the Bank s year-to-date income subject to assessment. If the Bank experienced a net loss for a full year, the Bank would have no obligation to the AHP for the year since each FHLBank s required annual AHP contribution is limited to its annual income subject to assessment. If the aggregate of percent of income subject to assessment for all FHLBanks was less than , each FHLBank would be required to contribute additional amounts so that the aggregate contribution of the FHLBanks equals the required . Each FHLBanks prorated contribution would be determined based on its income in relation to the income of all FHLBanks for the previous year. There was no shortfall in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. If an FHLBank finds that its required contributions are contributing to the financial instability of that FHLBank, it may apply to the Finance Agency for a temporary suspension of its contributions. No FHLBank made such an application in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021. The Bank had outstanding principal in AHP-related advances of and as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 regulatory capital requirements under its capital plan, the FHLBank Act, and Finance Agency regulations. 
 
 Risk-Based Capital . The Bank must maintain, at all times, permanent capital in an amount at least equal to the sum of its credit risk capital requirement, its market risk capital requirement, and its operational risk capital requirement, calculated in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Finance Agency. Permanent capital is defined by the FHLBank Act and regulations as the sum of retained earnings and the amounts paid-in for Class B stock. Only permanent capital satisfies the risk-based capital requirement. The Finance Agency may require the Bank to maintain a greater amount of permanent capital than is required by the risk-based capital requirement as defined. 
 
 Total Regulatory Capital . The FHLBank Act requires the Bank to maintain total regulatory capital in an amount equal to at least percent of total assets at all times. Total regulatory capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital, the amounts paid-in for Class A stock (if any), the amount of the Bank s general allowance for losses (if any), and the amount of any other instruments identified in the capital plan and approved by the Finance Agency. The Bank has not issued any Class A stock, has no general allowance for losses, and has no other instruments identified in the capital plan and approved by the Finance Agency; therefore, the Bank s total regulatory capital is equal to its permanent capital as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Total regulatory capital does not include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) but does include mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
 
 Leverage Capital . The FHLBank Act requires the Bank to maintain leverage capital in an amount equal to at least percent of total assets at all times. Leverage capital is defined as the sum of permanent capital weighted times and all other components of total capital. Although mandatorily redeemable capital stock is not included in capital for financial reporting purposes, such outstanding stock is considered capital for determining compliance with these regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Total regulatory capital ratio Total regulatory capital Leverage capital ratio Leverage capital 
 
 The Bank s Capital Plan provides for subclasses of Class B stock, as follows: 
 
 shares of subclass B1 capital stock are issued to meet the membership stock requirement under the capital plan; 
 
 shares of subclass B2 capital stock are issued to meet the advances activity-based stock requirement under the capital plan; and 
 
 shares of subclass B3 capital stock are issued to meet the standby letters of credit activity-based stock requirement under the capital plan. 
 
 Each subclass of Class B stock is issued, redeemed, and repurchased at a par value of 100 per share. Member shares cannot be purchased or sold except between the Bank and its members at 100 per share par value. The minimum stock requirement for each member is the sum of the membership stock requirement and the activity-based stock requirements. The capital plan permits the Bank s board of directors to set the membership and activity-based stock requirements within a range as set forth in the capital plan. Activity-based stock held by a member is that amount of subclass B2 or B3 capital stock that the member is required to own for as long as certain transactions between the Bank and the member remain outstanding. The manner in which the activity-based stock requirement is determined under the capital plan is set forth below.

 percent (five basis points) to percent (seven basis points) of a member s total assets and the dollar cap was increased from to . The membership stock requirement is recalculated using the member s total assets as of the preceding calendar year-end at least annually by March 31. 
 
 Subclass B2 capital stock. The Bank s board of directors approved an increase to the B2 activity-based stock requirement from percent to percent of the member s outstanding par value of advances, effective August 25, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the advances activity-based stock requirement was an amount of subclass B2 capital stock equal to the sum of the following: 
 
 percent of the member s outstanding par value of advances; and 
 
 percent of any outstanding targeted debt or equity investments (such as multifamily residential mortgage loan assets) sold by the member to the Bank on or after December 17, 2004, although none of these investments were outstanding as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The advances activity-based stock requirement also may include a percentage of any outstanding balance of acquired member assets (such as residential mortgage loan assets) although this percentage was set at as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 Subclass B3 capital stock . As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the standby letters of credit activity-based requirement was an amount equal to percent (10 basis points) of members outstanding standby letters of credit. 
 
 The FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations require that the minimum stock requirement for members must be sufficient to enable the Bank to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirement. Therefore, from time to time, the Bank s board of directors may adjust the membership stock requirement and the activity-based stock requirement within specified ranges set forth in the capital plan. Any adjustment outside the ranges would require an amendment to the capital plan and Finance Agency approval. Each member is required to comply promptly with any adjustment to the minimum stock requirement. 
 
 The FHLBank Act provides that the Bank may repurchase, at its sole discretion, any member s capital stock investment that exceeds the required minimum amount (excess capital stock). Under certain circumstances, Finance Agency regulations limit the ability of the Bank to create member excess stock. The Bank may not pay dividends in the form of capital stock or issue excess capital stock to any member if the Bank s excess capital stock exceeds one percent of its total assets or if the issuance of excess capital stock would cause the Bank s excess capital stock to exceed one percent of its total assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank s excess capital stock did not exceed one percent of its total assets. 
 
 A member may redeem its excess Class B capital stock at par value payable in cash five years after providing written notice to the Bank. The Bank, at its option, may repurchase a member s excess capital stock before expiration of the five-year notice period. The Bank s authority to redeem or repurchase capital stock is subject to a number of limitations. 
 
 Under Finance Agency regulations, the Bank s board of directors may, but is not required to, declare and pay non-cumulative dividends in cash or capital stock from unrestricted retained earnings and current earnings. All shares of capital stock share in any dividend without preference. Dividends are computed on the average daily balance of capital stock outstanding during the relevant time period. The Bank may not pay a dividend if the Bank is not in compliance with any of its regulatory capital requirements or if a payment would cause the Bank to fail to meet any of its regulatory capital requirements.

 The Pentegra Plan s annual valuation process includes separately calculating the plan s funded status and the funded status of each participating employer. The funded status is defined as the fair value of assets divided by the funding target (100 percent of the present value of all benefit liabilities accrued at that date). As permitted by ERISA, the Pentegra Plan accepts contributions for the prior plan year up to eight and a half months after the asset valuation date. As a result, the fair value of assets at the valuation date (July 1) will increase by any subsequent contributions designated for the immediately preceding plan year ended June 30. 
 
 The most recent Form 5500 available for the Pentegra Plan is for the year ended June 30, 2022. The contributions made by the Bank during 2023 were not more than five percent of the total contributions for the Pentegra Plan year ended June 30, 2022, and contributions made during 2022 were not more than five percent of the total contributions for the Pentegra Plan year ended June 30, 2021.

 years with variable or fixed rates and may include early termination features or options. The Bank may use derivatives to adjust the repricing and/or options characteristics of advances in order to more closely match the characteristics of the Bank s funding liabilities. In general, whenever a member executes a fixed- or a variable-rate advance with embedded options, the Bank simultaneously will execute a derivative with terms that offset the terms and embedded options in the advance. For example, the Bank may hedge a fixed-rate advance with an interest-rate swap in which the Bank pays a fixed-rate coupon and receives a variable-rate coupon, effectively converting the fixed-rate advance to a variable-rate advance. This type of hedge is typically treated as a fair-value hedge. 
 Mortgage Assets. The Bank has invested in mortgage assets. The prepayment options embedded in mortgage assets may shorten or lengthen the expected repayment of these investments, depending on changes in estimated prepayment speeds. The Bank manages the interest-rate and prepayment risk associated with mortgages through a combination of debt issuance and derivatives. The Bank issues both callable and non-callable debt to achieve cash flow patterns and liability durations similar to those expected on the mortgage loans. The Bank may use derivatives to match the expected prepayment characteristics of the mortgages. 
 Options (interest-rate caps, interest-rate floors and/or options) also may be used to hedge prepayment risk on the mortgages. Many options are not identified to specific mortgages and therefore, do not receive fair-value or cash-flow hedge accounting treatment. The Bank also may purchase interest-rate caps and floors, swaptions, callable swaps, calls, and puts to minimize the

 Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives 
 
 The Bank is subject to credit risk to its derivative transactions due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties and manages this risk through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in its policies, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, and Finance Agency regulations. 
 
 For uncleared derivatives, the degree of credit risk depends on the extent to which master netting arrangements are included in such contracts to mitigate the risk. The Bank requires collateral agreements with collateral delivery thresholds on all uncleared derivatives. Additionally, collateral related to derivatives with member institutions includes collateral assigned to the Bank, as evidenced by a written security agreement, and held by the member institution for the benefit of the Bank. 
 
 For cleared derivatives, the Clearinghouse is the Bank s counterparty. The Clearinghouse notifies the clearing agent of the required initial and variation margin, and the clearing agent notifies the Bank. The Bank utilizes two Clearinghouses for all cleared derivative transactions, CME Clearing and LCH Ltd. At both Clearinghouses, variation margin is characterized as daily settlement payments, and initial margin is considered cash collateral. Because the Bank is required to post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent to the Clearinghouse, it exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk if the clearing agent or the Clearinghouse fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties, and collateral/payments is posted daily through a clearing agent for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. The Bank has analyzed the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in its cleared derivative transactions and determined that the exercise of those offsetting rights by a non-defaulting party under these transactions should be upheld under applicable law upon an event of default, including a bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding involving the Clearinghouse or the Bank s clearing agent, or both. Based on this analysis, the Bank presents a net derivative receivable or payable for all of its transactions through a particular clearing agent with a particular Clearinghouse. 
 
 The Bank presents derivative instruments and the related cash collateral that is received or pledged, plus the associated accrued interest, on a net basis by clearing agent and/or by counterparty when it has met the netting requirements.

The Bank issues standby letters of credit on behalf of its members to support certain obligations of the members to third-party beneficiaries. Standby letters of credit may be offered to assist members and non-member housing associates in facilitating residential housing finance, community lending, and asset-liability management, and to provide liquidity. In particular, members often use standby letters of credit as collateral for deposits from federal and state government agencies. Standby letters of credit are executed for members for a fee. If the Bank is required to make a payment for a beneficiary's draw, the member either reimburses the Bank for the amount drawn or, subject to the Bank's discretion, the amount drawn may be converted into a collateralized advance to the member and will require a corresponding activity-based capital stock purchase. However, standby letters of credit usually expire without being drawn upon. 
 
 The carrying value of the guarantees related to standby letters of credit is recorded in Other liabilities on the Statements of Condition and amounted to and as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Such increases are not expected to have a material effect on the Bank s results of operations. 
 The Bank may be subject to various legal proceedings and actions from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of those matters presently known to the Bank will have a material effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Bank s President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Certifying Officers) are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its Certifying Officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Bank s management, with the participation of the Certifying Officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Bank in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act (1) is accumulated and communicated to the Bank s management, including the Certifying Officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (2) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. 
 
 In designing and evaluating the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures, the Bank s Certifying Officers recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Bank s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Bank, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Bank s management assessed the effectiveness of the Bank s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Bank s management utilized the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded that the Bank s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of the Bank s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears within. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, there were no changes in the Bank s internal control over financial reporting that have affected materially, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, the Bank s internal control over financial reporting.

PART III 

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. 
 
 Directors 
 
 The FHLBank Act provides that an FHLBank s board of directors is to comprise 13 directors, or such other number as the Director of the Finance Agency determines appropriate. For 2024, the Director has designated 14 directorships for the Bank, eight of which are member directorships and six of which are independent directorships. In 2023, the Bank s board of directors was comprised of eight member directors and six independent directors. 
 
 All individuals serving as Bank directors must be U.S. citizens. At least a majority of the directors must be member directors and not less than two-fifths must be independent directors. Under the FHLBank Act, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, and Finance Agency regulations, the term of office of each director is four years, subject to certain adjustments to achieve a staggered board. Any director that has been elected to three consecutive full terms is not eligible for election to directorship for any term that begins within two years of the expiration of the third term. 
 
 The board of directors does not solicit proxies, nor are member institutions permitted to solicit or use proxies in order to cast their votes in an election. The Bank prepares and delivers a ballot to each member that was a member as of the record date. 
 
 Member Directors 
 
 Candidates for member directorships in a particular state are nominated by members in that state. FHLBank boards are not permitted to nominate or elect member directors, except for vacant member directorships. Finance Agency regulations require that: 
 
 a member directorship be held only by an officer or director of a member institution located within the Bank s district; 
 
 the member institution meet all minimum capital requirements established by its regulator(s); and 
 
 the member institution be a member as of the record date established for the election of the member director. 
 
 The Bank is not permitted to establish additional eligibility criteria or qualifications for member directorships. With respect to member directors, under Finance Agency regulations, no director, officer, employee, attorney, or agent of the Bank (except in their personal capacity) may, directly or indirectly, support the nomination or election of a particular individual for a member directorship. 
 
 For each member director position to be filled, an eligible member in that state may cast one vote for each share of capital stock it was required to hold as of the record date, except that an eligible member s votes for each member director position to be filled may not exceed the average number of shares of capital stock required to be held by all of the members in that state as of the record date. 
 
 The regulations permit, but do not require, the board of directors to conduct an annual assessment of the skills and experience possessed by the members of its board of directors and to determine whether the capabilities of the board would be enhanced through the addition of individuals with particular skills and experience. The Bank may identify those qualifications and inform the members as part of its election notification process, however, the Bank may not exclude a member director candidate from the election ballot on the basis of such qualifications. In 2023, the board of directors conducted an assessment of its directors, but did not identify any particular qualifications as part of its 2023 election notification process.

Table of Content 

 Independent Directors 
 
 Candidates for independent directorships are nominated by the Bank s board of directors. Finance Agency regulations require that an independent directorship be held only by an individual: 
 
 who is a bona fide resident of the Bank s district; 
 
 who is not a director, officer, or employee of a member institution or of any recipient of advances from the Bank; and 
 
 who is not an officer of any FHLBank. 
 
 At least two of the independent directors must be public interest directors. Finance Agency regulations define a public interest independent director as someone having more than four years of experience representing consumer or community interests in banking services, credit needs, housing or consumer financial protection. The other independent directors must have experience in, or knowledge of, one or more of the following areas: auditing and accounting, derivatives, financial management, organizational management, project development, risk management practices, and the law. 
 
 Any individual may submit an application form and request to be considered by the Bank to be an independent director candidate. Before nominating any individual for an independent directorship, other than for a public interest directorship, the Board must determine that the candidate s knowledge or experience is commensurate with that needed to oversee a financial institution with a size and complexity that is comparable to the Bank s. Finance Agency regulations require the board to consult with the Bank s Affordable Housing Advisory Council with respect to the independent directorship candidates. Further, the Bank must submit information about independent directorship candidates to the Finance Agency for its review prior to their nomination. After the independent director candidates are nominated by the board, the candidates are then presented to the Bank s membership for a district-wide vote. Finance Agency regulations permit the Bank s directors, officers, attorneys, employees, agents, and Advisory Council members to support the candidacy of the board s candidates for independent directorships. 
 
 For independent directorships, candidates are elected on a district-wide basis, and the candidate(s) receiving the most votes is declared the winner. Candidates running unopposed must receive at least 20 percent of the number of votes eligible to be cast. If an unopposed candidate receives less than 20 percent of eligible votes, a new election must be conducted. 
 
 Board Vacancies 
 
 When the board has a vacancy, Finance Agency regulations require the board to elect a director to fill the vacancy by a majority vote of the remaining directors. 
 
 The Bank has determined that all directors meet the regulatory eligibility requirements for directors. Because of the laws and regulations governing member directorship elections that are described above, the Bank is not in a position to know what specific factors the Bank s member institutions may consider in selecting member director candidates or electing member directors. For the Bank s independent directors and the directors who hold their current directorship due to vacancy and appointment by the board, other than examining eligibility, the board considered the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills described in the biographical paragraphs provided below in determining to nominate that person as a director for the Bank. In addition, when making nominations, the board has at times considered the importance of maintaining a continuity of relevant knowledge, leadership and experience on the board and the diversity of thought, perspective, and experience the candidate would bring to the board.

 Code of Conduct 
 
 The board has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to the Bank s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, in each case, who are employees of the Bank. The Code of Conduct is posted on the Who We Are - Investor Relations - Governance section of the Bank s Internet website at http://corp.fhlbatl.com/who-we-are/investor-relations/. Any amendments to, or waivers under, the Bank s Code of Conduct that are required to be disclosed pursuant to the SEC s rules will be disclosed on the Bank s website. 
 
 Director Independence, Compensation Committee, Audit Committee, and Audit Committee Financial Expert 
 
 General 
 
 The board of directors of the Bank is required to evaluate the independence of the directors as described under the Independent Directors heading above, and under two distinct director independence standards. First, Finance Agency regulations establish independence criteria for directors who serve as members of the Bank s Audit Committee. Second, SEC rules require that the Bank s board of directors apply the independence criteria of a national securities exchange or automated quotation system in assessing the independence of its directors. 
 
 As of the date of this Report, the Bank has 14 directors, eight of whom are member directors and six of whom are independent directors under Finance Agency Regulations. None of the Bank s directors is an inside director. That is, none of the Bank s directors is a Bank employee or officer. Further, as the Bank s capital stock may only be owned by members, former members, and certain non-members, the Bank s directors cannot personally own stock or stock options in the Bank. However, each of the member directors is an officer or director of an institution that is a member of the Bank and that is encouraged to, and does, engage in transactions with the Bank on a regular basis. 
 
 Finance Agency Regulations Regarding Independence for Audit Committee composition 
 
 The Finance Agency s director independence standards prohibit an individual from serving as a member of the Bank s Audit Committee if he or she has one or more disqualifying relationships with the Bank or its management that would interfere with the exercise of that individual s independent judgment. Disqualifying relationships considered by the board are: employment with the Bank at any time during the last five years; acceptance of compensation from the Bank other than for service as a director; being a consultant, advisor, promoter, underwriter, or legal counsel for the Bank at any time within the last five years; and being an immediate family member of an individual who is or who has been within the past five years, a Bank executive officer. The board assesses the independence of each director under the Finance Agency s independence standards, regardless of whether he or she serves on the Audit Committee. As of March 8, 2024, each of the Bank s directors was independent under these criteria. 
 
 SEC Rules Regarding Independence 
 
 SEC rules require the Bank s board of directors to adopt a standard of independence to evaluate its directors. The board has adopted the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to determine which of its directors are independent, including members of its Governance and Compensation Committee and Audit Committee, and whether the Bank s Audit Committee s financial experts are independent. 
 
 After applying the NYSE independence standards, the board determined that, as of March 8, 2024, directors Casiano, Dewey, McKinney, McLaughlin, Payne, and Rucker are each an independent director. Based upon the fact that each member director is a senior official of an institution that is a member of the Bank (and thus is an equity holder in the Bank), that each such institution may routinely engage in transactions with the Bank, and that such transactions occur frequently and are encouraged, the board determined that none of the member directors presently meets the independence criteria under the NYSE independence standards. 
 
 It is possible that under the NYSE objective criteria for independence (particularly the criterion regarding the amount of business conducted with the Bank by the director s institution), a member director could meet the independence standard on a particular day. However, because the amount of business conducted by a member director s institution may change frequently, and because the Bank generally desires to increase the amount of business it conducts with each member, the directors deemed it inappropriate to draw distinctions among the member directors based upon the amount of business conducted with the Bank by any director s institution at a specific time.

Compensation Committee 
 
 The board has a Governance and Compensation Committee, composed of directors Dunlap, DeFerie, Rucker, Arriola, Harvard, McLaughlin, Payne and Whaley. As the Bank s Governance and Compensation Committee may only recommend actions to the full board regarding governance practices and compensation and benefits programs, which the full board may approve or disapprove, the board assesses the independence of the full board under the NYSE s standards for compensation committees. The board determined that, as of March 8, 2024, each of directors Casiano, Dewey, McKinney, McLaughlin, Payne, and Rucker was independent under the NYSE independence standards for compensation committee members, but for the reasons noted above, none of the member directors are independent under such standards. 
 
 Audit Committee 
 
 The board has a standing Audit Committee, composed of directors Dunlap, DeFerie, Lusk, Arriola, Casiano, Dewey, McKinney and Payne. The board determined that, as of March 8, 2024, each of directors Casiano, Dewey, McKinney and Payne was independent under the NYSE independence standards for audit committee members, but, for the reasons noted above, none of the member directors serving on the Audit Committee was independent under such standards. The board also determined that each of directors Dunlap, DeFerie, Lusk, Arriola, Dewey and McKinney is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of the SEC rules. 
 
 The board also assesses the independence of the Audit Committee members under Section 10A (m)(3) of the Exchange Act. As of March 8, 2024, each of the Bank s directors was independent under these criteria. As stated above, the board determined that each member of the Audit Committee was independent under the Finance Agency s standards applicable to the Bank s Audit Committee. 
 
 Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
 
 The directors are nominated and elected in accordance with applicable law and Finance Agency regulations. As required by applicable law, the chair and vice chair of the board are elected by a majority of all the directors of the Bank from among the directors of the Bank for two year terms, and since Bank officers may not serve as directors of the Bank, neither the board chair or vice chair position can be filled by the president and chief executive officer of the Bank. 
 
 The board of directors establishes the Bank s risk management culture, including risk tolerances and risk management philosophies, by establishing its risk management system, overseeing its risk management activities, and adopting its risk appetite and RMP. The board reviews the risk appetite report on a quarterly basis and approves any changes as appropriate. The board receives regular updates on the Bank s key risks including an independent risk assessment. The board reviews the RMP at least annually and approves any amendments to it as appropriate. For further discussion of the risk appetite and the RMP, please see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Risk Management . The board works with management to align the Bank s strategic activities and objectives within the parameters of the risk appetite framework and the RMP. The board utilizes committees as an integral part of overseeing risk management, including an audit committee, a credit and member services committee, an enterprise risk and operations committee, an executive committee, a finance committee, a governance and compensation committee, and a housing and community investment committee, with the following oversight responsibilities: 
 
 Audit Committee oversees the Bank s financial reporting process, system of internal control, audit process, policies and procedures for assessing and monitoring implementation of the strategic plan, and the Bank s process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations. 
 
 Credit and Member Services Committee oversees the Bank s credit and collateral policies and related programs, services, products and documentation, and the Bank s credit and collateral risk management program, strategies, and activities. 
 
 Enterprise Risk and Operations Committee oversees the Bank s enterprise risk management functions, operations, information technology, cybersecurity and other related matters. 
 
 Executive Committee exercises most of the powers of the board in the management and direction of the affairs of the Bank during the intervals between board meetings.

 Finance Committee oversees matters affecting the Bank s financial performance, capital management and other related matters, including the Bank s market and liquidity risk management program, strategies, and activities. 
 
 Governance and Compensation Committee oversees the Bank s governance practices, compensation and benefits programs, and other related matters. 
 
 Housing and Community Investment Committee oversees the Bank s housing and community investment policies, programs, and other relevant matters, including any other Bank products, services, and programs that may provide grants, subsidies, or other forms of assistance to support affordable housing and community economic development for low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. 
 
 The Bank s internal management is overseen by the president and chief executive officer and delegated to other senior managers and internal management committees. The Bank has determined that this leadership structure is the most effective means of actively engaging the board of directors in risk management oversight while utilizing Bank management to implement and maintain sound risk management practices. 
 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 
 The board has a Governance and Compensation Committee that recommends actions to the full board regarding governance practices and compensation and benefits programs, which the full board of directors may approve or disapprove. None of the directors serving on the board in 2023 has at any time been an officer or employee with the Bank. None of the Bank s executive officers served during 2023 or is serving on the board of directors or the compensation committee of any entity whose executive officers served on the Bank s board of directors.

 Philosophy and Objectives 
 
 The Bank s compensation philosophy and objectives are to attract, motivate, and retain high caliber financial services executives capable of achieving strategic business initiatives, enhancing business performance and increasing member value. The Bank s compensation program is designed to reward this performance and enhanced value and to offer competitive compensation elements that align its executives incentives with the interests of its members. To mitigate unnecessary or excessive risk-taking by executive management, the Bank s incentive compensation plan contains overall Bank performance goals that are dependent on an aggregation of transactions throughout the Bank and that cannot be individually altered by executive management. The incentive compensation plan contains quantitative components that are evaluated by the board of directors. Additionally, the board of directors maintains discretionary authority over all incentive compensation awards, giving the board of directors the flexibility to review Bank performance throughout the year and to adjust incentive compensation accordingly. 
 
 Elements of Compensation 
 
 The Bank compensates its executive officers with a combination of base salary, incentive compensation, and benefits. The Bank is unable to offer equity-related compensation because it is a cooperative, and only member financial institutions may own its capital stock. Accordingly, the Bank offers other compensation elements, such as qualified and non-qualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, to motivate long-term performance and encourage retention. Because the Bank is exempt from federal taxes, the deductibility of compensation is not relevant to compensation plan design. The elements of the Bank s compensation program for executive officers, and the objective of each compensation element, are described below. 
 
 Base salary . Base salary is established on the basis of the ongoing duties associated with managing a particular set of functions at the Bank and provides an amount of fixed compensation. Each executive s base salary is also used as a basis in calculating the executive s annual incentive award opportunity, as described below. 
 
 Incentive compensation . The Bank provides an annual cash award opportunity under its Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) to executive officers based on the achievement of quantitative goals set and evaluated by the board of directors. To promote consistently high corporate performance on a long-term basis and enhance the retention of key senior executive officers, payment of fifty percent of any ICP granted to a named executive officer is deferred and distributed over a three-year period, together with positive or negative returns (Deferred Incentives). The named executive officers ICP awards and Deferred Incentives are subject to adjustment or forfeiture in certain events as described below under 2023 Weights and Awards- Incentive Compensation Plan Award Adjustment or Forfeiture . 
 
 Benefits . The Bank provides retirement benefits to promote executive retention, and the executive officers are eligible to participate in the same benefit plans that are made available to other employees of the Bank, such as health, group term life and long-term disability coverage. The Bank also provides limited perquisites to executive officers. 
 
 Executive Compensation Process 
 
 Board and committee consideration of executive compensation. The Bank s board of directors establishes the Bank s executive compensation philosophy and objectives and has final approval of any compensation decisions related to the Bank s chief executive officer (CEO), all officers reporting directly to the CEO who are senior vice presidents or higher, and any officer determined to be a named executive officer in the prior year. The governance and compensation committee of the board of directors advises and assists the board and makes recommendations to the board relating to compensation of such officers. 
 
 122 

Table of Content 

 The CEO reviews and recommends to the board the base salary of the officers who report directly to him and who are senior vice president and higher level officers. The CEO also approves the base salary of all other senior vice president officers (other than the chief audit officer) within an overall budget approved by the board of directors. 
 
 Use of compensation consultant. The governance and compensation committee of the board of directors selected and engaged Aon plc (Aon) to provide assistance in evaluating the Bank s executive compensation programs for 2023. Aon reported directly to the committee and the board with respect to executive compensation. 
 
 Consideration of competitive compensation levels. The Bank s executive compensation program is designed to be appropriately competitive with prevailing practices in the broader financial services industry, consistent with the Bank s business and risk profile. As part of each compensation review process for 2023, the board considered base salary, bonus compensation, total cash compensation, long-term compensation and total direct compensation at a peer group consisting of (1) the other FHLBanks and (2) commercial banks with assets over 20 billion. In addition to the other FHLBanks, the Bank believes that the other institutions included in this peer group present a breadth and level of complexity of operations that are generally comparable to the Bank. With respect to Mr. Malmberg and Mr. Kazazian, the board also considered an additional peer group of public proxy peers with assets between 10 billion and 20 billion. Generally, it is the Bank s overall intent to provide executive officers with total direct compensation, comprised of base salary and targeted incentive opportunities, at or above the competitive market median for comparable positions, recognizing other comparable financial institutions provide equity awards that the Bank is unable to provide. However, when setting the compensation for the Bank s executives, the board did not target any named executive officer s compensation to a specific quartile of such executive officer s comparable position in the peer groups. 
 
 The Bank is exempt from SEC proxy rules and certain compensation disclosure that is required in proxy statements and accordingly does not provide member advisory say on pay votes regarding executive compensation. 
 
 Finance Agency oversight of executive compensation. Pursuant to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, the Director prohibits the FHLBanks from providing to any executive officer compensation that is not reasonable and comparable with compensation for employment in other similar businesses involving similar duties and responsibilities. FHLBanks may not transfer, disburse, or pay compensation to any executive officer, or enter into an agreement with such executive officer, without the approval of the Director. Pursuant to this authority and a Finance Agency final rule on executive compensation (12 CFR Part 1230), the FHLBanks are required to report to the Director all compensation actions relating to the president, the chief financial officer, and the three other most highly compensated officers at least 30 days in advance of any board decision with respect to those actions, and at least 60 days prior to entering into any written arrangement that provides incentive awards to any executive officer. At any time before an executive compensation action is taken, the Director may require an FHLBank to withhold any payment, transfer, or disbursement of compensation to an executive officer, or to place such compensation in an escrow account, or prohibit the action. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act also sets rules on permissible golden parachute payments and authorizes the Director to prohibit the Bank from making any such payments to its officers, employees, and directors. The Director has the power to approve, disapprove, or modify the executive compensation of the FHLBanks. 
 123 

Table of Content 

In addition, Finance Agency Advisory Bulletin 2009-AB-02 established five principles for executive compensation by the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance: 
 
 executive compensation must be reasonable and comparable to that offered to executives in similar positions at other comparable financial institutions; 
 
 executive incentive compensation should be consistent with sound risk management and preservation of the par value of the FHLBank s capital stock; 
 
 a significant percentage of an executive s incentive-based compensation should be tied to longer-term performance and outcome indicators; 
 
 a significant percentage of an executive s incentive-based compensation should be deferred and made contingent upon the FHLBank s financial performance over several years; and 
 
 the FHLBank s board of directors should promote accountability and transparency in the process of setting compensation. 
 
 The Finance Agency requires that the FHLBanks maintain a risk management program to assess and manage potential risks relating to management s performance goals, objectives, and compensation structure. The Finance Agency may prohibit or restrict a significantly undercapitalized FHLBank from taking certain actions relating to the compensation of its executives, including paying any bonus to an executive officer or increasing an executive officer s salary, without the prior written approval of the Director. The Bank was not undercapitalized during 2023. 
 
 Compensation Decisions for 2023 
 
 Overview 
 
 The board of directors bases its compensation decisions on both objective criteria related to the Bank s performance and subjective criteria related to each executive s performance. Among the various criteria the board considered in evaluating the named executive officers performance were: 
 
 achievement of performance objectives for 2023 as determined by the board; 
 
 fulfillment of the Bank s public policy mission; 
 
 demonstration of leadership and vision for the Bank; 
 
 implementation and maintenance of effective business strategies and operations, legal and regulatory compliance programs, risk management activities, and internal controls commensurate with the Bank s size, scope, and complexity; 
 
 establishment and maintenance of strong relationships between the Bank and its customers, members, employees, 
 regulators, and other stakeholders; and 
 
 the Bank s 2023 financial results. 
 
 As part of the compensation review process for compensation to be paid in 2023, the board engaged Aon in 2022 to provide competitive market compensation ranges for Mr. Malmberg, Mr. Can, Mr. O Shields, Mr. Kazazian and Ms. Hunter (Aon Study). The Aon Study involved an analysis of total compensation for comparable positions at the following 87 institutions, each a commercial bank with assets over 20 billion, as well as the other FHLBanks.

The value of retirement plans and other benefits were not specifically considered as part of the Aon study. To account for differences in the size and scope of the comparable positions included in the Aon Study, low quartile data (25th percentile), median data (50th percentile) or high quartile data (75th percentile) was selected for each of those jobs to develop a market composite comparison for each of the positions held by the applicable named executive officers. In the case of the other FHLBanks, executive to executive comparisons were made at the high quartile to account for the Bank s size and scope. In the case of the commercial bank peers, divisional head comparisons were used to identify the jobs with the closest functional responsibilities to the applicable named executive officers, and executive comparisons were made at the median data. For purposes of the Bank s comparative analysis, total direct compensation within +/- 15 percent of the median market composite compensation was considered to be within the competitive market range.

2023 Base Salary 
 
 In setting the base salaries of the named executive officers for 2023, the board took into consideration the results of the Aon Study, which showed that each of these executive s base salary and targeted incentive opportunities were at or below the lower bound of the competitive market median for his or her position when compared with commercial Banks and comparable when compared with other Federal Home Loan Banks. After reviewing the Bank s performance and the performance of each of the named executive officers during fiscal year 2022, the board set the named executive officers salaries at the following amounts for 2023: 
 
 Name 2023 Base Salary Percent Change from 2022 Kirk R. Malmberg 975,000 7.14 Haig H. Kazazian, III 480,000 9.09 Alp E. Can (1) 
 520,000 4.00 K. Annette Hunter 400,000 11.44 Reginald O'Shields 465,000 5.68 
 __________ 
 (1) Mr. Can s salary was set at 500,000 as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The board based these decisions, in part, on the following: 
 
 Business results generated during 2022; 
 
 Safe and sound operations during 2022; and 
 
 Comparable compensation provided at similar organizations, as reflected in the Aon Study

Incentive Compensation 
 
 The following table presents the 2023 award opportunities, as established by the board under the ICP, expressed as a percentage of base pay earnings during the year. 
 2023 Award Opportunities 
 Percent of Base Salary ) Title Threshold Target Maximum President and Chief Executive Officer 50.00 75.00 100.00 Executive Vice Presidents 35.00 60.00 85.00 
 
 For 2023, the board established four incentive goals under the ICP, which correlated to the member focus, financial focus, risk management performance and diversity, equity and inclusion priorities reflected in the Bank s strategic plan. Each of these goals is described in more detail below. Awards for executive vice presidents also included individual and team goals. The board of directors established threshold, target, and maximum performance levels for each quantitative incentive goal. Each goal s target performance level is consistent with the assumptions set forth in the Bank s annual operating budget, forecasts, and strategic plan. The threshold and maximum performance levels are designed to reward partial attainment of the goal and performance beyond the forecasted levels, respectively. Factors considered in setting the various performance levels include management s projections concerning economic conditions, interest rates, demand for advances products, and balance sheet structure. 
 The following tables provide the weights and awards for each performance target as a percentage of base salary that the board established for 2023. A description of each of the performance metrics, and the performance against such metrics in 2023, is provided following the table.

Table of Content 

The Member Focus - Member Engagement goal measured the average utilization of the Bank s products and services by members during 2023. Performance under this measure was determined by calculating the total product utilization by members as of December 31, 2023, referred to as activity points, over the daily average number of members for each business day of 2023. The performance goals were 2.00 (threshold), 2.20 (target) and 2.55 (maximum) activity points per member. This goal was substantially the same for each named executive officer, with the exception of Mr. Can (who did not have this performance metric), and performance was determined on an overall Bank-wide basis. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank achieved a member activity performance score of 3.107 engagement points per member. Based on 2023 performance, the board awarded the maximum level for this goal. 
 
 The Risk Management Focus - Risk Management Key Risk Indicator goal involved managing the Bank s key risks at appropriate tolerance levels. Under this measure, the board and management defined the Bank s key risks and the tolerance levels with respect to those risks. The Bank then scored each key risk based upon whether the Bank was satisfying the defined tolerance level. If the Bank was performing at or better than the defined tolerance level for all key risks, a risk appetite performance score of 100 was achieved. A deduction was applied to the risk appetite performance score for each key risk performing below the defined tolerance level. The amount that was deducted depended upon the extent of the underperformance. The performance goals were 85.0 percent risk appetite performance score (threshold), 95.0 percent risk appetite performance score (target), and 100 percent risk appetite performance score (maximum). This goal was substantially the same for each named executive officer, with the exception of Mr. Can (whose overall weighting for this goal was higher, consistent with his role as Chief Risk Officer), and performance was determined on an overall Bank-wide basis. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank achieved a risk appetite performance score of 97.76 percent. Based upon that score, the board awarded between target and maximum level for this goal. 
 
 The Financial Focus - Return on Equity Spread to Average SOFR performance goal related to the Bank s ROE amount in excess average SOFR. For ICP purposes, ROE is adjusted for additional voluntary housing contributions. This performance measure reflects the Bank s ability to pay quarterly dividends to its members and was established with a sliding scale so that the spread performance metrics become smaller as SOFR increases and remained subject to certain accounting adjustments which were not deemed necessary. For 2023, the performance goals were 60 basis points (threshold), 80 basis points (target), and 110 basis points (maximum). This goal was substantially the same for each named executive officer, with the exception of Mr. Can (who did not have this performance metric), and performance was determined on an overall Bank-wide basis. In 2023, the Bank s adjusted ROE spread to average SOFR was 262 basis points. Based upon that calculation, the board awarded the maximum level for this goal. 
 
 The Diversity, Equity and Inclusion performance goal aligned with the Bank s commitment to its diversity, equity and inclusion program and measured the Bank s ability to operate in accordance with its board approved diversity, equity and inclusion strategy. This performance goal utilized the eight quantitative goals contained in the Bank s 2023 diversity, equity and inclusion operational plan. These eight goals are in the areas of workforce, supplier, capital markets and partnership. Under this measure, the performance goals required achievement of four (threshold), five (target), or seven (maximum) of the eight quantitative goals. In 2023, eight of these goals were achieved. Based on that achievement, the board awarded the maximum level for this goal. 
 
 In 2023, the board of directors did not establish individual performance goals for Mr. Malmberg. Individual goals for Mr. Kazazian focused on leadership initiatives, Mr. O Shields focused on governance and community investment initiatives, Mr. Can focused on collateral system strategy and credit risk management, and Ms. Hunter focused on leadership initiatives and business process efficiencies. Based upon performance in 2023, Mr. Kazazian, Mr. Can, Ms. Hunter, and Mr. O Shields were awarded maximum level for these goals.

 The amount of incentive compensation earned by each of the named executive officers under the ICP, as shown in the Total Calculated Award column in the preceding table is included in the Non-Equity Incentive Compensation Plan column in the Summary Compensation Table below, along with interest earned in 2023 on Deferred Incentives. For the Bank s current named executive officers, the Deferred Incentive portion will be paid, together with positive or negative returns (equal to the Bank s return on equity for the applicable year) over three years (2025-2027) on the following schedule, subject to certain adjustment and forfeiture provisions discussed below: 
 
 Deferred Incentive Payout Schedule 
 Payment Year Payment 2025 1/3 of balance 1-year return) 2026 1/2 of balance 2-year return) 2027 Remaining balance 3-year return) 
 
 Incentive Compensation Plan Award Adjustment or Forfeiture. The named executive officers ICP awards and Deferred Incentive are subject to adjustment or forfeiture in certain events. Under the terms of the ICP, the board of directors has reserved the right to amend, modify or terminate the ICP, in whole or in part, and to increase, decrease, terminate without penalty or payment, or otherwise modify any ICP award, at any time for any reason or no reason. 
 
 The board of directors has the authority to (i) equitably adjust ICP performance measures for a particular year under the ICP to preserve the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available to the participants for any merger, consolidation, rights offering, separation, reorganization or liquidation or any other change in the capital structure of the Bank and (ii) adjust Earned Awards (as defined in the ICP) for both current and prior years if the board determines in good faith that the amounts of any Earned Awards were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or any other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria as defined in the ICP. The board may, in its sole discretion, decline to adjust the terms of any outstanding Award, as defined, if it determines that such adjustment would violate applicable law or result in adverse tax consequences to the participant or to the Bank. 
 
 If as of the time any payment of the Deferred Incentive otherwise would be due, the board of directors has made a good faith determination that the Bank has not achieved certain objective financial performance threshold measures such as retained earnings (net of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), market value of equity/par value of capital stock, regulatory capital to assets ratio, and positive annual net income, as determined at the board s discretion, the board may in its sole discretion elect to reduce or eliminate such payment of the Deferred Incentive. 
 
 No adjustments to ICP performance measures or Earned Awards were made for ICP awards, nor reductions or eliminations of payments of a Deferred Incentive were made to named executive officers in 2023. 
 
 129 

Table of Content 

 If a named executive officer s employment with the Bank terminates for any reason prior to payment of any earned incentive compensation, all remaining payments will be forfeited, subject to certain limited exceptions if the named executive officer dies, becomes disabled, or retires, with a combination of age and years of service to the Bank totaling at least 70. 
 
 Retirement Benefits 
 
 The named executive officers are eligible to participate in certain tax-qualified and non-qualified defined benefit, defined contribution, and deferred compensation plans. These plans are described in more detail below in the sections entitled Executive Compensation Pension Benefits and Deferred Compensation. 
 
 The Bank s retirement benefit plans are a vital component of the Bank s retention strategy for executive officers, particularly because many other competing organizations provide executive officers with economic benefits based on equity interests in the employer, oftentimes in addition to similar retirement benefits. The Bank is unable to offer equity-related compensation because it is a cooperative, and only member financial institutions may own its capital stock. 
 
 Perquisites and Other Benefits 
 
 All named executive officers are eligible to participate in the benefit plans that are made available to all employees of the Bank including medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage, group term life and long-term disability insurance coverage, paid vacation, and sick leave. The named executive officers generally participate in these plans on the same basis and terms as all other employees. 
 
 The Bank offers the named executive officers a limited number of perquisites, including an annual physical examination, reimbursement for guest activities at certain business functions, and financial planning services. For Mr. Malmberg, the Bank also provides an automobile allowance of up to 1,500 per month. Because perquisites generally are limited, the board does not specifically consider perquisites when reviewing total compensation for any of the named executive officers. 
 
 Employment Arrangements and Severance Benefits 
 
 Other than the specific contractual arrangements discussed below, all Bank employees are employed under an at will arrangement. Accordingly, an employee may resign employment at any time, and the Bank may terminate the employee s employment at any time for any reason, with or without cause. 
 
 The board of directors may, in its discretion, provide severance benefits to an executive officer in the event of termination of their employment. In determining whether severance compensation is appropriate, the board of directors considers both the factors underlying the termination of employment and the employment history of the executive officer. The Bank does not provide a gross up benefit on taxes incurred with respect to any severance. 
 
 Employment Agreement . The Bank entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Malmberg effective on May 28, 2021 (Employment Agreement). Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Malmberg s employment with the Bank may be terminated by the Bank with or without cause, or by Mr. Malmberg with or without good reason, as defined in the Employment Agreement. Unless earlier terminated by either party as provided therein, the Employment Agreement has an initial three-year term and will continue to extend automatically for subsequent one-year periods unless either party elects not to renew. Mr. Malmberg is entitled to participate in all incentive, savings, and retirement plans and programs available to senior executives of the Bank. The Employment Agreement also provides for certain severance benefits for Mr. Malmberg separately from those under the Change in Control Severance Plan, which are discussed below under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. This severance arrangement was an integral and necessary component of the Bank s strategy to recruit Mr. Malmberg to the president and CEO position. 
 
 Change in Control Severance Plan. Effective January 1, 2017, the Bank adopted an Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (Severance Plan). The purpose of the Severance Plan is to facilitate the hiring and retention of senior executives capable of executing the Bank s strategic priorities, to ensure their continued dedication to the Bank notwithstanding the possibility of a change in control, and to provide them with certain protection and benefits in the event of certain termination events following a defined change in control of the Bank. The board has designated Mr. Malmberg, Mr. Kazazian, Mr. Can, Ms. Hunter, and Mr. O Shields as eligible and they participate in the Severance Plan. The Severance Plan is discussed below under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.

 Retirement Benefits 
 
 Pension Benefits 
 
 The 2023 Pension Benefits table below provides information with respect to the Pentegra Plan, which is the Bank s tax-qualified pension plan (Pension Plan), and the Bank s non-qualified Defined Benefit Equalization Plan (DBEP).

Table of Content 

 Pension Plan 
 
 The pension benefits payable under the Pension Plan are based on a pre-established defined benefit formula that provides for an annual retirement allowance and a retirement death benefit. A participant s benefit in the plan vests upon completion of five years of service with the Bank, and the payout amount depends on the date of the participant s retirement, as described below. 
 
 Employees hired before July 1, 2005 
 For participants hired on or before July 1, 2005, the Pension Plan generally provides an annual retirement allowance equal to 2.50 percent of the participant s highest consecutive three-year average compensation for each year of credited service under the plan (not to exceed 30 years). Average compensation is defined as base salary and annual short-term incentive compensation. 
 
 For these participants, the standard retirement age is 65, with reduced early retirement benefits available at age 45. If the participant continues to work for the Bank until the sum of the participant s age and years of service with the Bank equals at least 70, the annual benefit payable following retirement is reduced by 1.50 percent for each year that retirement precedes normal retirement age. If the participant terminates employment before the participant s age and years of service with the Bank total 70, the annual benefit payable following retirement is reduced by six percent for each year between age 64 and 60, by four percent for each year between age 59 and 55, and by three percent for each year between age 54 and 45, in each case, that retirement precedes normal retirement age. For these participants, lump sum payments are available beginning at age 50. 
 
 Mr. Kazazian, Mr. Can, Mr. O Shields and Ms. Hunter participate in the Pension Plan on these terms because they were hired before July 1, 2005. Each of them has attained eligibility for immediate early retirement. Mr. Malmberg also participates in the Pension Plan on these terms and at a level consistent with his original date of hire. (Mr. Malmberg received a distribution from the Pension Plan following his retirement in 2020; but he re-entered the Pension Plan when he was appointed CEO in 2021.) 
 
 Employees hired between July 1, 2005, and February 28, 2011 
 
 For participants hired between July 1, 2005, and February 28, 2011, the Pension Plan generally provides an annual retirement allowance equal to 1.50 percent of the participant s highest consecutive five-year average compensation for each year of credited service under the plan (not to exceed 30 years). Average compensation is defined as base salary only. For these participants, the standard retirement age is 65, with reduced early retirement benefits available at age 55. If the participant terminates employment before reaching age 65, the annual benefit payable following retirement is reduced by six percent for each year between age 65 and 60, and by four percent for each year between age 60 and 55, in each case, that retirement precedes normal retirement age. These payments are not available for the named executive officers. 
 
 Employees hired on or after March 1, 2011 
 
 The Pension Plan was closed to new participants effective March 1, 2011. 
 
 DBEP 
 
 Payments under the Pension Plan may be limited due to federal tax code limitations. The DBEP exists to restore those benefits that executives otherwise would forfeit due to these limitations. The DBEP operates using the same benefit formula and retirement eligibility provisions as described above under the Pension Plan. Because the DBEP is a non-qualified plan, the benefits received from this plan do not receive the same tax treatment and funding protection as the Pension Plan. Mr. Kazazian, Mr. O Shields and Ms. Hunter participate in the DBEP. (Mr. Malmberg did not re-enter participation in the DBEP upon his appointment as CEO in 2021.) 
 
 Death Benefits 
 
 Death benefits, which do not vary based on date of hire, also are available under the Pension Plan and the DBEP. If an employee dies while in active service, their beneficiary is entitled to a lump sum amount equal to the commuted value of 120 monthly retirement payments. If a former employee dies while in retirement, having elected the normal form of retirement benefits, their beneficiary also is entitled to a lump sum amount equal to the commuted value of 120 monthly retirement payments less payments received before the former employee died.

 ____________ 
 (1) The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit is the present value of the annual pension benefit that was earned as of December 31, 2023, assuming retirement at age 65. Benefits under the Pension Plan were calculated using a 4.83 percent discount rate; a 4.75 percent discount rate was used to calculate benefits under the DBEP. 
 (2) Mr. Malmberg did not re-enter participation in the DBEP upon his appointment as CEO in 2021. 
 
 Deferred Compensation 
 
 Each named executive officer of the Bank is eligible to participate in the Bank s non-qualified, elective deferred compensation plan (DCP). Additionally, each named executive officer is also eligible to participate in the Bank s consolidated non-qualified Benefit Equalization Plan (BEP). The BEP includes both a defined benefit component (DBEP) described above, and defined contribution component (DCBEP) described below. Directors are eligible to participate in the DCP but are not eligible to participate in the BEP. 
 
 The DCP permits a participant to defer all or a portion of their compensation, including base salary and awards under the ICP, and to select the method of determining the earnings on such deferred compensation, based on a range of mutual fund options designed to mirror the Bank s 401(k) Plan. DCP participants also may select an interest crediting rate based on the Bank s return on equity. Distributions from the DCP may be made either in a specific year, whether or not a participant s employment has ended, or at a time that begins at or after the participant s retirement or separation. Participants may elect to receive either a lump sum distribution or annual installment payments over periods ranging from two to five years. The Bank does not match contributions to the DCP. 
 
 Named executive officers are permitted to defer up to 40.0 percent of salary under the Bank s 401(k) Plan and the DCBEP. The Bank matches the amount contributed by a participant up to six percent of base salary. 
 
 The DCBEP, like the 401(k) Plan, is self-directed and provides participants with a range of mutual fund options through the Vanguard Group. Participants earn a market rate of return based on the mutual funds selected. Distributions from the DCBEP begin when a participant s employment has ended. Participants may elect to receive either a lump sum distribution or annual installment payments over periods ranging from two to five years. These plans are designed to encourage additional voluntary savings and to offer a valuable financial planning tool. All Bank contributions to the DCBEP are subject to a two-year vesting period. 
 
 The board amended the BEP, effective January 1, 2018, to: 
 
 provide that any executive hired or promoted to the level of senior vice president or higher after January 1, 2018 eligible executives ), will not be eligible to receive the defined benefit feature of the BEP; 
 
 provide senior vice presidents hired or promoted after January 1, 2018 with a contribution equivalent to 10.0 percent of base pay offset by contributions to the 401(k) Plan; and 
 
 135 

Table of Content 

 provide senior vice presidents hired or promoted after January 1, 2018 with a contribution equivalent to 10.0 percent of incentive compensation. 
 
 The board amended the BEP, effective April 1, 2021, to: 
 
 define a new category of executives as eligible participants: those who were hired or promoted to chief executive officer on or after April 1, 2021 and regardless of participation in the Bank s qualified pension plan but who are not eligible to accrue benefits under the Bank's non-qualified defined benefit equalization plan; 
 
 provide eligible executives with a contribution equivalent to 20 percent of base pay offset by contributions to the 401(k) Plan; and 
 
 provide eligible executives with a contribution equivalent to 20.0 percent of any bonuses paid in the current year. 
 
 The board further amended the BEP, effective July 2, 2022 to: 
 
 define a new category of executives as eligible participants: those who occupy the chief risk officer role as of July 1, 2022 and regardless of participation in the Bank s qualified pension plan but who are not eligible to accrue benefits under the Bank's non-qualified defined benefit equalization plan; 
 
 provide eligible executives with a contribution equivalent to 20.0 percent of base pay offset by contributions to the 401(k) Plan; and 
 
 provide eligible executives with a contribution equivalent to 20.0 percent of any bonuses paid in the current year. 
 
 As of February 1, 2023, the BEP has been amended and restated to streamline administration of the plan and the eligibility for participation in the DCBEP, the DBEP, and other benefits applicable to the DCBEP. The amended and restated BEP has not changed the benefits awarded to the named executive officers nor the eligibility criteria applying to them. 
 
 The following table presents compensation earned and deferred in 2023, and earnings on, or distributions of, such amounts. In accordance with SEC rules, the amounts shown in the table do not include any amounts in respect of the 401(k) Plan.

 Change in Control Severance Plan 
 Effective January 1, 2017, the Bank adopted an Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (Severance Plan). 
 Overview of the Severance Plan 
 The Severance Plan provides certain protection and benefits in the event of a Qualifying Termination (as defined below) following a Change in Control (as defined below). The Severance Plan applies to employees or officers who are designated by the Bank s board of directors as participants. The Bank s board has designated Mr. Malmberg, Mr. Kazazian, Mr. Can, Mr. O Shields and Ms. Hunter as participants in the Severance Plan.

 Qualifying Termination means any separation, termination or other discontinuation of the employment relationship between the Bank and a participant, (A) by the Bank, other than for cause (as defined in the Severance Plan); or (B) by the participant, for good reason (as defined in the Severance Plan), but does not include a termination resulting from the participant s death or disability. 
 138 

Table of Content 

The Severance Plan defines cause to include: 
 
 the participant s failure to perform substantially their duties; 
 
 the participant s engagement in illegal conduct or willful misconduct injurious to the Bank; 
 
 the participant s material violation of law or regulation or of the Bank s written policies or guidelines;

 a material diminution in the participant s base salary or in their duties or authority; 
 
 the Bank requiring the participant to be based at any office or location other than in Atlanta, Georgia; or 
 
 a material breach of the Severance Plan by the Bank. 
 
 Under the terms of the Severance Plan, if there is a Qualifying Termination during the period beginning on the earliest of the date a definitive agreement or order for a Change in Control has been entered, or the effective date of a Change of Control as prescribed by the Finance Agency, and ending, in all cases, twenty-four (24) months following the effective date of the Change in Control, the participant becomes entitled to certain severance payments and benefits. 
 These payments and benefits include the following: 
 The CEO would receive a cash payment equal to 2.5 times their annual base salary amount. 
 
 An executive vice president would receive a cash payment equal to 1.75 times their annual base salary amount. 
 
 Participants would receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the amount that would have been payable pursuant to the participant s incentive compensation award for the year in which the date of a Qualifying Termination occurs, prorated based on the number of days the participant was employed that year. 
 
 Participants would receive a lump sum cash payment for outplacement assistance in the amount of 7,500. 
 
 In addition, the CEO would receive a cash payment equivalent to 24 months of health continuation coverage, and executive vice presidents would receive a cash payment equivalent to 18 months of health continuation coverage.

 the Bank s liquidation or dissolution. 
 
 The payments described above are payable in a lump sum within sixty (60) days following the participant s employment termination date, except the prorated incentive compensation award, which is payable at the time such incentive compensation awards are paid to other senior executives. All payments and benefits are conditioned on the executive having delivered an irrevocable general release of claims against the Bank before payment occurs. In addition, all payments and benefits remain subject to the Bank s compliance with any applicable statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the payment of amounts under the Severance Plan. The Severance Plan requires that an individual execute a participation agreement to become a participant in the Severance Plan. Each Mr. Malmberg, Mr. Kazazian, Mr. Can, Mr. O Shields, and Ms. Hunter have executed a participation agreement to become participants in the Severance Plan. 
 
 The following table presents information about potential payments under the Severance Plan in the event that a Change in Control had occurred and their employment had terminated due to a Qualifying Termination on December 31, 2023. None of the participants would be entitled to any gross-up payments on taxes incurred with respect to any severance, whether under Section 280G of the tax code or otherwise.

 CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure Rule 
 The following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Bank s president and CEO, Mr. Malmberg, to the median of the annual total compensation of the Bank s other employees. The Bank identified the median employee in 2022 by examining the 2022 base pay for all 317 individuals, excluding the CEO, who were employed by the Bank on December 1, 2022 (annualized for any permanent full- or part-time employees that were not employed by the Bank for all of 2022). For 2023, the Bank determined to use the same median employee in its pay ratio calculation because there has not been a change in the Bank s population or employee compensation arrangements that it believes would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. The Bank calculated the annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology the Bank uses for its named executive officers as set forth in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table included earlier in this Executive Compensation section of the Report. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Bank s median employee total annual compensation was 208,890, the CEO s total annual compensation was 2,664,499; and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation was 12.76 to 1. 
 Under the SEC s rules and guidance, there are numerous ways to determine the median employee for purposes of calculating the pay ratio, and companies may differ in the methods they use, including the employee population sampled, the elements of pay and benefits used, any assumptions made and the use of statistical sampling. In addition, no two companies have identical employee populations or compensation programs, and pay, benefits and retirement plans differ by country even within the same company. As such, the Bank s pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.

 Director Compensation 
 The FHLBank Act provides that each FHLBank may pay its directors reasonable compensation for the time required of them, and their necessary expenses, in the performance of their duties, subject to approval by the Director. In accordance with the FHLBank Act, the Bank has adopted a policy governing the compensation and travel expense reimbursement provided to its directors. Under this policy, directors receive fees paid for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors and meeting of a committee of the board of directors, as further described below. These fees are subject to the annual caps established under the policy. Directors do not receive separate retainers. 
 Directors are reimbursed for reasonable Bank-related travel expenses in accordance with Bank policy. 
 During 2023, directors received fees for attendance at each board and committee meeting as described below. The following table presents the annual compensation limits applied. 
 2023 Annual Director Compensation Limits 
 Title Amount Chair of the Board 150,000 Vice Chair of the Board 135,000 Chair of the Audit Committee 130,000 Other Committee Chair (excluding Audit and Executive) 125,000 All Other Directors 115,000 
 
 Under the 2023 Directors Compensation Policy, each director had an opportunity to receive a payment of approximately one-seventh of that director s annual cap for attendance at no less than 75.0 percent of the board meeting and meetings of each committee of the board on which the director serves during each interim period. The first interim period began on December 12, 2022 and ended January 26, 2023 (the last day of the first scheduled in-person board meeting for 2023). Each successive interim period began on the calendar day immediately following a scheduled board meeting through and including the day of the next scheduled board meeting, with the seventh interim period ending on December 10, 2023 after the seventh scheduled in-person board meeting. Under the policy, after the end of the seventh interim period and before the seventh payment was made, the governance and compensation committee of the board reviews the cumulative attendance and performance of each director during the year and, in consultation with the chair of the board, may recommended to the board a reduction, elimination or increase in the final payment opportunity for each director, provided that no increase may exceed the applicable annual compensation cap. No such adjustment was made for 2023.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 
 
 The Bank is a cooperative whose members own substantially all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank and elect the directors of the Bank. The voting right of members is generally limited to the election of the Bank s board of directors. A member is eligible to vote for the number of open member director seats in the state in which its principal place of business is located, and all members are eligible to vote for the number of open independent director seats. Membership is voluntary, and a member must give notice of its intent to withdraw from membership. A member that withdraws from membership may not acquire shares of any FHLBank before the end of the five-year period beginning on the date of the completion of its divestiture of Bank stock. 
 
 The Bank does not offer any compensation plan under which equity securities of the Bank are authorized for issuance. The following table presents the ownership of the Bank s capital stock, which is concentrated within the financial services industry and is stratified across various institution types (in millions).

 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 
 
 Because the Bank is a cooperative, capital stock ownership is a prerequisite for a member to transact any business with the Bank. The Bank s member directors are officers or directors of member institutions. All directors and any member that holds five percent or more of the Bank s voting securities are classified as related parties under SEC regulations. In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank may transact business with each of the members that has an officer or director serving as a director of the Bank and members that hold five percent or more of the Bank s voting securities. All such transactions: 
 
 have been made in the ordinary course of the Bank s business; 
 have been made subject to the same Bank policies as transactions with the Bank s members generally; and 
 in the opinion of management, do not involve more than the normal risk of collection or present other unfavorable features. 
 
 The Bank has adopted a written related person transaction policy, which requires the Governance and Compensation Committee of the board of directors to review and, if appropriate, to approve certain transactions between the Bank and any related person (as defined by applicable SEC regulations). Pursuant to the policy, the committee will review any transaction the Bank would be required to disclose in filings with the SEC in which the Bank is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds 120,000, and in which any related person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The Bank has exemptive relief, pursuant to an SEC no-action letter and by law, from disclosing related person transactions that arise in the ordinary course of the Bank s business. The committee may approve those transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Bank and its shareholders. 
 
 In addition, the Bank has a written Code of Conduct applicable to all employees and a Code of Conduct and Ethics for Directors as well as other written policies and procedures that also may apply to or prohibit certain related person transactions.

These assessments, which totaled 78,067 and 67,785 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, are not included in the table above. 
 
 The Bank is exempt from ordinary federal, state, and local taxation, except employment and real property taxes. No tax-related fees were paid to PwC during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
 
 The Audit Committee of the board of directors has adopted the Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy (Pre-Approval Policy). In accordance with the Pre-Approval Policy and applicable law, the Audit Committee pre-approves audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and non-audit services to be provided by the Bank s independent registered public accounting firm. The term of any pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval unless the Audit Committee specifically provides otherwise. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee reviews the list of specific services and projected fees for services to be provided for the next 12 months and pre-approves services as the Audit Committee deems necessary. Under the Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit Committee has granted pre-approval authority to the chair and the vice chair of the Audit Committee, subject to limitation as set forth in the Pre-Approval Policy. The chair or the vice chair must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. New services that have not been pre-approved by the Audit Committee that are in excess of the pre-approval fee level established by the Audit Committee must be presented to the entire Audit Committee for pre-approval. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 100 percent of the audit fees, audit-related fees, and all other fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

 DESCRIPTION OF THE BANKS CAPITAL STOCK

Document 

Exhibit 4.2 
 Description of the Bank s Capital Stock 
 
 The Bank s capital structure consists solely of Class B stock, par value 100 per share. The Class B stock contains three distinct subclasses, each of which is issued, redeemed, and repurchased at par value. Under the Bank s Capital Plan, each member is required to maintain a certain minimum investment in Class B stock of the Bank. Each member s minimum stock requirement is equal to the sum of a membership stock component and an activity-based stock component. Shares of Subclass B1 Class B stock are issued to meet the membership stock requirement and shares of Subclass B2 Class B stock and Subclass B3 Class B stock are issued to meet the activity-based stock requirement. 
 
 Subclass B1 Class B Stock 
 
 Each member is required to maintain a minimum investment in Subclass B1 shares sufficient to meet its membership stock requirement as long as the institution remains a member of the Bank. 
 
 From time to time the Bank s board of directors may adjust the membership stock requirement, including the cap, within specified ranges set forth in the Capital Plan. Under the Capital Plan, the membership stock requirement can range from 0.01 percent (one basis points) to 0.40 percent (40 basis points) of the member s total assets and the cap can range from 1 million to 35 million. Any adjustment by the board of directors outside these ranges would require an amendment to the Capital Plan and Finance Agency approval. Each member is required to comply with any adjustment to the membership stock requirement on its effective date. A member may not use shares of Subclass B2 Class B stock or Subclass B3 Class B stock to meet its membership stock requirement. 
 
 As of the date of this report, a member s membership stock requirement is 0.07 percent (7 basis points) of the member s total assets, subject to a cap of 18 million. 
 
 Subclass B2 Class B Stock and Subclass B3 Class B Stock 
 
 Each member is required to maintain a minimum investment in Subclass B2 shares and Subclass B3 shares sufficient to meet its activity-based stock requirement as long as the related assets continue to be carried on the Bank s balance sheet. 
 
 From time to time, the board of directors may adjust the activity-based stock requirement within specified ranges set forth in the Capital Plan as follows 
 
 The advances stock requirement, which shall equal an amount of Subclass B2 Capital Stock not less than 2.00 percent nor greater than 6.00 percent of the member s outstanding advances 
 
 The acquired member assets stock requirement, which shall equal an amount of Subclass B2 Capital Stock not less than 0.00 percent nor greater than 6.00 percent of any acquired member asset sold by the member and owned by the Bank 
 
 The targeted debt equity investments stock requirement, which shall equal an amount of Subclass B2 Capital Stock not less than 6.00 percent nor greater than 9.00 percent of any targeted debt equity investment sold by the member and owned by the Bank, and 

1 of 6 

The standby letters of credit requirement, which shall equal an amount of Subclass B3 Capital Stock not less than 0.10 percent nor greater than 2.00 percent of the amount of standby letters of credit issued by the Bank on behalf of the member. 
 
 Any adjustment outside the ranges would require an amendment to the Capital Plan and Finance Agency approval. Each member is required to comply promptly with any adjustment to the activity-based stock requirement. A member may not use shares of Subclass B1 Class B stock to meet its activity-based stock requirement. 
 
 As of the date of this report, a member s activity-based stock requirement is the sum of the following items 
 
 4.75 percent of the member s outstanding par value of advances 
 
 8.00 percent of any outstanding targeted debt equity investment (such as multifamily residential mortgage loan assets) sold by the member to the Bank on or after December 17, 2004 and 
 
 0.10 percent of members outstanding standby letters of credit. 
 
 The activity-based stock requirement also may include a percentage of any outstanding balance of acquired member assets (such as residential mortgage loan assets), which was set at zero as of the date of this report. 
 
 Dividend Rights 
 
 The Bank s board of directors, in its sole discretion, may declare and direct the Bank to pay dividends on the Class B stock. All outstanding shares of Class B stock participate in any dividend without preference and without distinction between subclasses. Dividends may be paid in the form of cash or capital stock and will be computed based on the amount of time during the relevant quarter or other period that the Class B stock was outstanding. A former member of the Bank is entitled to receive any dividends attributable to its Class B stock through the date of redemption or repurchase of that stock by the Bank. 
 
 Dividend distributions may be limited or prohibited in some circumstances under regulatory requirements, Bank Policy, the Capital Plan or other commitments made by the Bank. 
 
 Dividends may be paid only from the Bank s current net earnings or retained earnings. The board of directors may not declare a dividend under any one or more of the following circumstances 
 
 If the Bank s capital position is below its minimum regulatory capital requirement 
 
 If the Bank s capital position will be below its minimum regulatory capital requirement after paying the dividend 
 
 If the principal or interest due on any consolidated obligation issued through the Office of Finance has not been paid in full or 
 
 If the Bank becomes a noncomplying FHLBank under Finance Agency regulations as a result of its inability to comply with regulatory liquidity requirements or satisfy its current obligations. 

2 of 6 

The Bank has adopted a retained earnings target. In addition, pursuant to the Amended Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement by and among each of the FHLBanks and the respective Bank s Capital Plan provisions related to retained earnings enhancements, the Bank is required to contribute a percentage of its net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account. 
 
 Repurchase and Redemption Provisions 
 
 Excess Stock Repurchases Initiated by the Bank 
 
 A member may hold Class B stock in excess of its minimum stock requirement, called excess stock, to the extent it has the legal authority under applicable statutes and regulations, subject to the following provisions. The excess stock threshold amount for repurchases is currently set at 100,000. 
 
 Repurchases of Membership Stock Subclass B1 Class B stock 
 
 The Bank will recalculate the membership stock requirement of each member at least annually, and no later than March 31 of each year, using financial data as of the prior calendar year-end. In its discretion, the Bank may recalculate any member s membership stock requirement more frequently, using the most recently available financial data. The Bank also will recalculate each member s membership stock requirement on the effective date of any adjustment to the percentage used in calculating this membership stock requirement. If any of these recalculations results in a decrease in the member s membership stock requirement, the Bank, in its sole discretion, may, but is not required to, repurchase any excess shares of Subclass B1 Class B stock held by the member. Upon termination of membership, any Subclass B1 Class B stock that is not required to meet the former member s membership stock retention requirement is excess stock subject to repurchase by the Bank, in its sole discretion. 
 
 Repurchases of Activity-Based Stock Subclass B2 Class B stock and Subclass B3 Class B stock 
 
 The Bank will recalculate each member s activity-based stock requirement at the time of any change in the amount of transactions outstanding between the Bank and the member, which can occur daily, and on the effective date of any adjustment to the percentages used in calculating the activity-based stock requirement. If this recalculation results in a decrease to the member s activity-based stock requirement, and the par value of excess shares of Subclass B2 Class B stock and or Subclass B3 Class stock held by a member exceeds the excess stock threshold amount, the Bank generally will, in its discretion, repurchase some or all of the excess shares of Subclass B2 Class B stock and or Subclass B3 Class stock held by that member. For example, the Bank may stagger the purchase of excess shares for capital management purposes. The Bank may change this repurchase policy upon notice to the members. 
 
 Excess Stock Redemptions Initiated by Members 
 
 Under the Bank s Capital Plan, a member may request redemption of its excess stock, payable in cash at par value, upon five years prior written notice to the Bank. The Bank may, in its sole discretion and at any time, repurchase shares of excess stock referenced in the member s written notice of redemption. 
 
 The written notice must indicate the particular subclass(es) and number of shares to be redeemed. The five-year redemption period starts when the Bank receives written notice from the member. A member may not have more than one written notice of redemption outstanding at any one time for the same shares of Class B stock. Following the requested redemption, the member must continue to meet its minimum stock requirement under the Capital Plan. 
 
 3 of 6 

The member may cancel its redemption request before the end of the five-year redemption period by providing a written cancellation notice to the Bank, subject to a redemption cancellation fee. 
 
 If, at the end of the five-year redemption period, the member would fail to meet its minimum stock requirement, the Bank will not redeem the member s Class B stock but will attempt the redemption on each of the following five business days following the expiration of the redemption period. If the Bank is prevented from redeeming a member s Class B stock during this period for this reason, the redemption notice will be cancelled automatically and the member will be required to pay a redemption cancellation fee. 
 
 If the member meets the redemption requirements at the expiration of the five-year redemption period, the Bank will pay to the member in cash the par value of all shares requested to be redeemed, subject to the limitations on redemption discussed below. 
 
 Repurchases and Redemptions upon Termination of Membership 
 
 If a member s membership is terminated, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or through merger or relocation, the Class B stock generally will be subject to a five-year redemption period. 
 
 Limitations on Redemptions and Repurchases 
 
 The Bank s authority to redeem or repurchase Class B stock is subject to a number of limitations. Specifically, the Bank will not redeem or repurchase Class B stock if, following the redemption or repurchase, the Bank would fail to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirement or the affected member would fail to meet its minimum stock requirement. Also, the Bank may not redeem or repurchase any Class B stock without the prior written approval of the Finance Agency, if the Finance Agency or the Bank s board of directors has determined that the Bank has incurred, or is likely to incur, losses that result in, or are likely to result in, charges against capital creating an other-than-temporary decline in the Bank s total capital that causes the value of the Bank s total capital to fall below the Bank s aggregate amount of Class B stock. This prohibition will apply even if the Bank is in compliance with its capital requirements and will remain in effect for however long the Bank continues to incur such charges or until the Finance Agency determines that such charges are not expected to continue. 
 
 The Bank s board of directors, or a committee thereof, may temporarily suspend redemptions and repurchases of Class B stock if it reasonably believes that such continued redemption or repurchase of Class B stock would result in one of the following 
 
 Cause the Bank to fail to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirement 
 
 Prevent the Bank from maintaining adequate capital against a potential risk that may not be adequately reflected in its minimum regulatory capital requirement or 
 
 Otherwise prevent the Bank from operating in a safe and sound manner. 
 
 The Bank must notify the Finance Agency of any determination to suspend redemptions. The Bank will not repurchase any Class B stock without prior written approval of the Finance Agency during the period that redemptions are suspended under this provision. 
 
 The Bank may not redeem or repurchase shares of Class B stock from any member if the principal and interest due on any consolidated obligation issued through the Office of Finance has not been paid in full, or, under certain circumstances, if the Bank becomes a non-complying FHLBank under 
 
 4 of 6 

Finance Agency regulations as a result of its inability to comply with regulatory liquidity requirements or to satisfy its current obligations. 
 
 In addition, on any day that the sum of all repurchases of excess stock equals or exceeds an amount that would cause the Bank to fall below its minimum regulatory capital requirements, the Bank will suspend repurchase activities until either it can honor those repurchases in full or the board of directors establishes pro rata repurchase procedures. 
 
 Pursuant to Amended Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement by and among each of the FHLBanks and the respective Bank s Capital Plan provisions related to retained earnings enhancements, the Bank is required to hold an amount of restricted retained earnings. Redemptions and repurchases of Class B stock are prohibited in the event the Bank s total capital, defined as retained earnings, the amount paid-in for capital stock, the amount of any general allowance for losses, and the amount of other instruments that the Finance Agency has determined to be available to absorb losses incurred by the Bank, falls below the Bank s aggregate paid-in amount of capital stock. 
 
 Voting Rights 
 
 The members are entitled to vote only in connection with the election of directors in accordance with the FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations. Voting rights in regard to the election of directors are set forth at 12 C.F.R. Section 1261. The Bank calculates annually each member s minimum stock requirement for purposes of determining its voting shares based on the member s total assets, outstanding activity, acquired member assets, and targeted debt equity investments carried on the Bank s balance sheet on the preceding December 31, which is the record date for such determination. Each member is eligible to vote for all open elective director seats in the state in which its principal place of business is located. Each member is entitled to cast one vote for each share of Class B stock that the member was required to hold as of the record date in each election for each open elective director seat in the state in which the member s principal place of business is located. In cases in which there are multiple directorships to be filled for a voting state, a member may not aggregate all of its available votes for a single candidate. In a single directorship election, a member may not split its votes between director candidates but must cast all of its votes available election for a single candidate. The number of votes that each member may cast for each directorship may not exceed the average number of shares of Class B stock required to be held as of the record date by all members located in that state. For example, if a member holds 100 shares of Class B stock, but the average number of shares of Class B stock held by all members in such member s state of residence is 75 shares, the member may vote only 75 shares in each open elective director seat election in the state in which its principal place of business is located. Excess stock is not required stock and thus is not counted in determining the number of votes that a member may cast. A former member that was a member as of the record date is entitled to vote in the election of directors in accordance with the FHLBank Act and regulations. There are no voting preferences associated with any class or subclass of Class B stock. 
 
 Classification of Board of Directors Cumulative Voting 
 
 Each member of the Bank s board of directors serves a four-year term, and the Board s terms are staggered. There are no classes of directors, and there is no cumulative voting. 
 
 Liquidation Rights 
 
 Subject to the authority of the Finance Agency, in the event of liquidation of the Bank, after making provision for the payment of the Bank s liabilities, the Bank will pay each member the par value of its Class B stock. However, if sufficient funds are not available to make payment for all of the Class B stock outstanding, payment will occur on a pro rata basis among the holders of Class B stock in proportion to the number of shares of Class B stock owned by each. In addition, upon liquidation, 
 
 5 of 6 

any undistributed retained earnings, paid-in surplus, undivided profits, equity reserves, and other assets not otherwise identified will be allocated in the same manner. In the event that the Bank merges with or consolidates into another FHLBank, the holders of Class B stock are entitled to the rights and benefits set forth in the agreement of merger or consolidation approved by the board of directors and the Finance Agency. None of the shares of Class B stock has any right of preference in liquidation. 
 
 Preemptive Rights 
 
 Members are not entitled to any preemptive rights. 
 
 Restrictions on Transfer 
 
 The Capital Plan prohibits transfers of Class B stock between members or any other parties except in connection with a merger or consolidation with another institution. Any such transfer will be at par value. 
 
 Amendment to the Capital Plan 
 
 Both the Bank s board of directors and the Finance Agency must approve any amendment to the Capital Plan. Members consent is not required to amend the Capital Plan. The Bank will provide written notice to members at least five business days prior to the effective date of any amendment.

 Authority to Approve and Amend 
 Board of Directors 
 Next Review Date 
 December 2024 
 Department Policy Owner 
 Corporate Secretary 

This policy is designed to set forth expectations for attendance by members of the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (Bank) at meetings of the board (including eight scheduled board meetings in 2024) and board committees and to ensure that each director is reasonably compensated for the time required of him or her in the performance of official Bank business. 
 
 A. Director Compensation 
 
 1. Effective January 1, 2024, the following annual compensation limits shall apply 
 
 a) Chair of the Board 155,000 
 b) Vice Chair of the Board 140,000 
 c) Chair of the Audit Committee 135,000 
 d) Other Committees Chairs (excluding Audit and Executive) 130,000 
 e) All Other Directors 123,000 
 
 2. Each director shall have the opportunity to be paid an amount equal to approximately one- seventh of such director s annual limit for actual attendance at each scheduled in-person board meeting and board committee meetings, as further described in Section B. The seventh payment opportunity shall be subject to adjustment as further described in Section 
 C. If a director serves in multiple roles, the director will have the opportunity to be paid up to the annual compensation limit for the highest compensated position held by the director. For example, if the Vice Chair of the board also serves as a committee chair, the Vice Chair s compensation limit would be 140,000. 
 
 3. In determining the above director compensation levels, the board considered a comparative compensation study prepared by a third party with expertise in compensation matters, the compensation of directors of other Federal Home Loan Banks in 2023, including median compensation, and the provision for payment of certain expenses described in Section D. The board established the above director compensation levels after evaluating the foregoing 
 1 of 4 

data and considering the time that directors are expected to devote to Bank business and the need to ensure the Bank s future ability to attract qualified directors. The compensation levels reflect the board s assessment of appropriate and comparable pay that will allow the Bank to recruit and retain highly qualified directors and compensate them for the time required in performing their duties. 
 
 B. Attendance 
 
 1. Each director is strongly encouraged to attend all meetings of the board and board committees on which the director serves and is expected to attend no less than 75 percent of all such meetings each year. 
 
 2. The Bank will pay a fee only for a director s actual attendance at no less than 75 percent of the board meetings (including scheduled board meetings, new director orientation, joint meetings of the Affordable Housing Advisory Council and board or committee, board strategy sessions, and board meetings held remotely) and meetings of each committee of the board (including any ad hoc committee established by the board for a specific purpose) on which the director serves during each interim period, as identified below. In the event two or more committees on which a director serves are scheduled to meet concurrently, only one committee meeting will be required for the purpose of calculating the director s attendance. Interested directors are not required to attend board or committee meetings that are devoted exclusively to director election matters. As ex officio members of all committees, the Chair and Vice Chair of the board are encouraged, but not required, to attend committee meetings held remotely and unscheduled committee meetings (meetings added after the 2024 board and committee meeting schedule is approved by the board). 
 
 3. The first interim period shall begin on December 11, 2023 and end on the last day of the first scheduled in-person board meeting for 2024. Each successive interim period shall begin on the calendar day immediately following a scheduled board meeting through and including the day of the next scheduled board meeting, with the seventh interim period ending on December 15, 2024 after the seventh scheduled in-person board meeting, as follows 
 
 Interim Period 
 Start Date 
 End Date 
 First December 11, 2023 
 January 25, 2024 
 Second January 26, 2024

 Third April 26, 2024 
 May 24, 2024 
 Fourth May 25, 2024

 Sixth September 22, 2024 
 October 24, 2024 
 Seventh October 25, 2024 
 December 15, 2024 

The foregoing start and end dates will be adjusted to correspond to any changes in the board meeting schedule. 
 
 4. Remote participation for in-person meetings is discouraged unless necessary to attain a quorum or the Chair determines that circumstances warrant such manner of participation. 
 
 2 of 4 

The Bank will not pay a separate fee for a director s attendance at meetings other than those described above. 
 5. The Bank will not advance the payment of fees to any director. 
 
 C. Performance 
 
 1. Compensation paid to directors must reflect the time required of them in the performance of official Bank business. The time required will be measured principally by attendance and participation at board and board committee meetings, as described above, and secondarily by performance of other duties. These other duties include time spent (a) preparing for board meetings (b) chairing meetings as appropriate (c) reviewing materials sent to directors on a periodic basis (d) attending other related events such as management conferences, FHLBank System meetings, and director training and (e) fulfilling the responsibilities of directors. 
 
 2. Before the seventh payment is made, the Governance and Compensation Committee (GCC) shall review the cumulative attendance and performance of each director during 2024 and, in consultation with the Chair, recommend to the board a reduction, elimination or increase in the final payment opportunity. No increase shall exceed the applicable compensation limit. In the event a director serves on the board for only a portion of a calendar year, the final payment for such director shall be subject to the same cumulative attendance and performance review through the director s final date of service. 
 D. Expenses 
 1. In accordance with the Bank s normal reimbursement policy, the Bank will reimburse a director s travel expenses and any registration fees incurred in connection with attendance at any board or board committee meeting, the Council of FHLBanks directors conference, Chicago risk governance audit forum, any seminar or event specifically identified in the director education plan, any meeting or event that Bank management invites a director to attend in order to engage with members or otherwise to represent the Bank s interests, and provided the director is the Bank s designated representative, meetings of the FHLBank Chairs Vice Chairs and Council of FHLBanks board of representatives. Please consult the Bank s Travel and Entertainment Policy for a more detailed explanation regarding expense reimbursement. 
 2. The Bank will reimburse a director s registration fees and travel expenses incurred in connection with any other meeting, hearing, ceremony, continuing education seminar, or other event only if the Chair determines that the meeting is relevant to the Bank s business activities or the director s duties as a board member and the director attends the meeting at the request of, or with the approval of, the Chair. The Vice Chair shall approve all such fees and expenses for the Chair. These amounts will be reimbursable to the extent provided for such purpose in the Bank s annual budget and in accordance with the Bank s Travel and Entertainment Policy. The Bank will not pay a fee for a director s participation in these types of activities, and in accordance with 12 C.F.R. Part 1261, the Bank will not reimburse directors for entertainment expenses at these events. 
 3 of 4 

3. The Bank may provide directors other limited benefits and limited travel perquisites as specified in advance by the Bank. 
 
 4. Amounts paid by the Bank for any of the foregoing director expenses will be reported as compensation to the director to the extent of and in compliance with applicable Internal Revenue Service laws and regulations and such expenses are in addition to the compensation limits identified in Section A above. Therefore, a director s total annual compensation limit shall consist of (1) annual compensation set forth in Section A above and (2) payment for other items set forth in Section D..

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

Document 

Exhibit 99.1 

Audit Committee Report 
 March 8, 2024 
 The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee Charter is available on the Who W e Are - Investor Relations - Governance section of the Bank s Internet website at http corp.fhlbatl.com who-we-are investor-relations . 
 The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee management s implementation of the Bank's financial reporting process and the audits of the Bank s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Bank s management is responsible for preparing the Bank's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and applicable laws and regulations, establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting, and evaluating the effectiveness of such internal controls over financial reporting. The Bank s independent registered public accounting firm (independent auditor) is responsible for auditing the Bank's financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the financial statements with such standards. The Bank s independent auditor is also responsible for auditing the Bank s internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with such standards and for expressing an opinion on the Bank s internal controls over financial reporting. 
 The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee management's implementation of the Bank s financial reporting process and the audits of the Bank s financial statements and its internal controls over financial reporting. In this regard, the Audit Committee meets periodically with management and the Bank s internal auditor and independent auditor. The Audit Committee discusses with the Bank s internal auditor and the independent auditor the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the Bank s internal auditor and the independent auditor, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Bank's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Bank's financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews significant audit findings, if any, together with management's responses thereto. 
 The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Bank s independent auditor. As part of fulfilling this responsibility, the Audit Committee engages in an 

annual evaluation of, among other things, the independent auditor s qualifications, competence, integrity, expertise, performance, independence and communications with the Audit Committee, and whether such firm should be retained for the upcoming year's audit. 
 The Bank is one of 11 district Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) that, together with the Federal Home Loan Banks Office of Finance (Office of Finance), comprise the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBank System). Each FHLBank operates as a separate entity with its own management, employees and board of directors, and each is regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Office of Finance has responsibility for the issuance of consolidated obligations on behalf of the FHLBanks, and for publishing combined financial reports of the FHLBanks. Accordingly, the FHLBank System has determined that it is optimal to have the same independent registered public accounting firm to coordinate and perform the separate audits of the Office of Finance and annual financial statements of each FHLBank and the Office of Finance s annual combined financial report. The FHLBanks and Office of Finance cooperate in selecting and evaluating the performance of the independent auditor, but the responsibility for the appointment of and oversight of the independent auditor remains solely with the audit committees of each FHLBank and the Office of Finance. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has been the independent auditor for the FHLBank System and the Bank since 1990. In connection with the appointment of the Bank s independent auditor, the Audit Committee s evaluation included consultation with the audit committees of the other FHLBanks and the Office of Finance. Specific considerations included 
 an analysis of the risks and benefits of retaining the same firm as independent auditor versus engaging a different firm, including consideration of 
 PwC s engagement audit partner, engagement quality review partner and audit team rotation 
 PwC s tenure as the Bank s and the FHLBank System s independent auditor 
 benefits associated with engaging a different firm as independent auditor and 
 potential disruption and risks associated with changing the Bank s independent auditor. 
 the firm s depth and breadth of understanding of the Bank's business, operations, and accounting policies and practices 
 PwC s historical and recent performance on the Bank s audit, including the results of an internal survey of PwC service and quality 
 an analysis of PwC s known legal risks and significant proceedings 
 external data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB audit quality inspection reports on PwC and its peer firms and 
 the appropriateness of PwC s fees, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its peer firms. 

Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of the Bank s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and reviews of the Bank s quarterly financial statements, regulatory filings, consents and other SEC matters. The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the fees paid to the independent auditor for audit, audit-related and other services, and has determined that PwC is independent. 
 In its oversight role, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Bank s audited financial statements and its internal controls over financial reporting with management and with PwC as the Bank s independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management and PwC indicated that the Bank s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP and that the Bank s internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2023. The Audit Committee discussed with PwC and management the significant accounting policies used and significant estimates made by management in the preparation of the Bank s audited financial statements, and the overall quality of the Bank s financial statements and management's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee and PwC also discussed any issues deemed significant by PwC or the Audit Committee, including the matters required to be discussed pursuant to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301 Communications with Audit Committees, the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and other applicable regulations. 
 PwC has provided to the Audit Committee written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with PwC the firm s independence. 
 Based on its review of the audited financial statements and the various discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Bank s audited financial statements be included in the Bank s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.
