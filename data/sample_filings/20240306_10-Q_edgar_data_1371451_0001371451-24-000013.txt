 Overview 
 
 Highwater Ethanol, LLC we, our, Highwater Ethanol or the Company was formed as a Minnesota limited liability company organized on May 2, 2006, for the purpose of constructing, owning, and operating an ethanol plant near Lamberton, Minnesota. Since August 2009, we have been engaged in the production of ethanol and distillers grains at the plant. In October 2019, our air permit application to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to allow for 70.2 million gallons of denatured ethanol per 12-month rolling average was approved. 
 
 On November 16, 2023, our board of governors declared a cash distribution of 3,400 per membership unit to unit holders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2023, for a total distribution of 16,161,900. The distribution was paid on December 4, 2023. 
 
 On February 16, 2024, we amended our TFX Throughput Service Agreement (the "Amendment") with Northern Natural Gas Company ("NNG") for transportation of natural gas. The Amendment has an effective date of November 1, 2024 and extends the term through October 31, 2029. We will pay the tariff rate in effect from time to time for natural gas. NNG has allocated to us 5,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day. 
 
 We expect to fund our operations during the next 12 months using cash flow from our continuing operations and our current credit facilities. However, should we experience unfavorable operating conditions in the ethanol industry that prevent us 
 from profitably operating the ethanol plant, we may need to seek additional funding.

 Revenue 
 
 Ethanol 
 Our ethanol revenues were lower for the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. Revenue from ethanol sales decreased by approximately 25.4 during the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in the average price per gallon of ethanol sold during the three months ended January 31, 2024. 
 The average price per gallon of ethanol sold for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was approximately 26.4 lower than the average price we received for the three months ended January 31, 2023. Ethanol prices for the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023 were lower due primarily to lower corn and energy prices. 
 Factors likely to affect ethanol prices in the future include changes in domestic corn prices and corn supply, changes in energy prices and, potentially, year round sales of E-15. In addition, trade disputes with foreign governments, changes in foreign ethanol demand, changes in global economic conditions and increased volatility in commodity prices could impact the market price of ethanol. 
 The number of gallons of ethanol sold during the three months ended January 31, 2024 increased by approximately 1.5 , as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. Our ethanol production levels for the three months ended January 31, 2024 were at an annual rate of approximately 69 million gallons. Management anticipates that the amount of ethanol produced could decrease in the future if operating conditions worsen and we reduce ethanol production levels. Ethanol production could also decrease if delayed rail car shipments affect our ability to get sufficient rail cars to transport our ethanol. 
 We had gains related to ethanol based derivative instruments of 10,374 and 60,465 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These gains increased our ethanol revenue during these periods. 
 
 Distillers Grains 
 
 Revenue from distillers grains sales decreased by approximately 17.0 during the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023 primarily due to lower distillers grains prices during our three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended January 31, 2024, the average price per ton of dried distillers grains sold was approximately 12.2 lower than the average price we received during the three months ended January 31, 2023, due primarily to decreases in the domestic prices of corn and other feed products for the period. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, the average price per ton of modified distillers grains sold was approximately 22.8 lower than during the three months ended January 31, 2023, due to decreases in the price of corn and other feed products. 
 
 Distillers grains prices typically change in proportion to domestic corn and other feed products including soybeans. Domestic demand for distillers grains could decrease due to declining prices of corn or other feed products or decreasing cattle numbers resulting from droughts in the western and southern United States. Other factors likely to affect distillers grains prices include prices and availability of other commodities, the continued imposition by China of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on distillers grains produced in the United States and other trade actions by the United States and foreign governments. 
 
 18 

The tons of dried distillers grains sold during the three months ended January 31, 2024, increased by approximately 6.3 , as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. The tons of modified distillers grains sold during the three months ended January 31, 2024, decreased by approximately 15.9 , as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. Management anticipates that the amount of distillers grains produced may decrease in the future if operating conditions worsen and there is a reduction in ethanol production levels which would then have a corresponding effect on distillers grains. In addition, an increase in ethanol or corn oil yields could have a negative effect of distillers grains production levels. 
 
 Corn Oil 
 
 Revenue from corn oil sales decreased by approximately 25.9 during the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. This is primarily the result of a decrease in the price of corn oil sold during the three months ended January 31, 2024, partially offset by an increase in pounds of corn oil sold for the period. The average price per pound of corn oil sold was approximately 27.4 lower during the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023, due primarily to an increase in corn oil and soy oil production which outpaced demand. Factors likely to affect corn oil prices include corn oil and soy oil supply, biodiesel demand, prices of corn and soybeans, the status of the biodiesel blenders' tax credit and new crop corn oil content. 
 
 The pounds of corn oil sold during the three months ended January 31, 2024, increased by approximately 1.5 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. Management anticipates that the amount of corn oil produced may decrease in the future if there is a reduction in ethanol production levels which would then have a corresponding effect on corn oil. However, an increase in corn oil yields due to improved efficiencies or a corn crop with higher oil content could contribute to higher corn oil production levels. 
 
 At January 31, 2024, we had 2,192,480 pounds of forward corn oil sales contracts valued at approximately 1,088,000 for various delivery periods through March 31, 2024. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Our two largest costs of production are corn (76.5 of cost of goods sold for the three months ended January 31, 2024) and natural gas (7.1 of cost of goods sold for the three months ended January 31, 2024). Our total cost of goods sold was approximately 21.8 less during the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. 
 
 Corn 
 
 Our average price per bushel of corn for the three months ended January 31, 2024 decreased by approximately 27.4 per bushel, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023, primarily due to a lower market value for corn as a result of increases in projected stocks due to a large fall corn crop in the United States. We used approximately 2 less bushels of corn in the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. 
 
 Management expects there to be an adequate corn supply available in our area to operate the ethanol plant. However, corn prices are dependent on weather conditions, supply and demand, stocks and other factors which could contribute to price volatility and significantly impact our costs of production. In addition, corn prices could continue to be impacted in the future by global economic uncertainty, rising inflation, market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices. 
 
 At January 31, 2024, we had 3,161,453 bushels of forward fixed basis corn purchase contracts and 2,206,666 bushels of forward fixed price corn contracts valued at approximately 10,072,000. These purchase contracts are for various delivery periods through December 31, 2025. 
 
 We had gains (losses) related to corn derivative instruments of 10,801) and 313,674 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which reduced (increased) our cost of goods sold during these periods. 

19 

Natural Gas 
 
 The average market price per MMBTU of natural gas was approximately 29.4 higher for the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023, due primarily to higher transportation rates paid to Northern Natural Gas Company. Factors such as industry production problems or large increases in natural gas demand in the future could also have a negative effect on natural gas prices. 
 
 For the three months ended January 31, 2024, we used approximately the same MMBTUs of natural gas as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. 
 
 At January 31, 2024, we had 2,327,150 MMBTUs of forward natural gas purchase contracts valued at approximately 8,219,000 for various delivery periods through March 31, 2027. 
 
 We had gains related to natural gas derivative instruments of 10,043 and 83,875, which reduced our cost of goods sold during these periods. 
 
 Operating Expense 
 
 We had operating expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2024 of 1,283,471, as compared to operating expenses of 1,198,113 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. Management attributes this increase in operating expenses primarily to an increase in insurance and consulting fees for the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2023. Management continues to pursue strategies to optimize efficiencies and maximize production. These efforts may result in a decrease in our operating expenses on a per gallon basis. However, because these expenses do not vary with the level of production at the plant, we expect our operating expenses to remain relatively steady. 
 
 Other Income, net 
 
 We had total other income, net for the three months ended January 31, 2024 of 472,472, as compared to 180,989 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. Our other income, net for the three months ended January 31, 2024, was higher due primarily to an increase in interest income. 
 
 Changes in Financial Condition for the Three Months Ended January 31, 2024 
 
 The following table highlights the changes in our financial condition as of January 31, 2024 from our previous fiscal year ended October 31, 2023: 
 January 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 Current Assets 42,660,999 62,247,517 Current Liabilities 15,624,273 20,565,125 Long-Term Liabilities 745,928 780,059 
 Current Assets 
 
 The decrease in current assets is primarily the result of decreases in cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2024, as compared to October 31, 2023, due primarily to cash distributions of 16,161,900 paid to our members on December 4, 2023. 
 
 Current Liabilities 
 
 The decrease in current liabilities is primarily the result of decreases in accounts payable at January 31, 2024, as compared to October 31, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in corn prices. 
 
 Long-Term Liabilities 
 
 Long-term liabilities decreased at January 31, 2024, as compared to October 31, 2023, due primarily to decreasing liabilities owed under a contract for use of a natural gas pipeline to transport natural gas to our facility. 
 
 20 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Based on financial forecasts prepared by our management, we anticipate that we will have sufficient cash on hand, cash from our current credit facilities, and cash from our operations to continue to operate the ethanol plant for the next 12 months. We do not currently anticipate seeking additional equity or debt financing in the near term in order to fund operations. However, if market conditions worsen, we could have difficulty maintaining our liquidity and may need to rely on our revolving lines of credit or seek increases. 
 
 The following table shows cash flows for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023: 
 2024 2023 (unaudited) (unaudited) Net cash used in operating activities (944,452) (867,584) Net cash used in investing activities (1,547,661) (121,576) Net cash used in financing activities (16,194,206) (15,289,583) 
 
 Cash Flow From Operations 
 
 We used more cash in operating activities for the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to a decrease in net income and changes in accounts receivable and inventories for the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Cash Flow From Investing Activities 
 
 We used more cash in investing activities for the three months period ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. This change was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures during the three months ended January 31, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flow From Financing Activities 
 
 We used more cash in financing activities during the three month ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Our cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to increased distributions to our members during the three months ended January 31, 2024. 
 
 Short-Term and Long-Term Debt Sources 
 
 Our loan facility with Compeer Financial f/k/a AgStar Financial Services, PCA ("Compeer") includes a 20,000,000 Term Revolving Loan and a Revolving Line of Credit Loan. Our loan facility with Compeer is secured by substantially all business assets and also subjects the Company to various financial and non-financial covenants. 
 
 Term Revolving Loan 
 
 The Term Revolving Loan is for up to 20,000,000 with a variable interest rate based on the Wall Street Journal's Prime Rate plus 10 basis points with a minimum interest rate of 2.10 . The applicable interest rate at January 31, 2024 was 8.60 . The Term Revolving Loan may be advanced, repaid and re-borrowed during the term. Monthly interest payments are due on the Term Revolving Loan with payment of all amounts outstanding due on November 1, 2027. The outstanding balance on this note was 0 at January 31, 2024. We pay interest at a rate of 1.50 on amounts outstanding for letters of credit which also reduce the amount available under the Term Revolving Loan. We had no letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2024. We are also required to pay unused commitment fees for the Term Revolving Loan. 
 
 Revolving Line of Credit Loan 
 
 The Revolving Line of Credit Loan is for an amount equal to the borrowing base, with a maximum limit of 10,000,000 with a variable interest rate based on the Wall Street Journal's Prime Rate plus 10 basis points with a minimum interest rate of 2.10 . The amount available to borrow per the borrowing base calculations at January 31, 2024 was approximately 0. The applicable interest rate at January 31, 2024 was 8.60 . The Revolving Line of Credit Loan may be advanced, repaid and re-borrowed during the term. Monthly interest payments are due on the Revolving Line of Credit Loan with payment of all amounts outstanding due on November 1, 2024. The maturity date may be extended for up to four 
 21 

additional one year terms upon our written request which will be deemed automatically granted by Compeer upon written certification that there is no event of default. The Company has previously been granted one extension. The outstanding balance on this note was 0 at January 31, 2024. We are also required to pay unused commitment fees for the Revolving Line of Credit Loan. 
 
 Covenants and Other Miscellaneous Financing Agreement Terms 
 
 The loan facility with Compeer is secured by substantially all business assets. We executed a mortgage in favor of Compeer creating a first lien on our real estate and plant and a security interest in all personal property located on the premises and assigned in favor of Compeer, all rents and leases to our property, our marketing contracts, our risk management services contract, and our natural gas, electricity, water service and grain procurement agreements. 
 
 We are also subject to various financial and non-financial covenants that limit distributions and new debt and require minimum working capital requirements. We are limited to annual capital expenditures of 5,000,000 without prior approval, incurring additional debt over certain amounts without prior approval, and making additional investments as described in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement without prior approval of Compeer. We are required to maintain a minimum working capital requirement of 9,000,000, which is calculated as current assets plus the amount available for drawing under the Term Revolving Loan and undrawn amounts on outstanding letters of credit, less current liabilities, and is measured quarterly. We are allowed to make cash distributions to members as frequently as monthly in an amount equal to 75 of net income if working capital is greater than or equal to 9,000,000, or an unlimited amount if working capital is greater than or equal to 12,000,000. 
 
 Presently, we are meeting our liquidity needs and complying with our financial covenants and the other terms of our loan agreements. We will continue to work with Compeer to try to ensure that the terms of our loan agreements are met going forward. However, we cannot provide any assurance that our actions will result in sustained profitable operations or that we will not be in violation of our loan covenants or in default on our principal payments in the future. Should unfavorable market conditions result in our violation of the terms or covenants of our loan and we fail to obtain a waiver of any such term or covenant, Compeer could deem us in default of our loans and require us to immediately repay a significant portion or possibly the entire outstanding balance of our loans. In the event of a default, Compeer could also elect to proceed with a foreclosure action on our plant. 
 
 Grants 
 
 The Minnesota State Legislature established the Bioincentive Program in 2015 to encourage commercial-scale production of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals, and biomass thermal energy through production incentive payments. Eligible producers of cellulosic ethanol may receive 0.16 per gallon of cellulosic ethanol produced subject to program funding limitations. On February 20, 2024, we received an award from the Bioincentive Program of approximately 92,000. The award was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 in other income. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 We commenced a construction project during our 2023 fiscal year to expand our lab and add additional office space. We anticipate that the project will be completed during the second quarter of our 2024 fiscal year, cost approximately 1,000,000 and be funded from operations. 
 
 We have also approved a project to add an additional fermentation tank which is expected to increase efficiencies, cost approximately 4,000,000, and be funded from operations and existing debt facilities. We entered into an agreement on December 21, 2023 with Nelson Baker Biotech, Inc. to construct the fermentation tank. We expect that construction will commence in spring of 2024 and be completed in the fall of 2024. The amendment to our air permit to add the fermentation tank was approved by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on March 4, 2022. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Management uses various estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Accounting estimates that are the most important to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgment by management, are designated as our critical accounting estimates. We have the following critical accounting estimates: 
 22 

Long-Lived Assets 
 
 We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment testing for assets requires various estimates and assumptions, including an allocation of cash flows to those assets and, if required, an estimate of the fair value of those assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. Given the significant assumptions required and the possibility that actual conditions will differ, we consider the assessment of carrying value of property and equipment to be a critical accounting estimate. 
 
 Inventory Valuation 
 
 We value our inventory at lower of cost or net realizable value. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management's assumptions which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. In our analysis, we consider corn costs and ethanol prices, break-even points for our plant and our risk management strategies in place through our derivative instruments. Given the significant assumptions required and the possibility that actual conditions will differ, we consider the valuation of the lower of cost or net realizable value on inventory to be a critical accounting estimate. 
 
 Derivatives 
 
 We are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, corn, natural gas, and ethanol prices. We may seek to minimize these commodity price fluctuation risks through the use of derivative instruments. In the event we utilize derivative instruments, we will attempt to link these instruments to financing plans, sales plans, market developments, and pricing activities. Such instruments in and of themselves can result in additional costs due to unexpected directional price movements. 
 
 We have entered into ethanol, corn and natural gas derivatives in order to protect cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in commodity prices. In practice, as markets move, we actively attempt to manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate. We do not use hedge accounting which would match the gain or loss on our hedge positions to the specific commodity contracts being hedged. Instead, we use fair value accounting for our hedge positions, which means that as the current market price of our hedge position changes, the gains and losses are immediately recognized in our statement of operations. The immediate recognition of hedging gains and losses under fair value accounting can cause net income (loss) to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged. 
 
 As of January 31, 2024, the fair values of our commodity-based derivative instruments are a net liability of approximately 1,210,000. As the prices of the hedged commodity moves in reaction to market trends and information, our statement of operations will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments. Depending on market movements, crop prospects and weather, these price protection positions may cause immediate adverse effects, but are expected to protect the Company over the term of the contracts for the hedged amounts. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with interest rates and commodity prices as discussed below. We have no exposure to foreign currency risk as all of our business is conducted in U.S. Dollars. We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We may use cash, futures and option contracts to hedge changes to the commodity prices of corn and natural gas. We do not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from our Term Revolving Loan and Revolving Line of Credit Loan, each bearing a variable interest rate. As of January 31, 2024, we had 0 outstanding on the Term Revolving Loan and the Revolving Line of Credit Loan. As of January 31, 2024, interest accrues on these loans at a variable interest rate based on the Wall Street Journal's Prime Rate plus 10 basis points with a minimum interest rate of 2.10 and the applicable interest rate was 8.60 . Given the balance owed on these loans as of January 31, 2024, we have determined that our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates is not material. The specifics of each loan are discussed in greater detail in Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources . 
 23 

Commodity Price Risk 
 
 We expect to be exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices. Exposure to commodity price risk results from our dependence on corn and natural gas in the ethanol production process and the sale of ethanol and distillers grains. We may seek to minimize the risks from fluctuations in the prices of raw material inputs through the use of corn commodity-based and natural gas derivatives. These derivatives are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes. For derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges, or for the ineffective portions of qualifying hedges, the change in fair value is recorded through earnings in the period of change. Corn and natural gas derivative changes in fair market value are included in costs of goods sold. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into forward contracts for our commodity purchases. At January 31, 2024, we had 3,161,453 bushels of forward fixed basis corn purchase contracts and 2,206,666 bushels of forward fixed price corn purchase contracts valued at approximately 10,072,000. These purchase contracts are for various delivery periods through December 31, 2025. At January 31, 2024, we had 2,327,150 MMBTUs of forward natural gas fixed price purchase contracts valued at approximately 8,219,000 for delivery periods through March 31, 2027. In addition, at January 31, 2024, we had 138,750 gallons of forward fixed price denaturant purchase contracts valued at approximately 229,000 for delivery periods through February 29, 2024. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into forward contracts for our commodity sales. At January 31, 2024, we had 3,526 tons of forward fixed price dried distillers grains sales contracts valued at approximately 673,000 for delivery periods through March 31, 2024. At January 31, 2024, we had 20,500 tons of forward fixed price modified distillers grains sales contracts valued at approximately 1,894,000 for delivery periods through September 30, 2024. At January 31, 2024, we had 2,192,480 pounds of forward fixed price corn oil sales contracts valued at approximately 1,088,000 for delivery periods through March 31, 2024. 
 We recorded gains (losses) due to changes in the fair value of our outstanding corn derivative future positions of approximately 10,801) and 313,674 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded gains due to changes in the fair value of our outstanding ethanol derivative future positions of approximately 10,374 and 60,465 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded gains due to the change in fair value of our outstanding natural gas derivative future positions of approximately 10,043 and 83,875, respectively. 
 
 As commodity prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments. Depending on market movements, crop prospects and weather, these price protection positions may cause immediate adverse effects, but are expected to produce long-term positive growth for us. 
 
 A sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to ethanol, distillers grains, corn and natural gas price risk. Market risk related to these factors is estimated as the potential change in income resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in the average cost of our corn and natural gas prices and average ethanol and distillers grains prices as of January 31, 2024, net of the forward and future contracts used to hedge our market risk for corn and natural gas usage requirements. The volumes are based on our expected use and sale of these commodities for a one year period from January 31, 2024. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are approximately as follows: 
 Estimated Volume Requirements for the next 12 months (net of forward and futures contracts) Unit of Measure Hypothetical Adverse Change in Price as of January 31, 2024 Approximate Adverse Change to Income Natural Gas 322,000 MMBTU 10 67,620 Ethanol 69,000,000 Gallons 10 9,660,000 Corn 17,661,881 Bushels 10 7,594,609 DDGs 116,474 Tons 10 2,236,300
