 shares of its common stock, par value , including the underwriters over-allotment, at a price of per share with net proceeds of approximately million. CM Finance LLC, a Maryland limited liability company, commenced operations in March 2012. Immediately prior to the Offering, CM Finance LLC was merged with and into the Company (the Merger ). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued shares of common stock and million in debt to the pre-existing CM Finance LLC investors, consisting of funds managed by Cyrus Capital Partners, L.P. (the Original Investors or the Cyrus Funds ). The Company had no assets or operations prior to completion of the Merger and, as a result, the books and records of CM Finance LLC became the books and records of the Company, as the surviving entity. Immediately after the Merger, the Company issued shares of its common stock to Stifel Venture Corp. Stifel in exchange for million in cash. The Company used all of the proceeds of the sale of shares to Stifel to repurchase shares of common stock from the Original Investors. Immediately after the completion of the Offering, the Company had shares outstanding. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering to repay of the debt issued to the Original Investors in connection with the Merger. CM Investment Partners LLC (the Adviser serves as the Company s investment adviser. On August 30, 2019, Investcorp Credit Management US LLC Investcorp ), a subsidiary of Investcorp Bank Holdings B.S.C., acquired the interests in the Adviser, which were previously held by the Cyrus Funds and Stifel and paid off certain debt owed by the Adviser, resulting in Investcorp having a majority ownership interest in the Adviser (the Investcorp Transaction ). On August 30, 2019, CM Finance, Inc. changed its name to Investcorp Credit Management BDC, Inc. In connection with the Investcorp Transaction, on June 26, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase and transaction agreement with Investcorp BDC Holdings Limited Investcorp BDC ), an affiliate of Investcorp (the Stock Purchase Agreement ). Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Investcorp BDC was required by August 30, 2021 to purchase (i) newly issued shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share, at the most recently determined net asset value per share of the Company s common stock at the time of such purchase, as adjusted as necessary to comply with Section 23 of the 1940 Act, and (ii) shares of the Company s common stock in open-market or secondary transactions. Investcorp BDC has completed all required purchases under the Stock Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Investcorp Transaction, on June 26, 2019, the Company s board of directors, including all of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (each, an Independent Director ), unanimously approved a new investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement which was subsequently approved by the Company s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held on August 28, 2019. In connection with the closing of the Investcorp Transaction, on August 30, 2019, the Company entered into the Advisory Agreement and a new administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with the Adviser as its investment adviser and administrator, respectively. The Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement are substantially similar to the Company s prior investment advisory agreement between the Company and the Adviser and the Company s prior administration agreement, respectively. The Company s primary investment objective is to maximize total return to stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by investing directly in debt and related equity of privately held middle-market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. The Company invests primarily in middle-market companies in the form of standalone first and second lien loans, unitranche loans and mezzanine loans. The Company may also invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments. As a BDC, the Company is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, the Company must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets, as defined in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least of total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets generally include investments in eligible portfolio companies, which, under the 1940 Act, are generally defined as any issuer that (1) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business, in the United States; (2) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and (3) either does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States. From time-to-time, the Company may form taxable subsidiaries that are taxed as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the Taxable Subsidiaries ). At December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 , the Company had Taxable Subsidiaries. The Taxable Subsidiaries, if any, allow the Company to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements applicable to a RIC under the Code. 

and of prepayment penalties and unamortized discounts upon prepayment were recorded as investment income. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and of prepayment penalties and unamortized discounts upon prepayment were recorded as interest income. Structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned, usually when received. Structuring fees, excess deal deposits, net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other fee income. Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. However, capitalized PIK interest will not be reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current, although management may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had seven loans on non-accrual status, 1888 Industrial Services, LLC Term A, Term C and Revolver, American Nuts Holdings, LLC - Term B, American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. (d/b/a Premiere Global Services, Inc.) Revolver, CareerBuilder, LLC and Klein Hersh, LLC, which collectively represented of the Company s portfolio at fair value. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had loans on non-accrual status, 1888 Industrial Services, LLC Term A, Term C and Revolver, American Nuts Holdings, LLC - Term A and Term B, and American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. (d/b/a Premiere Global Services, Inc.) Revolver, which collectively represented of the Company s portfolio at fair value. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are determined by calculating the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investments, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method. The Company reports changes in fair value of investments as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company holds debt investments in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind PIK interest provision. PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. PIK interest is not accrued if the Company does not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due. The Company earned PIK interest of and during the three and six months ended December 31, 2023. The Company earned PIK interest of and during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. The Company may hold equity investments in its portfolio that contain a PIK dividend provision. PIK dividends, which represent contractual dividend payments added to the investment balance, are recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company earned PIK dividends of and during the three and six months ended December 31, 2023. The Company earned PIK dividends of and during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 . 

The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of the Company s stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Company s board of directors authorizes, and the Company declares, a cash distribution, then the Company s stockholders who have not opted out of the Company s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. 

extent these securities are actively traded, and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company held no Level 1 investments as of December 31, 2023 or June 30, 2023. Investments that are not traded on securities exchanges but are traded on the over-the-counter OTC markets (such as term loans, notes and warrants) are valued using various techniques, which may consider recently executed transactions in securities of the issuer or comparable issuers, market price quotations (when observable) and fundamental data relating to the issuer. These investments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or in instances when lower relative weight is placed on transaction prices, quotations, or similar observable inputs, they are categorized in Level 3. Investments for which market quotations are not readily available or may be considered unreliable are fair valued, in good faith, using a method determined to be appropriate in the given circumstances. The valuation methods used include the Cost Approach, the Market Approach and the Income Approach. Inputs used in these approaches may include, but are not limited to, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, recovery rates, comparable company transactions, trading multiples, and volatilities. The valuation method the Company uses may change as changes in the underlying portfolio company dictates, such as moving from the Cost Approach to Market Approach when underlying conditions change at the company. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation in these circumstances, the fair values for the aforementioned investments may differ significantly from values that would have been used had a ready and liquid market for such investments existed or from the amounts that might ultimately be realized, and such differences could be material. The Adviser seeks to ensure that the Company s valuation policies and procedures, as approved by the Company s board of directors, are consistently applied across all investments of the Company. The valuations are continuously monitored and the valuation process for Level 3 investments is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level 3 investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight and review. The valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment. These investment professionals prepare the preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable securities from the same company or that of comparable companies as well as any other relevant factors including recent purchases and sales that may have occurred preceding month-end. Valuation models are typically calibrated upon initial funding and are re-calibrated as necessary upon subsequent material events (including, but not limited to additional financing activity, changes in comparable companies, and recent trades). The preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of the Adviser. On a periodic basis and at least once annually, one or more third-party independent valuation firm(s) engaged by the Company conduct independent appraisals and review the Adviser s preliminary valuations and make their own independent assessment. The Valuation Committee of the Company s board of directors then reviews the preliminary valuations of the Adviser and, as applicable, that of any independent valuation firms. The Valuation Committee discusses the valuations and makes a recommendation to the Company s board of directors regarding the fair value of each investment in good faith based on the input of the Adviser and the independent valuation firm(s). Upon recommendation by the Valuation Committee and a review of the valuation materials of the Adviser and the third-party independent valuation firm(s), the board of directors of the Company determines, in good faith, the fair value of each investment. For more information on the classification of the Company s investments by major categories, see Note 4. The fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments under U.S. GAAP approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
 of the Company s investment company taxable income, which is generally the Company s net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses. If the Company continues to qualify as a RIC and continues to satisfy the annual distribution requirement, the Company will not have to pay corporate level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that the Company distributes to its stockholders. The Company intends to make distributions in an amount sufficient to maintain RIC status each year and to avoid any federal income taxes on income. The Company will also be subject to nondeductible U.S. federal excise taxes if the Company does not distribute to its stockholders at least of net ordinary income, of capital gains, if any, and any recognized and undistributed income from prior years for which it paid no U.S. federal income taxes. Additionally, certain of the Company s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no Taxable Subsidiaries. The Company incurred excise tax expenses, which are included in the provision for tax expense of and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, and and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. Book and tax basis differences that are permanent differences are reclassified among the Company s capital accounts, as appropriate at year-end. Additionally, the tax character of distributions is determined in accordance with the Code, which differs from U.S. GAAP. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded distributions of and . During the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded distributions of and . For certain periods, the tax character of a portion of distributions may be return of capital. U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. The Company s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the tax provision. The Company has analyzed such tax positions and has concluded that no unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded for uncertain tax positions for any tax year since inception. The tax years ended June 30, 2020 through present remain subject to examinations by taxing authorities. This conclusion may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors, including but not limited to, ongoing analysis and changes to laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof. Permanent differences between investment company taxable income and net investment income for financial reporting purposes are reclassified among capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. Differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

Distributable earnings

Distributable earnings (loss) 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, net realized capital losses may be carried over to offset future capital gains, if any. These capital losses can be carried forward for an indefinite period and will retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had a net short-term capital loss carryforward of and a net long-term capital loss carryforward of available to be carried forward for an indefinite period. A RIC may elect to defer any capital losses incurred after October 31 of a taxable year post-October to the beginning of the following fiscal year. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had a post-October short-term capital loss deferral of and a post-October long-term capital loss deferral of . These losses were deemed to arise on July 1, 2023. 
 Fee is subject to the performance of investments until there is a realization event, the amount of provisional Capital Gains Fee accrued at a reporting date may vary from the incentive fee that is ultimately realized and the differences could be material. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) commencing with the Company s fiscal year ending on June 30, 2021, and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of the Company s cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (2) the Company s cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from June 30, 2020. If the amount so calculated is positive, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to 20 of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years under the Advisory Agreement. If such amount is negative, then no Capital Gains Fee will be payable for such year. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee was not charged until the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 , there was no Capital Gains Fee payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement.

The Company s primary investment objective is to maximize total return to stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by investing directly in debt and related equity of privately held middle-market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. During the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company made investments in new and existing portfolio companies of approximately million , to which it was not previously contractually committed to provide financial support. During the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company made investments of approximately million in companies to which it was previously committed to provide financial support through the terms of the revolvers and delayed draw term loans. The details of the Company s investments have been disclosed on the Unaudited Consolidated Schedule of Investments. c. Derivatives Derivative contracts include total return swaps and embedded derivatives in the Company s borrowings. The Company may enter into derivative contracts as part of its investment strategies. On October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted a rule that modifies the conditions by which BDCs can enter into, or cover open positions pursuant to, certain derivatives contracts that involve potential future payment obligations (the Derivatives Rule ). The Derivatives Rule requires a BDC entering into a derivatives contract to develop and implement a derivatives risk management program, to comply with an outer limit on asset coverage ratio based on the VaR value-at-risk test, and to report its derivative activity to its board of directors on a regular basis. At December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 , the Company held derivative contracts. d. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability based upon their transparency. The valuation hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value have been classified in the following three categories: Level 1 valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly; (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; or (d) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3 valuation is based on unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available under the circumstances, which might include the Company s own data. The Company s own data used to develop unobservable inputs is adjusted if information is reasonably available without undue cost and effort that indicates that market participants would use different assumptions. The availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of the market and other characteristics particular to the security. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. Estimates of fair value for cash and restricted cash are measured using observable, quoted market prices, or Level 1 inputs. All other fair value significant estimates are measured using unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs.

Transfers out of Level 3 during or at the end of the reporting period are reported under Level 3 as of the beginning of the period. Changes in unrealized gains (losses) relating to Level 3 instruments are included in net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments and derivatives on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company did t transfer any investments among Levels 1, 2 and 3. The following tables provide quantitative information regarding the Company s Level 3 fair value measurements as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 . This information presents the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of investment. These inputs are not representative of the inputs that could have been used in the valuation of any one investment. For example, the highest market yield presented in the table for senior secured notes is appropriate for valuing a specific investment but may not be appropriate for valuing any other investment. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company s Level 3 investments. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, according to our valuation policy we may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining our fair value measurements.

Fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value and such changes could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value. Significant increases in illiquidity discounts, PIK discounts and market yields would result in significantly lower fair value measurements. 

 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Capital One Revolving Financing with Capital One, N.A. Capital One ), which is secured by collateral consisting primarily of loans in the Company s investment portfolio. On June 14, 2023, we amended the Capital One Revolving Financing to decrease the facility size from million to million. The Capital One Revolving Financing, which will expire on (the Maturity Date ), features a reinvestment period and a amortization period. Effective November 18, 2022, borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus . The default interest rate will be equal to the interest rate then in effect plus . million) of the available borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing at the closing, and requires the payment of an unused fee of (i) annually for any undrawn amounts below of the Capital One Revolving Financing, (ii) annually for any undrawn amounts between and of the Capital One Revolving Financing, and (iii) annually for any undrawn amounts above of the Capital One Revolving Financing. Borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing are based on a borrowing base. The Capital One Revolving Financing generally requires payment of interest and fees on a quarterly basis. All outstanding principal is due on the Maturity Date. The Capital One Revolving Financing also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, there were million and million in borrowings outstanding under the Capital One Revolving Financing, respectively. Restricted cash (as shown on the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities) is held by the trustee of the Capital One Revolving Financing and is restricted to purchases of investments by SPV LLC that must meet certain eligibility criteria identified by the loan, security and investment management agreement governing the Capital One Revolving Financing. As of December 31, 2023, SPV LLC had a notional amount of million , which included million of the Company s portfolio investments at fair value, accrued interest receivable and million in cash held by the trustees of the Capital One Revolving Financing. As of June 30, 2023 , SPV and LLC had a notional amount of million in assets with a fair value of million, accrued interest receivable and million in cash held by the trustee of the Capital One Revolving Financing. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, the weighted average outstanding debt balance and the weighted average stated interest rate under the Capital One Revolving Financing was million and million, respectively, and and , respectively. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 , the weighted average outstanding debt balance and the weighted average stated interest rate under the Capital One Revolving Financing was million and million, respectively, and and , respectively. For more information, see Note 15. Subsequent Events. The fair value of the Company s borrowings is estimated based on the rate at which similar credit facilities or debentures would be priced. At December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the fair value of the Company s total borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing, was estimated at million and million respectively, which the Company concluded was a Level 3 fair value. On March 31, 2021, the Company closed the public offering of million in aggregate principal amount of notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes ). The total net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 2026 Notes, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million and estimated offering expenses of approximately , were approximately million. The 2026 Notes will mature on , unless previously redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms, and bear interest at a rate of . The 2026 Notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu , which means equal in right of payment, with all outstanding and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness issued by the Company. Because the 2026 Notes are not secured by any of the Company s assets, they are effectively subordinated to all of the Company s existing and future secured unsubordinated indebtedness (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured as to which the Company subsequently grants a security interest), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s subsidiaries and financing vehicles, including, without limitation, borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing. The 2026 Notes are obligations exclusively of the Company and not of any of the Company s subsidiaries. None of the Company s subsidiaries is a guarantor of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes will not be required to be guaranteed by any subsidiary the Company may acquire or create in the future. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option, upon not less than days nor more than days written notice by mail prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof, at a redemption price (as determined by the Company) equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date: , however, that if the Company redeems any 2026 Notes on or after January 1, 2026 (the date falling three months prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes), the redemption price for the 2026 Notes will be equal to of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided, further, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a 2026 Note not redeemed to less than . Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2021. The Company may from time to time repurchase 2026 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the 2026 Notes was million on an aggregate principal balance of million at an effective yield of . As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2026 Notes was million . The Company concluded that this was Level 3 fair value under ASC 820. Long-Term Debt Maturities

Advisory Agreement The Company is party to the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Base Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents (such amount, Gross Assets ). For the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, and in Base Management Fees were earned by the Adviser, of which and was voluntarily waived. As of December 31, 2023, of such fees were payable. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, and in Base Management Fees were earned by the Adviser, of which and was voluntarily waived. As of June 30, 2023, of such fees were payable. There is no guarantee that the Adviser will waive Base Management Fees in the future. Any portion of the Base Management Fee waived is not subject to recapture. The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of the Company s Gross Assets at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters prior to the quarter for which such fees are being calculated. The Base Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the Base Management Fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Income-Based Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, subject to a total return requirement (the Total Return Requirement and deferral of non-cash amounts, and is of the amount, if any, by which the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets attributable to its common stock, for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter, exceeds a (which is annualized) hurdle rate and a catch-up provision measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, in any fiscal quarter, the Adviser receives no Income-Based Fee until the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate of , but then receives, as a catch-up, of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than (which is annualized). The effect of the catch-up provision is that, subject to the Total Return Requirement and deferral provisions discussed below, if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds in any fiscal quarter, the Adviser receives of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. No Income-Based Fee is payable under the Advisory Agreement except to the extent of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations over the fiscal quarter for which fees are being calculated and the Lookback Period (as defined below) exceeds the cumulative Incentive Fees accrued and/or paid for the Lookback Period. The cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations is the amount, if positive, of the sum of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the then current fiscal quarter and the Lookback Period. The Lookback Period means (1) through June 30, 2022, the period that commences on the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the Advisory Agreement became effective and ends on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the fiscal quarter for which the Income-Based Fee is being calculated, and (2) after June 30, 2022, the eleven fiscal quarters immediately preceding the fiscal quarter for which the Income-Based Fee is being calculated. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company wrote off in previously deferred Income-Based Fees and incurred Income-Based Fees. As of December 31, 2023, in incentive fees related to Income-Based Fees incurred by the Company are payable to the Adviser, of which fees of are payable and fees of generated from deferred interest (i.e., PIK and certain discount accretion) are not payable until such amounts are received in cash. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, the Company wrote off and in previously deferred Income-Based Fees and incurred Income-Based Fees. As of June 30, 2023, in incentive fees related to Income-Based Fees incurred by the Company are payable to the Adviser, of which fees of are payable and fees of generated from deferred interest (i.e., PIK and certain discount accretion) are not payable until such amounts are received in cash. Any voluntary waivers of the incentive fee in no way implies that the Adviser will agree to waive any incentive fee in any future period. Any portion of the incentive fees waived are not subject to recapture. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, and is equal to of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from the Commencement Date through the end of that fiscal year, computed net of the Company s aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fees. If such amount is negative, then no Capital Gains Fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains Fee. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee was not charged until the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company calculates the Capital Gains Fee as if it had realized all assets at their fair values as of the reporting date. Accordingly, the Company accrues a provisional Capital Gains Fee taking into account any unrealized gains or losses. As the provisional Capital Gains Fee is subject to the performance of investments until there is a realization event, the amount of the provisional Capital Gains Fee accrued at a reporting date may vary from the Capital Gains Fee that is ultimately realized and the differences could be material. As of December 31, 2023 , there was Capital Gains Fee accrued, earned or payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. As of June 30, 2023 , there was Capital Gains Fee accrued, earned or payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. The Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Adviser s duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from the Company for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the Adviser s services under the Advisory Agreement or otherwise as the Adviser. Mr. Mauer holds an approximate interest in the Adviser. Investcorp holds an approximate ownership interest in the Adviser. Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to the Adviser a Base Management Fee and an Incentive Fee. Mr. Mauer, an interested member of the Board, has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the Adviser. The Incentive Fee will be computed and paid on income that we may not have yet received in cash at the time of payment. This fee structure may create an incentive for the Adviser to invest in certain types of speculative securities. Additionally, the Company will rely on investment professionals from the Adviser to assist the Board with the valuation of the Company s portfolio investments. The Adviser s Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee is based on the value of our investments and, therefore, there may be a conflict of interest when personnel of the Adviser are involved in the valuation process for the Company s portfolio investments. As of December 31, 2023, the Company reflected a due from affiliate balance of on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities for an overpayment of expenses owed to the Adviser for administrative expenses incurred. There was due from affiliate balance as of June 30, 2023. Administration Agreement Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Adviser furnishes the Company with office facilities and equipment and provides it with the clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations. Under the Administration Agreement, the Adviser performs, or oversees the performance of the Company s required administrative services, which includes, among other things, being responsible for the financial records which it is required to maintain and preparing reports to its stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists the Company in determining and publishing its net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of its tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to its stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of its expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to it by others. Under the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides managerial assistance on the Company s behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted its offer to provide such assistance. In addition, the Adviser may satisfy certain of its obligations to the Company under the Administration Agreement through the services agreement with Investcorp International Inc., an affiliate of Investcorp, including supplying the Company with accounting and back-office professionals upon the request of the Adviser. The Company reimburses the Administrator or its affiliates for amounts paid or costs borne that properly constitute Company expenses as set forth in the Administration Agreement. Payments under the Administration Agreement equal an amount based upon the Company s allocable portion (subject to the review of the Company s board of directors) of the Adviser s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of the Company s chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Company incurred costs of and under the Administration Agreement for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023. The Company incurred costs of and under the Administration Agreement for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the Company recorded an Allocation of Administrative Costs from Adviser Payable of and , respectively, reported within Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities for reimbursement of expenses owed to the Adviser under the Administration Agreement. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 , the Company recorded approximately of expenses that related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Of this amount, approximately related to expenses allocated from the Adviser. Stock Purchase Agreement In connection with the Investcorp Transaction, on June 26, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase and transaction agreement with Investcorp BDC Holdings Limited Investcorp BDC ), an affiliate of Investcorp (the Stock Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which Investcorp BDC was required by August 30, 2021, to purchase (i) newly issued shares of the Company s common stock, at the most recently determined net asset value per share of the Company s common stock at the time of such purchase, as adjusted as necessary to comply with Section 23 of the 1940 Act, and (ii) shares of the Company s common stock in open-market or secondary transactions. Investcorp BDC completed all remaining required purchases under the Stock Purchase Agreement during the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Co-investment Exemptive Relief On July 20, 2021, the SEC issued an order, which superseded a prior order issued on March 19, 2019, granting the Company s application for exemptive relief to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and any future funds that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliated investment advisers (the Exemptive Relief ). Under the terms of the Exemptive Relief, in order for the Company to participate in a co-investment transaction a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (each, an Independent Director must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and its stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the Company s investment objectives and strategies. License Agreement The Company has entered into a license agreement with the Adviser under which the Adviser has agreed to grant the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Investcorp. Under this agreement, the Company has a right to use the Investcorp name for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains the Company s investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company has no legal right to the Investcorp name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser is in effect and Investcorp is the majority owner of the Adviser.

The figures in the above table are estimates based on the Company s year-to-date activity. The tax status of distributions for a tax year depends on the Company s total amount of taxable income for the entire year, therefore, the tax status cannot be confirmed until after the end of the tax year. Accordingly, the Company s distributions for the tax year may be re-characterized later based upon subsequent events. As applicable, the Company reports the actual tax character of its distributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes annually to stockholders on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-DIV issued after the end of the year. The Company s Form 10-K for the year ending June 30, 2024 will also include information regarding the actual components and tax treatment of all the Company s distributions for the fiscal year 2024. Because each stockholder s tax status is unique, stockholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this distribution notice.

Total return is calculated based on a time-weighted rate of return methodology for the stockholders and is not annualized. Total return is reflected after all investment-related and operating expenses. An individual stockholder s return may vary from these returns based on the timing of capital transactions. The ratios to average stockholders capital are calculated based on the monthly average stockholders capital during the period.

 Overview 
 Investcorp Credit Management BDC, Inc. ICMB, the Company , us , we or our ), a Maryland corporation formed in May 2013, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated and intend to continue to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. On August 30, 2019, we changed our name from CM Finance Inc. to Investcorp Credit Management BDC, Inc. 
 Our primary investment objective is to maximize total return to stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by investing directly in debt and related equity of privately held middle market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of standalone first and second lien loans, unitranche loans and mezzanine loans. We may also invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments. 
 CM Investment Partners LLC (the Adviser serves as our investment adviser. On August 30, 2019, Investcorp Credit Management US LLC Investcorp acquired an approximate 76 ownership interest in the Adviser through the acquisition of the interests held by Stifel Venture Corp. Stifel and certain funds managed by Cyrus Capital and through a direct purchase of equity from the Adviser. Investcorp is a leading global credit investment platform with assets under management of 22.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. Investcorp manages funds which invest primarily in senior secured corporate debt issued by mid and large-cap corporations in Western Europe and the United States. The business has a strong track record of consistent performance and growth, employing approximately 45 investment professionals in London and New York. Investcorp is a subsidiary of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. Investcorp Holdings ). Investcorp Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Investcorp, are referred to as Investcorp Group . Investcorp Group is a global provider and manager of alternative investments, offering such investments to its high-net-worth private and institutional clients on a global basis. 
 We have entered into an investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with the Adviser, pursuant to which the Adviser provides us with investment advisory and the administrative services necessary for our operations. See Note 7. Agreements and Related Party Transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement and the fees and expenses paid or reimbursed by us thereunder. 
 From time to time, we may form taxable subsidiaries (the Taxable Subsidiaries ), which are taxed as corporations for federal income tax purposes, to allow the Company to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements applicable to a RIC under the Code. As of each of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, we had no Taxable Subsidiaries. 
 We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. 
 On July 20, 2021, the SEC issued an order, which superseded a prior order issued on March 19, 2019, granting our application for exemptive relief to co-invest, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, in certain private placement transactions with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates and any future funds that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliated investment advisers (the Exemptive Relief ). Under the terms of the Exemptive Relief, in order for us to participate in a co-investment transaction a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must conclude that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, and (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies. 
 Market Developments 
 The current inflationary environment and uncertainty as to the probability of, and length and depth of a global recession could affect our portfolio companies. Government spending, government policies, including recent increases in certain interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other global central banks, the failures of certain regional banks earlier this year and the potential for disruptions in the availability of credit in the United States and elsewhere, in conjunction with other factors, including those described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in other filings we have made with the SEC, could affect our portfolio companies, our financial condition and our results of operations. We will continue to monitor the evolving market environment. In these circumstances, 
 35 

developments outside our control could require us to adjust our plan of operations and could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Despite these factors, we believe we and our portfolio are well positioned to manage the current environment. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors listed in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Critical accounting estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management s judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. We have identified the valuation of our portfolio investments, including our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by our board of directors), as our critical accounting policy and estimates. The critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with our risk factors in our Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of portfolio investments 
 We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies adopted by our board of directors. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (a) are independent of us, (b) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (c) are able to transact for the asset, and (d) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so). 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair value. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker dealers or market makers. 
 Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Because a readily available market value for many of the investments in our portfolio is often not available, we value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may also be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a particular security causes current market quotations not to reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently, causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a forced sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid ask spread. 
 Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or 
 36 

liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the members of the Adviser s investment team responsible for the portfolio investment; 

preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed by senior management and the Adviser; 

on a periodic basis, at least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; 

the valuation committee of our board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations and makes a recommendation to our board of directors regarding the fair value of each investment; and 

the board of directors then reviews and discusses these preliminary valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser, the independent valuation firm and the valuation committee. 

When valuing all of our investments, we strive to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances. The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a variety of factors. To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. As markets change, new types of investments are made, or pricing for certain investments becomes more or less observable, management, with oversight from our board of directors, may refine our valuation methodologies to best reflect the fair value of our investments appropriately. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio, valued at fair value in accordance with our Board-approved valuation policy, represented 92.5 of our total assets, as compared to 95.0 of our total assets as of June 30, 2023. 
 See Note 2.i Significant Accounting Policies Investment Valuation and Note 4. Investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our valuation process. 
 Financing Facility 
 On August 23, 2021, we, through Investcorp Credit Management BDC SPV, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a five-year, 115 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Capital One Revolving Financing with Capital One, N.A. Capital One ), which is secured by collateral consisting primarily of loans in our investment portfolio. On June 14, 2023, we amended the Capital One Revolving Financing to decrease the facility size from 115 million to 100 million. The Capital One Revolving Financing, which will expire on August 23, 2026 (the Maturity Date ), features a three-year reinvestment period and a two-year amortization period. 
 Effective November 18, 2022, borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 2.50 . The default interest rate will be equal to the interest rate then in effect plus 2.00 . The Capital One Revolving Financing required the payment of an upfront fee of 1.125 1.3 million) of the available borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing at the closing, and requires the payment of an unused fee of (i) 0.75 annually for any undrawn amounts below 50 of the Capital One Revolving Financing, (ii) 0.50 annually for any undrawn amounts between 50 and 75 of the Capital One Revolving Financing, and (iii) 0.25 annually for any undrawn amounts above 75 of the Capital One Revolving Financing. Borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing are based on a borrowing base. 
 37 

The Capital One Revolving Financing generally requires payment of interest and fees on a quarterly basis. All outstanding principal is due on the Maturity Date. The Capital One Revolving Financing also requires mandatory prepayment of interest and principal upon certain events. 
 As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, there were 70.0 million and 71.9 million in borrowings outstanding under the Capital One Revolving Financing, respectively. 
 For more information, see "Recent Developments." 
 Notes due 2026 
 On March 31, 2021, we closed the public offering of 65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875 notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes ). The total net proceeds to us from the 2026 Notes after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 1.3 million and offering expenses of approximately 215,000, were approximately 63.1 million. 
 The 2026 Notes will mature on April 1, 2026, unless previously redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms, and bear interest at a rate of 4.875 . The 2026 Notes are our direct unsecured obligations and rank pari passu , which means equal in right of payment, with all of our outstanding and future unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Because the 2026 Notes are not secured by any of our assets, they are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured as to which we subsequently grant a security interest), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 2026 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our existing or future subsidiaries and financing vehicles, including, without limitation, borrowings under the Capital One Revolving Financing. The 2026 Notes are exclusively our obligations and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the 2026 Notes and the 2026 Notes will not be required to be guaranteed by any subsidiary we may acquire or create in the future. 
 The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option, upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days written notice by mail prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof, at a redemption price (as determined by us) equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date: (1) 100 of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption) on the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the 2026 Notes Indenture (as defined below)) plus 50 basis points; provided, however, that if we redeem any 2026 Notes on or after January 1, 2026 (the date falling three months prior to the maturity date of the 2026 Notes), the redemption price for the 2026 Notes will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided, further, that no such partial redemption shall reduce the portion of the principal amount of a 2026 Note not redeemed to less than 2,000. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing October 1, 2021. We may from time to time repurchase 2026 Notes in accordance with the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the 2026 Notes was approximately 65.0 million. 
 The indenture under which the 2026 Notes are issued (the 2026 Notes Indenture contains certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to comply with Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(2) of 1940 Act, or any successor provisions, to comply with Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, or any successor provisions but giving effect to any no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC and upon which we may reasonably rely (or to us if we determine to seek such similar no-action or other relief), and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2026 Notes and the trustee if we should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are set forth in the 2026 Notes Indenture. 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount we have available to invest as well as the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies, companies whose securities are 
 38 

not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than 250 million. In each case, the company must be organized in the United States. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 2.19 of our total assets were non-qualifying assets. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from royalty income, dividends on our equity interests and capital gains on the sale of warrants and other debt or equity interests that we acquire. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the base management fee (the Base Management Fee and, depending on our operating results, the incentive fees (the Incentive Fee under the Advisory Agreement, as well as the payment of reimbursable expenses to the Adviser for the costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement, such as our allocable portion of overhead expenses, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Base Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensation under the Advisory Agreement remunerates the Adviser for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those relating to: 
 our organization and our offering; 

valuing our assets and calculating our net asset value per share (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm(s)); 

fees and expenses incurred by the Adviser or payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts; 

offerings of our common stock and other securities; 

administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including our allocable portion of the Adviser s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, equipment and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and his staffs compensation and compensation-related expenses); 

transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; 

federal and state registration fees; 

costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange; 

federal, state and local taxes; 

independent directors fees and expenses; 

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators; 

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders including printing costs; 

costs associated with individual or group stockholders; 

39 

our allocable portion of the costs and fees associated with any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs; and 

all other non-investment advisory expenses incurred by us or the Adviser in connection with administering our business. 

Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 Portfolio composition 
 We invest primarily in middle-market companies in the form of standalone first and second lien loans, unitranche loans and mezzanine loans. We may also invest in unsecured debt, bonds and in the equity of portfolio companies through warrants and other instruments. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio of 207.4 million (at fair value) consisted of debt and equity investments in 44 portfolio companies, of which 84.97 were first lien investments and 15.03 were in equities, warrants and other positions. At December 31, 2023, our average and largest portfolio company investment at fair value was 4.7 million and 14.5 million, respectively. 
 As of June 30, 2023, our investment portfolio of 220.1 million (at fair value) consisted of debt and equity investments in 36 portfolio companies, of which 89.21 were first lien investments and 10.79 were in equities, warrants and other positions. At June 30, 2023, our average and largest portfolio company investment at fair value was 6.1 million and 13.0 million, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, our weighted average total yield of debt and income producing securities at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 11.60 and 12.46 respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, our weighted average total yield on investments at amortized cost (which includes interest income and amortization of fees and discounts) was 10.07 and 11.32 , respectively. The weighted average total yield was computed using an internal rate of return calculation of our debt investments based on contractual cash flows, including interest and amortization payments, and, for floating rate investments, the spot SOFR, as applicable, as of December 31, 2023 of all of our debt investments. The weighted average total yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before payment of all of our fees and expenses, including any sales load paid in connection with an offering of our securities. There can be no assurance that the weighted average total yield will remain at its current level. 
 40 

We use Global Industry Classification Standard GICS codes to identify the industry groupings of our portfolio companies. At December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, the industry composition of our portfolio in accordance with the GICS codes at fair value, as a percentage of our total portfolio, was as follows:

During the six months ended December 31, 2023, we made investments in nine new portfolio companies and two existing portfolio companies totaling approximately 33.6 million, at cost. Of the new investments, 88.01 consisted of first lien investments and 11.99 of equity investments. 
 At December 31, 2023, 99.6 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates based on indices such as SOFR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds Rate of the Prime Rate (in certain cases, subject to interest rate floors), and 0.4 bore interest at fixed rates. At June 30, 2023, 99.6 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates based on indices such as LIBOR, SOFR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate (in certain cases, subject to interest rate floors), and 0.4 bore interest at fixed rates. 
 Our investment portfolio may contain loans that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we had five investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of 2.7 million, and as of June 30, 2023, we had nine investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of 5.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had sufficient liquidity (through cash on hand and available borrowings under our Capital One Revolving Financing) to fund such unfunded loan commitments should the need arise. 
 Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, we use the Adviser s investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric rating scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

Investment Rating 1 
 Investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. 

Investment Rating 2 
 Investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. Generally, all new loans are initially rated 2 . 

Investment Rating 3 
 Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with their financial covenants. 

41 

Investment Rating 4 
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in workout. Investments with a rating of 4 will be those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. 

Investment Rating 5 
 Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in workout. Investments with a rating of 5 will be those for which some loss of return and principal is expected. 

If the Adviser determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, the Adviser will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions. While the investment rating system identifies the relative risk for each investment, the rating alone does not dictate the scope and/or frequency of any monitoring that will be performed. The frequency of the Adviser s monitoring of an investment will be determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing the investment. 
 The following table shows the investment rankings of the investments in our portfolio, according to the Adviser s investment rating system:

Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the three months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 
 Investment income 
 Investment income, attributable primarily to interest and fees on our debt investments, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased to 6.2 million from 6.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to a decrease in interest income related to the repayment of four portfolio companies and a decrease in interest income related to the portfolio companies on non-accrual status, partially offset by an increase in PIK interest income earned on Crafty Apes, LLC due to its removal from non-accrual status during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased to 4.8 million, compared to 4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in base management fees, a decrease in the allocation of administrative costs from the Adviser, a decrease in amortization of deferred debt issuance costs due to the extension of the Capital One Revolving Financing maturity date to August 23, 2026, and the write-off of deferred income-based incentive fees, partially offset by an increase in interest expense with the Capital One Revolving Financing associated with borrowing activities, an increase in the provision for tax expense, and an increase in professional fees. 
 Net investment income 
 Net investment income decreased to 1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from 2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in total investment income primarily related to the repayment of four portfolio companies and a decrease in interest income related to the portfolio companies on non-accrual status, partially offset by an increase in PIK interest income earned on Crafty Apes, LLC due to its removal from non-accrual status during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, an increase in interest expense with the Capital One Revolving Financing associated with borrowing activities, an increase in the provision for tax expense, and an increase in professional fees. 
 Net realized gain or loss 
 There was a net realized loss from investments of 5.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the realization of losses from restructurings and loan modifications of our investments in American Nuts Holdings, LLC, 
 42 

Arborworks Acquisition LLC, ArborWorks, LLC, Crafty Apes, LLC, and Xenon Arc, Inc. There was no net realized gain or loss on investments for the three months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net change in unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments 
 We recorded a net change in unrealized appreciation of 1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the realization of previously unrealized losses resulting from the restructurings and loan modifications of our investments in American Nuts Holdings, LLC, Arborworks Acquisition LLC, ArborWorks, LLC, Crafty Apes, LLC, and Xenon Arc, Inc., mainly offset by the write down of our investments in Techniplas Foreign Holdco LP. 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation of 1.7 million, primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our investments in CareerBuilder, LLC, Fusion Connect, Inc Series A Preferred, and Klein Hersh, LLC which was offset by the increase in the value of our investments in the 4L Technologies, Inc Preferred Stock and Work Genius Holdings, Inc Equity Interest. 
 Comparison of the six months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 
 Investment income 
 Investment income, attributable primarily to interest and fees on our debt investments, for the six months ended December 31, 2023 decreased to 12.1 million from 13.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to a decrease in interest income related to the repayment of four portfolio companies, a decrease in interest income related to the portfolio companies on non-accrual status, and decreases in dividend income and other fee income, primarily offset by an increase in PIK interest income earned on Crafty Apes, LLC due to its removal from non-accrual status during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
 Expenses 
 Total expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased to 9.1 million, compared to 8.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest expense with the Capital One Revolving Financing associated with borrowing activities, partially offset by a decrease in base management fees and a decrease in the allocation of administrative costs from the Adviser. 
 Net investment income 
 Net investment income decreased to 3.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 from 4.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in total investment income primarily related to a decrease in interest income related to the repayment of four portfolio companies and a decrease in interest income related to the portfolio companies on non-accrual status, a decrease in base management fees, and a decrease in the allocation of administrative costs from the Adviser, partially offset by an increase in interest expense with the Capital One Revolving Financing associated with borrowing activities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary liquidity needs include interest and principal repayments under the Capital One Revolving Financing, interest payments on the 2026 Notes, our unfunded loan commitments (if any), investments in portfolio companies, dividend distributions to our stockholders and operating expenses. We believe that our current cash on hand and our anticipated cash flows from operations, including from contractual monthly portfolio company payments and prepayments, will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations. This Liquidity and Capital Resources section should be read in conjunction with Market Developments above and the risk factors referenced in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Cash flows 
 For the six months ended December 31, 2023, our total cash balance increased by 5.5 million. During that period, cash increased by 12.2 million from operating activities, primarily due to proceeds from sales and repayments of portfolio companies of 42.1 million and payables for investments purchased of 3.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in net assets resulting from operations of 4.6 million and payments for the purchase of investments in portfolio companies of 35.3 million. During the same period, net cash used in financing activities totaled 6.6 million, consisting primarily of 4.7 million of distributions paid to our stockholders and repayments of 30.0 million to paydown the Capital One Revolving Facility, offset by proceeds of 28.1 million from borrowing under the Capital One Revolving Facility. 
 Capital resources 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 3.1 million of cash as well as 11.6 million in restricted cash and 30.0 million of capacity under the Capital One Revolving Financing. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of equity and/or debt securities, future borrowings or debt issuances, as well as cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies and, to a lesser extent, from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. 
 As discussed below in further detail, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we generally must distribute substantially all of our net taxable income to stockholders in the form of dividends. Our net taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Asset Coverage Requirements 
 On May 2, 2018, our board of directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the board of directors, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, effective May 2, 2019, our applicable minimum asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act was decreased to 150 from 200 . Thus, we are permitted under the 1940 Act, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2023, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 158.4 . 
 Regulated Investment Company Status and Distributions 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. If we continue to qualify as a RIC for a taxable year, we will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to stockholders on a timely basis. 
 Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of capital. 
 To continue to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90 of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any). We will also be subject to a federal excise tax, based on distributive requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis. 
 We intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90 and 100 of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, the covenants contained in the Capital One Revolving Financing and any other borrowing or 
 44 

financing arrangement we or our subsidiaries may have may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year, a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in the agreements governing our borrowing or financial arrangements. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level. 
 In accordance with certain applicable U.S. Department of Treasury Treasury regulations and a revenue procedure issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder elects to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20 of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20 of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or private letter rulings. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2023, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of 2.7 million in unfunded commitments to five of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2023, we had sufficient liquidity (through cash on hand and available borrowings under our Capital One Revolving Financing) to fund such unfunded loan commitments should the need arise. As of June 30, 2023, our off-balance arrangements consisted of 5.7 million in unfunded commitments to nine of our portfolio companies. 
 Recent Developments 
 From January 1, 2024 through February 16, 2024, we made advances of approximately 0.4 million on one existing revolving credit commitment to one portfolio company and received approximately 4.7 million from the repayment of two positions for one portfolio company. 
 On February 8, 2024, our board of directors declared a distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 of 0.12 per share payable on April 5, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024 and a supplemental distribution of 0.03 per share, payable on April 5, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. 
 On January 17, 2024, we, through SPV LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a fourth amendment (the Fourth Amendment to the Capital One Revolving Financing. The Fourth Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) the extension of the maturity date to January 17, 2029, (ii) an increase of the applicable interest spreads under the Capital One Revolving Financing and (iii) the extension of the Scheduled Revolving Period End Date (as defined in Capital One Revolving Financing) to January 17, 2027. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Generally, we believe higher yielding assets such as those in our investment portfolio do not necessarily follow a linear interest rate relationship and are less sensitive in price-to-interest rate changes than many other debt investments. Our investments in 
 45 

fixed-rate assets are generally exposed to changes in value due to interest rate fluctuations, and our floating-rate assets are generally exposed to cash-flow variability from fluctuation in rates. At December 31, 2023, 99.6 of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to three months. 
 Consequently, our net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is exposed to risks related to interest-rate fluctuations. Variable-rate instruments subject to a floor generally reset periodically to the applicable floor and, in the case of investments in our portfolio, quarterly to a floor based on SOFR, only if the index exceeds the floor. As of December 31, 2023, 100.0 of our floating-rate portfolio was subject to interest-rate floors set at or below the current applicable rate. Under these loans, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. In addition, our interest expense will be affected by changes in the published interest rates in connection with the Capital One Revolving Financing to the extent it goes above the floor; however, our 2026 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2023, our floating rate borrowings totaled 70.0 million in principal amount, which represented 51.9 of our outstanding debt. 
 Based on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023, with certain interest rate floors and our financing arrangements at December 31, 2023, a 1.00 increase in interest rates would increase our net interest income by approximately 8.48 and a 2.00 increase in interest rates would increase our net interest income by approximately 16.95 . 
 Although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity as of December 31, 2023, to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit markets, the size, credit quality or composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowing, that could affect the net increase in net assets resulting from operations or net income. It also does not adjust for the effect of the time lag between a change in the relevant interest rate index and the rate adjustment under the applicable loans or borrowings. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis included herein. 
 Because it is our intention to hold loans to maturity, the fluctuating relative value of these loans that may occur due to changes in interest rates may have an impact on unrealized gains and losses during quarterly reporting periods. Based on our assessment of the interest rate risk, as of December 31, 2023, we had no hedging transactions in place as we deemed the risk acceptable, and we did not believe it was necessary to mitigate this risk at that time. 
 46 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of December 31, 2023 (the end of the period covered by this report), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely identifying the incorrect accrual of certain expenses in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, approximately 388,000, or approximately 0.02 per share, of adjustments relating to the incorrect accrual of certain expenses were identified, of which approximately 356,000 of adjustments related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The Company believes these errors were immaterial in nature and has corrected such errors in the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, our independent registered public accounting firm advised us that such delayed detection of the errors resulted in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Management has taken, and will continue to take, significant and comprehensive action to remediate the internal control weakness. In this regard, we have added or are in the process of adding five accounting personnel and are hiring a third-party service provider to provide support for our day-to-day finance and accounting activities to, among other things, create additional redundancies in duties surrounding the Company s accrual of expenses and the frequency of the review thereof. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than as noted above, management did not identify any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 47 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Neither we, the Adviser, nor our subsidiaries, nor any of our respective property, are currently subject to any material legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses. We, the Adviser, and our subsidiaries may from time to time, however, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance whether any current or future legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.
