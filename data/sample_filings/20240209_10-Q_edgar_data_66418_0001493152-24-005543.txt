Operations MD A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ). Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, beliefs or current expectations and may be signified

While
we have made assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the assumptions that support our forward-looking statements are based upon information
that is currently available and is subject to change. All forward-looking statements in the Form 10-Q are qualified in their entirety
by the cautionary statement contained in this section. We do not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information.
It is suggested that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Form 10-K. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. Historically, we have funded our operations, acquisitions, exploration and development expenditures from cash
generated by operating activities, bank borrowings, sales of non-core properties and issuance of common stock. Our primary financial
resource is our base of oil and gas reserves. We have pledged our producing oil and gas properties to secure our credit facility. We
do not have any delivery commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of its oil and gas under any existing contract or agreement. 

Our
long-term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low cost operations by acquiring and
developing oil and gas properties with potential for long-lived production. We focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties and
working interests in non-operated properties in areas with significant development potential. 

At
December 31, 2023, we had working capital of 4,297,176 compared to working capital of 3,475,776 at March 31, 2023, an increase of 821,400
for the reasons set forth below. 

Cash
Flows 

Changes
in the net funds provided by or (used in) each of our operating, investing and financing activities are set forth in the table below:

Cash
Flow Provided by Operating Activities. Cash flow from operating activities is primarily derived from the production of our crude
oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the balances of non-cash accounts, receivables, payables or other non-energy property asset
account balances. Cash flow provided by our operating activities for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 was 3,374,717 in comparison
to 4,350,920 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This decrease of 976,203 in our cash flow operating activities consisted
of an increase in our non-cash expenses of 384,803; a decrease in our accounts receivable of 1,192,691; an increase of 113,278 of
our accounts payable and accrued expenses; and, a decrease in our net income for the current nine months of 2,674,516. Variations in
cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures. 

Our
expenditures in operating activities consist primarily of drilling expenses, production expenses and engineering services. Our expenses
also consist of employee compensation, accounting, insurance and other general and administrative expenses that we have incurred in order
to address normal and necessary business activities of a public company in the crude oil and natural gas production industry.

We
are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate. The cost of such projects would be funded,
to the extent possible, from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations. The remainder may be funded through borrowings on
the credit facility and, if appropriate, sales of non-core properties. 

Crude
oil and natural gas generally remained volatile during the last year. The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult
to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX West Texas
Intermediate WTI posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of 62.72 per bbl in March 2023 to a high of 89.66
per bbl in September 2023. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price Henry Hub posted price for natural gas has ranged from a low
of 1.74 per MMBtu in June 2023 to a high of 3.78 per MMBtu in January 2023. 

On
December 31, 2023, the WTI posted price for crude oil was 67.63 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was 2.58. See Results
of Operations below for realized price. 

Contractual
Obligations. We have no off-balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. The

Results
of Operations Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, there was net income
of 345,610 compared to 1,244,785 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 as a result of a decrease in operating revenues due to a decrease
in oil and gas prices and production partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses that is further explained below. 

Oil
and gas sales . Revenue from oil and gas sales was 1,610,595 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a 35 decrease from 2,486,017
for the same period of fiscal 2023. This resulted from a decrease in oil and natural gas production volumes and a decrease in oil and
natural gas prices.

Production
and exploration. Production costs were 401,035 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a 16 decrease from 478,670 for the same period
of fiscal 2023. This is primarily the result of a decrease in production taxes and marketing charges as a result of the decrease in oil
and gas revenues. 

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was 400,337 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a
19 decrease from 496,509 for the same period of fiscal 2023, primarily due to a decrease in production and full cost pool amortization
base. 

General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 335,153 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a 16 increase
from 288,536 for the same period of fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to an increase in accounting fees and employee stock option
compensation. 

Income
taxes. Federal income tax for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was 169,986. There was no federal income tax expense for
the three months ended December 31, 2022 because the Company was in a net deferred tax asset position. State income tax was 32,959 for
the three months ended December 31, 2023, a 47 decrease from 61,986 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the decrease
in oil and natural gas sales in the State of New Mexico. The effective tax rate for state and federal taxes combined for the three months
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 37 and 5 , respectively. The increase in the effective federal tax rate is the result of the reconciliation
to the federal tax return. 

Results
of Operations Nine Months Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, there was a net
income of 1,080,657 compared to net income of 3,755,173 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This was a result of a decrease
in operating revenues due to a decrease in oil and gas prices and a decrease in gas production partially offset by an increase in oil
production and a decrease in operating expenses that is further explained below. 

Oil
and gas sales . Revenue from oil and gas sales was 4,706,395 for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, a 35 decrease from 7,184,025
for the same period of fiscal 2023. This resulted from a decrease in oil and natural gas prices and a decrease in natural gas production
partially offset by an increase in oil production.

Production
and exploration. Production costs were 1,143,116 for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, a 13 decrease from 1,308,143 for
the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in production taxes and marketing charges
as a result of the decrease in oil and gas revenues. 

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was 1,268,703 for the nine months ended December 31,
2023, a .1 increase from 1,268,016 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, due to a decrease in oil and gas reserves and an increase
in oil production partially offset by a decrease in gas production and the full cost amortization base. 

General
and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 981,665 for the nine months ended December 31, 2023, a 12 
increase from 876,735 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to an increase in employee stock option compensation,
accounting fees and engineering services partially offset by a decrease in legal fees. 

Income
taxes. Federal income tax for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 was 319,848. There was no federal income tax expense for the
nine months ended December 31, 2022 because the Company was in a net deferred tax asset position. State income tax was 79,123 for the
nine months ended December 31, 2023, a 31 decrease from 115,236 for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 due to the decrease in
oil and natural gas sales in the State of New Mexico. The effective tax rate for state and federal taxes combined for the nine months
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 27 and 3 , respectively. The increase in the effective federal tax rate is the result of the reconciliation
to the federal tax return. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The
primary sources of market risk for us include fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. All of our financial instruments are
for purposes other than trading. 

Credit
Risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations. Our primary
credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized. At
December 31, 2023, our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was 565,161 or 62 of our total oil and gas receivables.
We have not experienced any significant credit losses. 

Energy
Price Risk. Our most significant market risk is the pricing applicable to our crude oil and natural gas production. Our financial
condition, results of operations, and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil
and natural gas. Prices for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this
volatility to continue in the future. 

Factors
that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products, foreign and domestic supply of oil and gas,
the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil-exporting countries, weather conditions, the price and availability
of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing and consuming countries. 

For
example, in the last twelve months, the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate WTI posted price for crude oil has ranged from
a low of 62.72 per bbl in March 2023 to a high of 89.66 per bbl in September 2023. The Henry Hub Spot Market Price Henry Hub posted price for natural gas has ranged from a low of 1.74 per MMBtu in June 2023 to a high of 3.78 per MMBtu in January 2023. On December
31, 2023, the WTI posted price for crude oil was 67.63 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was 2.58. See Results of Operations
above for the Company s realized prices during the three and nine months. Subsequently, on January 30, 2024, the WTI posted price
for crude oil was 73.80 and the Henry Hub posted price for natural gas was 2.26. 

Declines
in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating
results. Changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves. Any reduction
in reserves, including reductions due to price fluctuations, can reduce the borrowing base under our credit facility and adversely affect
the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our acquisition, exploration
and development activities. In addition, a noncash write-down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting
rules if prices declined significantly, even if it is only for a short period of time. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of crude
oil and natural gas that can be produced economically. Thus, we may experience material increases or decreases in reserve quantities
solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance. 

Similarly,
any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.
If the average oil price had increased or decreased by ten dollars per barrel for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our operating
revenues would have increased or decreased 508,260. If the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for the
first nine months of fiscal 2024, our operating revenues would have increased or decreased 372,459. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information we must disclose
