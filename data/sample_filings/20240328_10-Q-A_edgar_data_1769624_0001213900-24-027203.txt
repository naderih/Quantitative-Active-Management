million (equivalent to approximately GBP million) and fully received in September 2021,
resulting in a realized gain of approximately million (equivalent to approximately GBP million). As of December 31, 2021, the
Company recorded an income tax payable of million based on the Hong Kong profit tax rate of . 

The Company corrected its previous
conclusion of provision of income tax liabilities of million related to the disposal of Nutmeg. The Company had previously
believed that the gain from the sale of Nutmeg should have been taxed at the profit tax rate in Hong Kong during the year of
disposal, resulting in a recorded income tax liability of million. After reassessing whether income tax should be provided, the
Company reviewed that there was an error resulting from the improper application of US tax law and Hong Kong tax law due to the
mistaken omission of the consideration of Hong Kong tax law, and came to the conclusion that there should be
no income tax applied when selling a long-term investment in Hong Kong. 

The impact of restatement 

The impact of the accounting errors was a
cumulative reduction in the income tax provision of million and a cumulative decrease in the accumulated deficit of million,
and it had no impact on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s
ability to successfully implement its plans. The Company believes that it will be able to continue to grow the Company s revenue
base and control expenditures. In parallel, the Company continually monitors its capital structure and operating plans and evaluates various
potential funding alternatives that may be needed in order to finance the Company s business development activities, general and
administrative expenses and growth strategy. These alternatives include external borrowings, raising funds through public equity or debt
markets. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with its fundraising initiatives. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

in certain bank accounts on behalf of the Company s customers and (ii) million (2022: million) was held in an escrow
account in connection with the Meteora Backstop Agreement. 

For the funds held on behalf of the customers,
the Company is acted as a custodian to manage the assets and investment portfolio on behalf of its customers under the terms of certain
contractual agreements, which the Company does not have the right to use for any purposes, other than managing the portfolio. Upon receiving
escrow funds, the Company records a corresponding escrow liability. 

Pursuant to the Meteora Backstop Agreement, the
fund held in the escrow account for the forward share purchase is restricted to the Company for the nine months following the consummation
of the Business Combination in November 2022, unless the investors sells the shares in the market or redeems the shares. Notwithstanding
the sale of shares by the investors, the restricted cash will be used to settle any of the Company s repurchase obligations.

The accounts receivable due from related parties

a compensation of asset management service fee income at the predetermined rate based on the respective portfolio of asset values invested
by the final customers. The amount is unsecured, interest-free, mutually agreed. 

The Company generally conducts its business with
creditworthy third parties. The Company determines, on a quarterly basis, the probable losses and an allowance for credit losses determined
in accordance with the CECL model, based on historical losses, current economic conditions, forecasted future economic and market considerations,
and in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. Accounts receivable are written off after exhaustive collection
efforts occur and the receivable is deemed uncollectible. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and its exposure
to bad debts is not significant. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and

of specific evidence indicating doubtful collection, historical loss experience, loan balance aging and prevailing economic conditions.
If there is an unexpected deterioration of a customer s financial condition or an unexpected change in economic conditions, including
macroeconomic events, the Company will assess the need to adjust the allowance for credit losses. Any such resulting adjustments would

Investments
in Non-Marketable Equity Securities 

Investments in non-marketable equity securities
consist of investments in limited liability companies in which the Company s interests are deemed minor and long-term, strategic
investments in companies that are in various stages of development, and investments in a close-ended partnership funds which concentrated
in the healthcare sector. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values and, therefore, are reported at cost, minus impairment,
if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment
of the same issuer. 

Management assesses each of these investments
on an individual basis, subject to a periodic impairment review and considers qualitative and quantitative factors including the investee s
financial condition, the business outlook for its products and technology, its projected results and cash flow, financing transactions
subsequent to the acquisition of the investment, the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and cash usage. When an impairment
exists, the investment will be written down to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense),
net. Fair value is estimated using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.

per full share, subject to adjustment as discussed herein. The warrants
became exercisable days after the Closing of the Business Combination and will expire after the Closing of the Business
Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant
holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares. This means that only an even number of warrants may be exercised at
any given time by a warrant holder. 

If the Company calls the warrants for redemption
as described above, the management of the Company will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so
on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that
number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants,
multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y)
the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for
the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.
Whether the Company will exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis will
depend on a variety of factors including the price of our ordinary shares at the time the warrants are called for redemption, the Company s
cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive share issuances. 

Private
Warrants 

The private warrants are identical to the public
warrants, except that the private warrants and the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the private warrants were not transferable,
assignable or salable until after the completion of the Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the
private warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers
or their permitted transferees. If the private warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees,
the private warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the public warrants. 

The private warrants are accounted as liabilities,

related party transactions during the periods presented. 

Customer B 

Customer C 

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, there
was no single customer who accounted for 10 or more of the Company s revenues. 

All of the Company s major customers are
located in Hong Kong. 

(b) Credit risk 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit
risk consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, loans receivables, and notes receivables. Cash equivalents are
maintained with high credit quality institutions, the composition and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. The Hong
Kong Deposit Protection Board pays compensation up to a limit of HK (approximately if the bank with which an individual/a
company hold its eligible deposit fails. As of March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of million and fund held in escrow of 
million were maintained at financial institutions in Hong Kong, of which approximately million was subject to credit risk. While
management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness. 

For accounts receivable, loans receivables, and notes receivables,
the Company determines, on a continuing basis, the probable losses and sets up an allowance for doubtful accounts and loan losses based
on the estimated realizable value. Credit of money lending business is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring
procedures.

Customer E

(c) Economic and political risk 

The Company s major operations are conducted
in Hong Kong. Accordingly, the political, economic, and legal environments in Hong Kong, as well as the general state of Hong Kong s
economy may influence the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

(d) Exchange rate risk 

The Company cannot guarantee that the current
exchange rate will remain steady; therefore there is a possibility that the Company could post the same amount of profit for two comparable
periods and because of the fluctuating exchange rate actually post higher or lower profit depending on exchange rate of HKD converted
to US and Sterling on that date. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in political and economic environments without
notice. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and
2022, the Company recorded the foreign exchange gain of and loss of , respectively, mainly attributable from the long-term
investments which are mostly denominated in Sterling. 

(e) Liquidity risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will
not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient cash
to meet its liabilities when they become due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Company s reputation. A key risk in managing liquidity is the degree of uncertainty in the cash flow projections.
If future cash flows are fairly uncertain, the liquidity risk increases.

30 

Distribution Business 

The Distribution Business comprises a variety
of captive financial services distribution channels. We have built a market leading financial advisors distribution channel in Hong Kong.
We have also built other distribution channels alongside our market leading financial advisors business. 

Our combined captive distribution channels enable
us to directly access one of the largest pools of customers accessible to independent financial services providers in Hong Kong. 

Channel 
 
 Description 
 
 Financial Advisors Business FA Business 
 
 Focus is engaged in the distribution of life insurance,
 asset management, property-casualty and Mandatory Provident Fund products through its teams of independent financial advisors (brokers). 

Alternative Distribution Business 
 
 A collection of distribution channels, including salaried financial
 planners targeting HNWI, development teams pursuing corporate partnerships and incubating financial advisors teams. 

Digital Business 
 
 AGBA Money is a direct-to-consumer digital app that provides various
 financial products and services to retail customers. 

Our largest distribution channel is the FA Business,
operating under the brand name Focus. With its large salesforce of financial advisors, Focus provides a wide range of financial
products and independent advisory services to individual and corporate customers, primarily in connection with life insurance products.
Our FA Business has been the clear market leader in the insurance brokerage industry in Hong Kong for decades, building up a large and
highly productive salesforce. As of March 31, 2023, there were around 1,600 financial advisors at Focus , organized into
32 sales teams. Each team is led by a tree head , responsible for managing the financial advisors within their teams. 

In addition to the FA Business, we continue to
expand our distribution footprint with the establishment and expansion of a number of additional distribution channels, collectively
known as our Alternative Distribution Business. These distribution channels are targeted at specific customer segments and/or capturing
specific distribution opportunities. 

Combined with our Digital Business, we now have
a well-diversified range of distribution channels and capabilities. 

During 2022, we continued to make significant
investments into developing and expanding our financial advisors salesforce, broadening and deepening the product range, as well as upgrading
the supporting infrastructure. Our infrastructure not only supports the financial consultants in engaging with their customers, it also
provides extensive operational support in relation to the processing of transactions, associated payment flows, as well as after-sales
services. Building our infrastructure required substantial investments into technological, operational and financial systems, as well
as the development of comprehensive operational and support teams (operations support, customer services, payments, etc.). Since many
of the financial products offered to our customers are regulated, on top of the various operational requirements, we have built significant
internal capabilities in the areas of risk and internal control, as well as legal and compliance to ensure an appropriate level of regulatory
compliance and supervision. 

As a result of our efforts to expand our distribution
capabilities and improve our supporting infrastructure, we have successfully developed these inter-related strategic assets: 

Vast customer base in Hong
Kong and growing customer base in Mainland China. 

State-of-the-art supporting
infrastructure. 

Relationships with and access
to a broad range of leading global financial product providers. 

Deep market knowledge and understanding. 

Highly productive and well-trained
salesforce. 

31 

We will continue to capitalize on these core
strategic assets and match them with the emerging opportunities in our three core industries (life insurance, wealth management and healthcare). 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the
Company made 9.7 million from commission in the Distribution Business. The revenue attributed to the Company during the first quarter
of 2023 only captured an insignificant portion of the revenues actually generated by the financial advisors currently associated with
Focus. 

Upon the re-opening of China Border, we will
continue to widen our distribution footprint and actively explore further opportunities to develop partnerships and generate customer
leads on the ground in Mainland China, as well as refining our abilities to service our customer base. We expect sales volumes to return
to the levels previously recorded, prior to the pandemic period, especially with the re-opening of the Mainland border and the ongoing
integration of Hong Kong into the Greater Bay area.

is a one-stop financial supermarket with a breadth of products and services that is unrivaled in Hong Kong sourced from leading global

complex healthcare challenges with reduced operating costs. We will focus on technology/digitalization and consumerization of healthcare
to create an ecosystem empowering customers to proactively manage their health and well-being and to improve their access to healthcare
at a lower cost with connectivity across the care continuum. We believe that JFA has the captive customer base, infrastructure
and product/service offerings to optimize customer experience to further grab market share. 

We are currently working to transform JFA into
the best medical care institution in Asia by 2025, redefining industry standards in the Greater Bay Area and offering market-leading
customer care and best-in-class infrastructure empowered by data analytics.

increased by US 4.9 million, or 544.93 , for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022.
The net increase was mainly due to the increase in legal and professional fees of US 0.7 million, management fee expense of US 1.7 million,
share-based compensation of 2.6 million, offset by a decrease in financial data subscription expense of US 0.04 million. Upon the consummation
of Business Combination, the post-combination entity has expensed more as a listed company, with a significant increase in the legal and
professional fees and management fee expense increased were primarily attributed to 1) the US legal counsel fee incurred and 2) the office
and administrative expenses pay to the shareholder for the use of office premises in Trust Tower and Hopewell Centre, including building
management fees, government rates and rent, office rent, lease-related interest, and depreciation actually incurred by the shareholder,
with the increased occupancy from business expansion. Share-based compensation in the first quarter of 2023, was mainly related to marketing
consultancy service rendered by a third party consultant, payable by 1,200,000 ordinary shares at the market price of 2.1575 per share.

Income tax benefit increased by US 0.4 million,
or 106.44 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily attributable to
the over provision of income tax for prior years.

Net Loss 

Net loss increased by US 11.6 million, or 2,600.89 
for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to March 31, 2022, due primarily to the increase in operating expenses of US 21.7
million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 

We have a history of operating losses and negative
cash flow. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we reported a net loss of US 12.1 million and reported a negative operating
cash flow of US 10.2 million. As of March 31, 2023, our cash balance was US 3.7 million for working capital use. Our management estimates
that currently available cash will not be able to provide sufficient funds to meet the planned obligations for the next 12 months starting
March 31, 2023. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern
is dependent on our ability to successfully implement our plans. Our management believes that it will be able to continue to grow our
revenue base and control expenditures. In parallel, AGBA continually monitors its capital structure and operating plans and evaluates
various potential funding alternatives that may be needed in order to finance our business development activities, general and administrative
expenses, and growth strategy. These alternatives include external borrowings, raising funds through public equity, or tapping debt markets.
Although there is no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to pursue these fundraising initiatives and have access to the capital
markets going forward. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements attached to this Form 10-Q/A do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Future Liquidity 

On a recurring basis, the primary future cash
needs of the Company will be focused on operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, investment, regulatory and compliance
costs. The ability of the Company to fund these needs will depend, in part, on its ability to generate or raise cash in the future, which
is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. 

The ability to fund our operating needs will
depend on its future ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations and raise capital in the capital markets. Our
management believe that we will meet known or reasonably likely future cash requirements through the combination of cash flows from operating
activities, available cash balances, and external borrowings and fund raising. Our management expects that the primary cash requirements
in 2023 will be to fund capital expenditures for (i) expansion of the Distribution Business and (ii) Platform Business. 

If our sources of liquidity need to be augmented,
additional cash requirements would likely need to be financed through the issuance of debt or equity securities; however, there can be
no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future. 

We expect that operating losses could continue
into the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in growing our businesses. Based upon our current operating plans, our management
believes that cash and equivalents will not be able to provide sufficient funds to its operations for at least the next 12 months from
the date of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements provided with this Form 10-Q/A. However, these forecasts involve
risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. 

Our future capital requirements may vary materially
from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenues growth, the timing and extent of spending
on sales and marketing, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of
our brand, and overall economic conditions. We may also seek additional capital to fund our operations, including through the sale of
equity or debt financings. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity, the ownership interest of
our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
the rights of our existing shareholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments
governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was US 10.2
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of US 1.3 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022. 

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March
31, 2023 was primarily the result of the net loss of US 12.1 million, an increase in accounts receivable of US 0.5 million, increase in
deposit, prepayments, and other receivables of US 0.5 million, decrease in escrow liabilities of US 0.02 million and decrease in income
tax payable of US 0.2 million. These amounts were partially offset by the decrease in loans receivables of US 0.1 million, increase in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities of US 1.2 million, and non-cash adjustments consisting of share-based compensation expense of
US 3.9 million, depreciation of property and equipment of US 0.1 million, net foreign exchange gain of US 0.6 million, net investment
income of US 1.7 million, and change in fair value of forward share purchase liability of US 0.08 million. 

Net cash provided by operating activities for
the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily the result of the net loss of US 0.4 million, a decrease in loans receivable of US 2.3
million, and an increase in escrow liabilities of US 1.7 million. These amounts were partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable
of US 0.04 million, deposits, prepayments, and other receivable of US 0.06 million, decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
of US 1.0 million, and non-cash adjustments consisting of unrealized investment income of US 2.1 million, net foreign exchange loss of
US 0.5 million, and depreciation of property and equipment of US 0.1 million. 

39 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 of US 4.0 million was primarily due to proceeds from sale of investments of US 4.0 million, dividend
received from long-term investments of US 0.6 million, offset by the purchase of notes receivable of US 0.6 million. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 of US 6.9 million was primarily due to proceeds from sale of investments of US 1.9 million, offset
by the purchase of property and equipment of US 0.9 million, and payment of earnest deposit of US 7.8 million for the purchase of an
office premise from the shareholder. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 of US 3.5 million was primarily due to advances from the shareholder of US 1.7 million and proceeds
from borrowings of US 1.8 million.. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the
three months ended March 31, 2022 of US 14.5 million was primarily due to advances from the shareholder of US 2.9 million, offset by
the dividend distribution of US 17.4 million to the shareholder. 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

Our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of
assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The management of the Company estimates that currently
available cash will not be able to provide sufficient funds to meet the Company s planned obligations for the next 12 months
from the date that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were made available to be issued. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2023,
we reported a net loss of approximately US 12.1 million. With a significant increase in our operating costs, described in the paragraph
below, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately US 28.5 million as of March 31, 2023. 

However, coupled with its business expansion,
we reported significant sales growth with total revenue of approximately US 11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (2022:
US 2.1 million), and resulted with an operating loss of approximately US 14.6 million (2022: US 1.9 million). We expect to continue our
business growth, while closely monitoring our future spending. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent on the management s ability to successfully implement its plans. Our management team believes that we will be able to
continue to grow our revenue base and control our expenditures. In parallel, our management team will continually monitor our capital
structure and operating plans and evaluate various potential funding alternatives that may be needed in order to finance our business
development activities, general and administrative expenses and growth strategy. 

We intend to raise additional capital through
private placements of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable,
or will be sufficient to enable us to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient
additional funds, we will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back our current
business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan
will be successful.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company 
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation and
supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, our disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter,
there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

The effectiveness of any system of internal control
over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing,
operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system
of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable,
not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but there can be no
assurance that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.
