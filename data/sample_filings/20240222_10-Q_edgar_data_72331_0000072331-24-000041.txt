 common shares were authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan plus the number of shares that remained available to be granted under the 2012 Plan, as well as issuable under the CyberOptics equity plan. As of January 31, 2024, a total of common shares were available to be granted under the 2021 Plan. 
 Stock Options 
 Nonqualified or incentive stock options may be granted to our employees and directors. Generally, options granted to employees may be exercised beginning one year from the date of grant at a rate not exceeding percent per year and expire years from the date of grant. Vesting accelerates upon a qualified termination in connection with a change in control. In the event of termination of employment due to early retirement or normal retirement at age , options granted within months prior to termination are forfeited, and vesting continues post retirement for all other unvested options granted. In the event of disability or death, all unvested stock options granted within months prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason results in forfeiture of unvested options and vested options in certain circumstances. The amortized cost of options is accelerated if the retirement eligibility date occurs before the normal vesting date. Option exercises are satisfied through the issuance of treasury shares on a first-in, first-out basis. We recognized compensation expense related to stock options of and for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The weighted-average expected volatility used to value the 2024 and 2023 options was and , respectively. 
 Historical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate was selected based upon yields of U.S. Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option being valued. 
 The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively.

 Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units 
 We may grant restricted shares and/or restricted share units to our employees and directors. These shares or units may not be transferred for a designated period of time (generally one to defined at the date of grant. We may also grant continuation awards in the form of restricted share units with cliff vesting and a performance measure that must be achieved for the restricted share units to vest. 
 For employee recipients, in the event of termination of employment due to early retirement, with the consent of the Company, restricted shares and units granted within months prior to termination are forfeited, and other restricted shares and units vest on a pro-rata basis, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of termination of employment due to normal retirement at age , restricted shares and units granted within months prior to termination are forfeited, and, for other restricted shares and units, the restriction period applicable to restricted shares will lapse and the shares will vest and be transferable and all unvested units will become vested in full, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of a recipient's disability or death, all restricted shares and units granted within months prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason prior to the lapse of any restrictions or vesting of units results in forfeiture of the shares or units. 
 For non-employee directors, all restrictions lapse in the event of disability or death of the non-employee director. Termination of service as a director for any other reason within one year of date of grant results in a pro-rata vesting of shares or units. 
 As shares or units are issued, stock-based compensation equivalent to the fair value on the date of grant is expensed over the vesting period. 
 As of January 31, 2024, there were unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted shares. The amount charged to expense related to restricted shares during the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively, which included common share dividends of and , respectively.

 Performance Share Incentive Awards 
 Executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive common share-based incentive awards. Payouts, in the form of unrestricted common shares, vary based on the degree to which corporate financial performance exceeds predetermined threshold, target and maximum performance goals over performance periods. No payout will occur unless threshold performance is achieved. 
 The amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. The calculations are based upon the grant date fair value, which is principally driven by the stock price on the date of grant. The per share values were in 2024, and , and for 2023. The amount charged to expense related to performance awards for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. As of January 31, 2024, there was of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance share incentive awards. 
 Deferred Compensation 
 Our executive officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to defer up to percent of their base pay and cash incentive compensation, and for executive officers, up to percent of their share-based performance incentive payout each year. Additional share units are credited for quarterly dividends paid on our common shares. Expense related to dividends paid under this plan for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. 
 Deferred Directors' Compensation 
 Non-employee directors may defer all or part of their cash and equity-based compensation until retirement. Cash compensation may be deferred as cash or as share equivalent units. Deferred cash amounts are recorded as liabilities, and share equivalent units are recorded as equity. Additional share equivalent units are earned when common share dividends are declared.

. The liability for environmental remediation represents management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations. The accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities, the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations, and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements. Consequently, our liability could be greater than our current estimate. However, we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Results of Operations 
 Three months ended January 31, 2024 
 Worldwide sales for the three months ended January 31, 2024, were 633,193, an increase of 3.7 from sales of 610,477 for the comparable period of 2023. The increase was driven by a 5.4 increase due to an acquisition and a favorable effect from currency translation of 0.5 . Organic sales decreased 2.2 driven by ongoing pressure in electronics product lines, partially offset by growth in medical interventional, industrial and polymer processing product lines. 
 In the Americas region, sales were 274,012 for the three months ended January 31, 2024, an increase of 3.4 from the comparable period of 2023, consisting of an organic sales decrease of 0.3 , an increase due to an acquisition of 3.1 , and favorable currency effects of 0.6 . In the Asia Pacific region, sales were 179,871, a decrease of 1.5 from the comparable period of 2023, consisting of an organic sales decrease of 0.5 and unfavorable currency effects of 1.7 , partially offset by a 0.7 increase due to an acquisition. In Europe, sales were 179,310, an increase of 10.0 from the comparable period of 2023, consisting of an organic sales decrease of 7.0 , favorable currency effects of 2.8 , and a 14.2 increase due to an acquisition. 
 Cost of sales for the three months ended January 31, 2024 were 284,766, up from 281,610 in the comparable period of 2023. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased to 55.0 from 53.9 in the comparable period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable mix. 
 Selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2024 were 188,992, up from 184,648 in the comparable period of 2023. The 2.4 increase was primarily driven by the first-year effect of an acquisition and related acquisition costs, partially offset by lower base business costs. 
 Operating profit increased to 159,435 for the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to 144,219 in the comparable period of 2023. Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 25.2 f or the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to 23.6 in the comparable period of 2023 . The 1.6 percentage-point increase in operating margin was primarily driven by the gross margin improvement . 
 Interest expense for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was 21,442, compared to 10,530 in the comparable period of 2023. The increase, compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to higher average debt levels, driven by acquisitions. Other expense was 338 compared to expense of 3,196 in the comparable period of 2023. Included in 2024 other expense were pension and postretirement income of 1,025 and 822 of foreign currency losses. Included in 2023 other expense were pension and postretirement income of 1,369 and 4,571 in foreign currency losses.

 Net income for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was 109,572, or 1.90 per diluted share, compared to 104,261, or 1.81 per diluted share, in the same period of 2023. This represents a 5.1 increase in net income, and a 5.0 increase in diluted earnings per share. The increase in income was driven by higher operating profit, partially offset by increased interest expense. 
 Industrial Precision Solutions 
 Sales of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment were 354,547 in the three months ended January 31, 2024, an increase of 13.8 from sales of 311,546 for the comparable period of 2023. The increase consisted of an acquisition impact of 10.6 , an organic sales increase of 2.3 , and a favorable currency effect of 0.9 . The organic sales increase was driven primarily by industrial coatings, polymer processing and non-wovens product lines. 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 30.6 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to 32.8 in the comparable period of 2023 . The 2.2 percentage point decline in operating margin was primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization expense of 5,923 related to the ARAG acquisition. 
 Medical and Fluid Solutions 
 Sales of the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment were 159,526 in the three months ended January 31, 2024, an increase of 3.4 from sales of 154,287 for the comparable period of 2023. The increase consisted of an organic sales increase of 3.1 , driven by growth in the medical interventional solutions product lines, and a favorable currency effect of 0.3 . 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 28.9 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to 25.5 in the comparable period of 2023 . T he 3.4 percentage point improvement in operating margin was primarily due to improved factory efficiencies and favorable product mix. 
 
 Advanced Technology Solutions 
 Sales of the Advanced Technology Solutions segment were 119,120 in the three months ended January 31, 2024, a decrease of 17.6 from sales of 144,644 for the comparable period of 2023. The decrease was entirely organic as the effects of currency were immaterial. The organic sales decrease was driven by weakness across the segment, primarily electronics dispense products serving semiconductor end markets. 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 16.0 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to 11.7 in the comparable period of 2023 . T he increase in operating margin was primarily due to fees, severance, and non-cash inventory charges of 10,295 recorded in the prior year associated with the CyberOptics acquisition . 
 Income taxes 
 We record our interim provision for income taxes based on our estimated annual effective tax rate, as well as certain items discrete to the current period. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. We have considered several factors in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets which include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. We review our tax positions on a regular basis and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. The effective tax rate for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was 21.0 compared to 20.5 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. 
 Foreign Currency Effects 
 In the aggregate, average exchange rates for 2024 used to translate international sales and operating results into U.S. dollars were generally favorable compared with average exchange rates existing during 2023. It is not possible to precisely measure the impact on operating results arising from foreign currency exchange rate changes, because of changes in selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structure in each country in which we operate. However, if transactions for the three months ended January 31, 2024 were translated at exchange rates in effect during the same period of 2023, we estimated that sales would have been approximately 4,000 lower while costs of sales and selling and administrative expenses would have been approximately 3,000 lower.

 Financial Condition 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 During the three months ended January 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents increased 20,522. Cash provided by operations during this period was 172,356 compared to 123,337 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The primary sources were net income adjusted for non-cash income and expenses, which was 149,668, compared to 136,919 for the three months ended January 31, 2023. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash by 14,614 in the three months ended January 31, 2024 and decreased cash by 58,371 in the comparable period of 2023, driven primarily by improvements in accounts receivable and inventory. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 5,725 for the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to 387,136 used in the comparable period of 2023. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, cash of 7,530 was used for capital expenditures. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, cash of 377,843 was used for the CyberOptics acquisition and 9,302 was used for capital expenditures. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 140,491 for the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to cash provided of 215,693 in the comparable period of 2023. In the three months ended January 31, 2024, cash of 38,855 was used for dividend payments and cash of 7,371 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, versus 37,199 and 6,875, respectively, in the comparable period of 2023. The three months ended January 31, 2024 included net repayments of long-term debt of 107,195, compared to net borrowings of 252,278 during the three months ended January 31, 2023 . 
 The following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from October 31, 2023 to January 31, 2024. Receivables-net decreased 53,184 , primarily due to payments from customers, and goodwill increased by 20,885, principally due to currency translation. 
 The Company is well-positioned to manage liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations, as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. Primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Cash from operations, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is expected to be more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The Company believes it has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its long-term needs for cash. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2024. Refer to our Long-term debt in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our debt outstanding and Term Facility.
