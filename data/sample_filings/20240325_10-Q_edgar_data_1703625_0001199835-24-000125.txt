 NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 January
31, 2024 

. The Company is in immediate need of further working
capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Company s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does
raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue
will be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery
of the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. 

. As of January 31, 2024, the Company had in excess of the FDIC insured limit. 

The
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents for the periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 were excluded from the dilutive loss per
share calculation as they would be antidilutive due to the net loss. As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, there were approximately 
and shares of common stock underlying our outstanding convertible notes payable and warrants, respectively.

On
April 20, 2022, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an individual who is a member of the Company s Board of
Directors. The convertible note payable, with a face value of , bears interest at per annum and was due on .
The convertible note payable is convertible upon default, at the note holder s option, into the Company s common shares at
a fixed conversion rate of 0.05. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company s common stock is potentially highly dilutive
to current shareholders. If the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a result of converting the note into shares
of common stock, then any such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price of the Company s shares. This convertible
promissory note was converted to common stock during the nine months ended January 31, 2024. 

Short
Term Loans 

As
of January 31, 2024, the Company had loans totaling . This consists of three loans totaling , , and . All
three loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had a loan totaling with
a non-related party. This loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. 

On
August 1, 2023, the Company entered into a convertible note payable with an individual who is a member of the Company s Board of
Directors. The note payable, with a face value of , bears interest at per annum and is due on .
The convertible note payable is convertible upon default, at the note holder s option, into the Company s common shares at
a fixed conversion rate of 0.01. The conversion of the note into shares of the Company s common stock is potentially highly dilutive
to current shareholders. If the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a result of converting the note into shares
of common stock, then any such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price of the Company s shares.

at January 31, 2024, our current liabilities were 1,015,131 and stockholders deficit was 866,093. 

As
at January 31, 2024, we had a net working capital deficit of 1,015,131. 

Cash
flows from operating activities 

For
the nine month period ended January 31, 2024 net cash flows used in operating activities was 380,148. 

For
the nine month period ended January 31, 2023 net cash flows used in operating activities was 264,003. 

The
increase in cash used in operating activities is attributable to an increase in net loss due to increased consulting and accounting
expense and increased professional fees. 

Cash
flows from investing activities 

There
were no cash flows from investing activities for the nine month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Cash
flows from financing activities 

For
the nine month period ended January 31, 2024 cash flows provided by financing activities were 173,426. 

For
the nine month period ended January 31, 2023 cash flows provided by financing activities were 217,000. 

The
decrease in cash provided by financing activities is attributable to increased proceeds from the sale of common stock for the nine month
period ended January 31, 2023. 

We
qualify as a smaller reporting company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. 

For
example, smaller reporting companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under Item 402(b) of Regulation
S-K or the auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting. 

Future
Financings 

We
will continue to rely on equity sales of the Company s common shares in order to continue to fund business operations. Issuances
of additional shares will result in dilution to existing shareholders. There is no assurance that the Company will achieve any additional
sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned operations. Future financing activities involving the
sale of common stock under subscription agreements or entering into convertible promissory note agreements may cause substantial dilution
to current shareholders. The Company currently has an active Reg-A for a financial raise.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements 

As
of the date of this report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining a reporting status.
At January 31, 2024, the Company had 0 cash and a working capital deficit of 1,015,131. The Company is in immediate need of further
working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

The
Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent auditors for the year ended April 30, 2023 raises
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is
highly likely that all capital invested in the Company will be lost. 

Management
believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Company s
success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting
requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Company s management will have to spend additional time on
policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement
its business plan and impede the speed of its operations. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the condensed consolidated financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other
new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Responsibility for Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial
reporting. The Company s controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company s President
and Principal Financial Officer to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is accumulated and communicated to
the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as of January 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and reporting of financial information required to be included on our Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have
multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the condensed
consolidated financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
of January 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (as revised). Based on our evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize
and reporting of financial information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports
due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as
a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements and other information
presented herewith are materially correct. 

The
management including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures,
or its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of the control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited resources
and personnel, including those described below. 

The
 Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal
 controls. As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual condensed consolidated financial statements could occur
 and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

We
 have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions. 

We
 do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit
 committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is managements view that to have an audit committee, comprised of independent
 board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over the Company s
 condensed consolidated financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company s limited resources
and personnel. 

18 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
a result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective steps
in implementing internal controls, including the possible remedial measures set forth below. As of January 31, 2024, we did not have
sufficient capital and/or operations to implement any of the remedial measures described below. 

Assessing
 the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and,
 in a cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company s financial
 statements to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional resources for control documentation. 

Assessing
 the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel
 to diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive officers. 

Board
 to review and make recommendations to shareholders concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, with particular focus on
 issues of independence. The Board of Directors will consider nominating an audit committee and audit committee financial expert,
 which may or may not consist of independent members. 

Interviewing
 and potentially hiring outside consultants that are experts in designing internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria
 established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
 of the Treadway Commission COSO (as revised). 

This
quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this quarterly report. 

(b)
Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
Company has not made any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine month period ended January 31, 2024. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
November 9, 2019, the Company filed a declaratory action in the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court for Pinellas County, Florida for the
purpose of obtaining a judicial declaratory judgment as to the Company s status under the Securities laws as to whether the
Company has ever been a Shell Company under the Securities Laws. Pursuant to Chapter 86 of the Florida Statutes the
Court will render a decision whether the Company had ever met the definition of being a shell company under Rule 405 of the
Securities Act, so that all shareholders would be able to utilize Rule 144, and otherwise be able to enjoy complete ownership and
sale of such shares. Such matter is being amended to supply exhibits in a new filing. With a change in designation from being a
 shell risk by OTC Markets, such matter in court was no longer deemed necessary. 

In
May of 2023, TSR was sued in county court over a contract by the firm of Delmar which contends that TSR did not follow through on a contract
for their services related to its regulation A offering in 2022. The Company has defended and is defending such on the basis that Del
Mar never performed on its obligations and therefore was discharged on the contract. Such matter is pending motions by TSR in the county
court. Such lawsuit is seeking 20,000 by Delmar.
