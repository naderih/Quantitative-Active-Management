CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS 

This Report, including, without limitation, statements under the heading
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements can be identified
by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words believes, estimates, anticipates, 
 expects, intends, plans, may, will, potential, projects, 
 predicts, continue, or should, or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable
terminology. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but
are not limited to, any statements relating to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other statements
that are not statements of current or historical facts. These statements are based on management s current expectations, but actual
results may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

our ability to select an appropriate target business or businesses; 

our ability to complete an initial business combination; 

our expectations around the performance of the prospective target business or businesses; 

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

our pool of prospective target businesses; 

our ability to consummate an initial business combination due to the uncertainty resulting from events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or significant outbreaks of infectious diseases; 

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential investment opportunities; 

our public securities potential liquidity and trading; 

the lack of a market for our securities; 

the use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; 

the trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or 

our financial performance following our initial public offering. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our
current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may
not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond
our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied
by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the
heading Risk Factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove
incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may
be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under Risk Factors may not be exhaustive. 

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and
developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements
contained in this Report. In addition, even if our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry
in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Report, those results or developments may not
be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 

iii 

SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 

The following is a summary of the principal risks described below in
Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report. We believe that the risks described in the Risk Factors section
are material to investors, but other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely
affect us. The following summary should not be considered an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing us, and it should be read
in conjunction with the Risk Factors section and the other information contained in this Report. 

The Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange prior to or following the consummation of an initial business combination, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

Our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support such a combination. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote. 

As a result of the Extension Redemptions, our sponsor currently owns a majority of, and possesses controlling voting power with respect to, our outstanding ordinary shares, which will limit public shareholders influence on corporate matters, and our sponsor has agreed to vote in favor of our business combination, regardless of how public shareholders vote. 

The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. 

The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. 

The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would not be consummated and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. 

The requirement that we consummate an initial business combination by November 5, 2024 may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our business combination deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders. 

Any business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations, which may impose conditions on or prevent the consummation of our initial business combination. Such conditions or limitations could also potentially make our public shares less attractive to investors or cause our future investments to be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations. 

As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination. 

We may engage our underwriter from our initial public offering or one of its affiliates to provide additional services to us after our initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as a placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriter is entitled to receive deferred commissions that will be released from the trust only on a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after our initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. 

Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants. 

If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 

iv 

Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless. 

If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate until November 5, 2024, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination. 

You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to consummate an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the company. To mitigate the risk of that result, we instructed CST to liquidate the securities held in the trust account and instead hold all funds in the trust account in demand deposits. As a result, we will likely receive minimal, if any, interest, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount that our public shareholders would have otherwise received upon any redemption or liquidation of the company if the assets in the trust account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange prior to or following the consummation of an initial business combination, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted
company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We are an early
stage and emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

On February 19, 2021, our sponsor paid 25,000 to cover certain of our
offering expenses in consideration for 10,062,500 shares of our Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share. In July 2021, our
sponsor returned to us, for no consideration, an aggregate of 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares, which we cancelled, resulting in an aggregate
of 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding and held by our sponsor. On October 4, 2021, our sponsor transferred 30,000 Class B ordinary
shares to each of our independent directors. On November 2, 2021, the company issued an additional 862,500 Class B ordinary shares to
the sponsor by way of the application of amounts standing to the credit share premium account of the company, resulting in there being
an aggregate of 6,612,500 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. 

On November 5, 2021, the company consummated its initial public offering
of 26,450,000 Units, including an additional 3,450,000 Units as a result of the underwriters exercise of its over-allotment option,
at 10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant, each whole public warrant
exercisable into one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit,
generating gross proceeds to the company of 264,500,000. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and
the issuance and sale of the Units, we consummated the private placement of 12,190,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor and BTIG,
at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 12,190,000. 

Our Management Team 

Our management team consists of a balanced mix of sophisticated investors
and acclaimed operators with a cumulative 37 years in financial services and 49 years of operating experience. Our management team has
a proprietary network of relationships with entrepreneurs, corporate executives, private equity sponsors, venture and growth equity firms,
family offices and sovereign wealth funds to identify, structure, finance and support the operations of a business combination target.
Members of the management team have extensive experience investing in both challenged companies, as well as companies in high growth stages,
within general industrials and construction technology sectors. We believe this combination of investing and operating expertise will
allow us to successfully identify, and provide an attractive value proposition for, potential business combination targets, and differentiates
us from other blank check companies in the marketplace. 

Competitive Strengths 

Our business selection process will capitalize on the deep experience and
network of our management team in consummating an initial business combination. Our competitive strengths and factors that we believe
will contribute to our ability to source attractive opportunities and execute a transaction include the following: 

Strong Management Team with Unique and Complementary Backgrounds : Our management team comprises individuals with the extensive operational, financial and managerial experience needed to effectively navigate the key opportunities and challenges, with deep market knowledge through public private investment and executive leadership experiences. We are confident our management team s distinguished and unique experiences will position our company as a preferred acquiror of attractive assets and enable us to identify, evaluate and execute a successful business combination and create significant value to stakeholders. 

1 

Proven Operational Leadership Experience : Led by Mr. Stern, who has almost 20 years of experience as the founder and CEO of JDS Development Group, our management team has proven abilities in continuously implementing growth and successful operational strategies in building their profitable businesses to scale. Additionally, Mr. Stern has extensive experience in advising other operators including: start-ups, and emerging and mature companies executives and board members. We believe that these qualities are unique and will be crucial in identifying targets with unlocked stakeholder value. 

Extensive Financial Services Experience : Our financial stewardship is led by Messrs. Lerner and Vodola, who have a combined 35 years of experience in the financial services industry, most recently as investment analysts at Citadel, one of the most sophisticated investment firms in the world. They bring specific expertise from their experience investing in both troubled companies with strong inherent fundamental value and in disruptive companies with growth capital needs. Messrs. Lerner and Vodola have invested widely across industries and parts of the capital structure, as well as in numerous different countries, which requires additional skills in analyzing macroeconomic, political, complicated regulatory and other cross-border risks. We believe their investment experience will be instrumental in finding and properly conducting due diligence on a target company. 

Differentiated Deal Sourcing Capabilities : Our management team s positioning as distinguished operators as well as investment professionals with a significant network of company relationships, uniquely positions the Onyx Team to leverage deal flow from attractive potential targets. For example, in the real estate and construction space, Mr. Stern has excellent access to growth-stage companies and, most importantly, the expertise to evaluate the credibility of the product, technology, or service that these companies are offering . We believe that our management team s substantive deal sourcing, structuring and execution experience will be instrumental in facilitating an initial business combination. 

Relevant Transactional Experience : The Onyx Team has been actively involved in tens of billions of dollars of transactions across a broad spectrum of sectors globally, including mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity financings, distressed situations, debt restructurings, spin-offs, secured and unsecured re-financings, and real estate acquisitions and divestitures. We believe this wealth of experience is a key asset that we intend to leverage in our evaluation and execution of attractive business combination opportunities. 

Leveraging Diverse Executive Networks : We believe our management team s extensive and diverse network of relationships with CEOs, founders, family owners, venture capitalists and private equity sponsors will be a key asset in sourcing an initial business combination. 

Uniquely Additive Board Members : Our board members were carefully and are representatives of sophisticated financial institutions whose networks and relationships will help serve as a platform of potential targets, or individuals with unique experience that we believe will be instrumental in finding attractive targets. We believe the expertise of our board members and, where applicable, their respective institutions, will be a material advantage in helping us identify attractive potential targets and executing a successful business combination. 

2 

Business Strategy and Acquisition Criteria 

We intend to leverage what we believe is a competitive advantage in sourcing
potential targets that will materially benefit from our unique expertise and where we are best situated to augment the value of the business
following the completion of the initial business combination. We believe we can provide several significant benefits to potential targets
and public market investors that can potentially lead to attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns in the public markets. 

We are confident that the Onyx Team is well positioned to identify unique
opportunities. Our selection process will leverage a broad and deep network of relationships, diverse set of industry expertise and proven
deal sourcing capabilities of our management team, who bring an array of expertise. Given our profile and thematic approach, we anticipate
that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, as well as the Sponsor Affiliate. We
also believe that the Sponsor Affiliate s reputation, experience and track record will supplement our management team s vast
connections and capabilities and will make us a preferred partner for these potential targets. 

Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general
criteria and guidelines to evaluate prospective target businesses. We may, however, decide to enter into our initial business combination
with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire one or more businesses that we believe: 

can benefit from the extensive networks and expertise we have developed; 

are ready to operate in the scrutiny of public markets, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place; 

will likely be well received by public investors and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that is associated with being a publicly traded company; 

are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, innovation to develop new products or services, improvement of financial performance or growth through a business combination; 

have significant embedded and/or underexploited expansion opportunities; 

exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the market based on our company-specific analysis and due diligence review. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and industry background and trends; and 

will offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. Financial returns will be evaluated based on (1) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (2) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (3) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks. 

We may use other criteria and guidelines as well. Any evaluation relating
to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations,
factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. If we decide to enter an initial business combination with a target business
that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our shareholder communications related to the acquisition.
As discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, this would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we
would file with the SEC. 

3 

Our Acquisition Process 

In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct a thorough
due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with management and employees, document reviews, inspection of
facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. Additionally,
members of our management team and of our board of directors have significant executive management and public company experience and,
accordingly, have developed a deep network of contacts and relationships that will provide us with an important source of acquisition
opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that opportunities will be brought to our attention by various unaffiliated sources, including
investment banks, private equity groups, consultants, accounting firms and other investment market participants. We are not prohibited
from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. In
the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers
or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), or from an independent valuation, appraisal
or accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own founder shares
and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining
whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, certain
of our executive officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if
the retention or resignation of any such executive officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement
with respect to our initial business combination. 

Certain of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in
the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or
will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes
aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual
obligations, he or she may be required to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity
to such entity before we can pursue such opportunity. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors
in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity
and not to us. To address the matters set out above, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we renounce,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, our interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in any business
combination opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and our sponsor and another entity, including any entities managed
by our sponsor or its affiliates and any companies in which our sponsor or such entities have invested or about which any of our officers
or directors acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. In addition, our amended
and restated articles of association will contain provisions to exculpate and indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such
persons in respect of any liability, obligation or duty to our company that may arise as a consequence of such persons becoming aware
of any business opportunity or failing to present such business opportunity. 

Certain of our officers and directors have fiduciary and contractual duties
to the Sponsor Affiliate and its affiliates and to certain companies in which Sponsor Affiliate has invested. As a result, certain of
our officers and directors will have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to certain investment vehicles managed by Sponsor Affiliate
before we can pursue such opportunities. However, we do not expect these duties to present a significant conflict of interest with our
search for an initial business combination. We believe this conflict of interest will be naturally mitigated, to some extent, by the differing
nature of the acquisition targets Sponsor Affiliate typically considers most attractive for the investment vehicles it manages and the
types of acquisitions we expect to find most attractive. Sponsor Affiliate s traditional private equity activities typically involve
investing in private companies, and while Sponsor Affiliate will often take companies public, it typically invests in those entities several
years prior to an initial public offering, not at the time of such offering. As a result, we may become aware of a potential transaction
that is not a fit for the traditional private equity activities of Sponsor Affiliate, but that is an attractive opportunity for us.

Extension of Date to Consummate an Initial Business Combination 

On January 26, 2023, the company held an extraordinary general meeting
of shareholders (the First Extension Meeting at which the company s shareholders approved two proposals to amend
the company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended to date, the Articles ). The
first proposal extended the date by which the company has to consummate a business combination from February 5, 2023 to August 7, 2023
(the First Extension Amendment Proposal ). The second proposal removed the limitation that the company shall not redeem Class
A ordinary shares included as part of the Units sold in its initial public offering (including any shares issued in exchange thereof)
to the extent that such redemption would cause the company s net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (the Redemption
Limitation Amendment Proposal ). 

Based on the results of the First Extension Meeting, our sponsor agreed
to contribute (each such contribution, a Contribution into the trust account the lesser of (x) an aggregate of 120,000
or (y) 0.035 per share for each public share that was not redeemed at the First Extension Meeting for each monthly period until August
7, 2023 (commencing on February 7, 2023 and ending on the 7th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the
company to complete its initial business combination. In connection with the approval of the First Extension Amendment Proposal, 22,239,972
Class A ordinary shares were redeemed and 4,210,028 Class A ordinary shares were not redeemed. As a result, the aggregate monthly Contribution
payable by the sponsor to us is 120,000. 

On January 26, 2023, in connection with the
First Extension Meeting, the holders of the company s founder shares converted all of their Class B ordinary shares into Class A
ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the conversions, such holders will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the trust account as
a result of their ownership of any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the founder shares. 

On February 7, 2023, we issued a promissory note in the principal amount
of up to 720,000 to our sponsor (the Extension Note ), evidencing our indebtedness with respect to the Contributions (the
 Extension Loans ). The Extension Loans are unsecured and non-interest bearing, and will be repayable by the company upon
consummation of an initial business combination. If the company does not consummate an initial business combination by November 5, 2024,
the Extension Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the trust account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. 

On July 21, 2023, the company held an extraordinary general meeting of
shareholders (the Second Extension Meeting at which the company s shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Articles.
The proposal amended the date by which the company has to consummate a business combination from August 7, 2023 to February 7, 2024 (the
 Second Extension Amendment Proposal ). 

In connection with the Second Extension Meeting, holders of 2,198,202 Class
A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.83 per share,
for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 23,802,065. As a result, such amount was removed from the trust account to pay such
holders and 2,011,826 Class A ordinary shares and 6,612,500 converted founder shares were left outstanding for a total
of 8,624,326 Class A ordinary shares outstanding. 

On October 24, 2023, the company received a written notice (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq notifying the company that, since the company s Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 2023 reported total holders below the round lot holder requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2), the company no
longer complies with Nasdaq s Listing Rules. On December 7, 2023, the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq granted the
company an extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) on or before April 22, 2024. The Notice does not impact
the listing of the Company s Class A ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market as of the date of filing this Annual Report. 

On November 3, 2023, we amended and restated the Extension Note (hereinafter,
the Restated Note increasing the aggregate principal amount to 1,470,000. The Restated Note may be drawn down by us form
time to time prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. The Restated Note does not bear interest, matures on the date
of consummation of the initial business combination and is subject to customary events of default. As of December 31, 2023, the company
has on outstanding balance of 1,385,000 under the Restated Note. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased an aggregate of 720,000
in investments in the trust account from the monthly Extension Loans. 

On January 29, 2024, the company held an extraordinary
general meeting of shareholders (the Third Extension Meeting, and, together with the First Extension Meeting and the Second
Extension Meeting, the Extension Meetings at which the company s shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Articles.
The proposal extended the date by which the company has to consummate a business combination from February 7, 2024 to November 5, 2024
(the Third Extension Amendment Proposal, and, together with the First Extension Amendment Proposal and the Second Extension
Amendment Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposals ). 

In connection with the vote to approve the Third Extension Amendment Proposal,
holders of 678,865 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately
 11.13 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 7.6 million (the redemptions made in connection with the Extension
Amendment Proposals, the Extension Redemptions ). As a result, approximately 7,553,041 will be removed from the Trust Account
to pay such holders and 1,332,961 Class A ordinary shares (excluding 6,612,500 converted founder shares) remain outstanding, for a total
of 7,945,461 shares outstanding. 

Initial Business Combination 

So long as our securities are then listed on the Nasdaq, our initial business
combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net
assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust
account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80 
of net assets test. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we
will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or appraisal
firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent
determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or
experienced with the target company s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company s
assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction
involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or
necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business
meets the 80 of net assets test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the
consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if
required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed
transaction will include such opinion. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a
majority of our independent directors.

The company is in advanced discussions with Helios Investment Partners
about a potential business combination which would result in the creation of a new publicly listed energy transition infrastructure platform,
Helios Energy Transition Infrastructure HETI ), focused on the development of natural gas and low-carbon energy infrastructure
businesses and assets in Africa (the Proposed Transaction ). HETI currently owns and is developing a portfolio of strategic
infrastructure assets and businesses delivering the energy transition in Africa. This portfolio spans the natural gas, LNG and power value
chain comprising liquefaction, storage, regasification, pipeline infrastructure and power plants, supplying gas and power to over 200
industrial customers and utilities across Africa on a long-term contracted basis. The portfolio supports the displacement of expensive
and polluting coal and liquid fuels with cleaner, more affordable natural gas in its target markets. In addition, HETI is developing a
pipeline of low-carbon fuel (blue and green hydrogen) and renewable/low-carbon power projects which will utilize best-in-class partnerships
and technology to take advantage of Africa s renewable resource advantage and proximity to global end markets to support the global
Net Zero ambition. The company intends to announce additional details regarding the potential business combination if and when a definitive
agreement is executed. Currently, there is no binding agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction, and negotiations remain subject
to significant contingencies, including the completion of due diligence, the negotiation and execution of a mutually acceptable definitive
agreement, confirmation and documentation of fully committed financing, and requisite shareholder approvals. There can be no assurances
that the company will successfully negotiate a definitive agreement, or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated. 

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the
post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the outstanding equity interests
or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business
combination company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives
of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business
combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling
interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50 or more of the
voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business
combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a
transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other
equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance
of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority
of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the outstanding equity interests or assets
of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses
that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80 of net assets test. If the business combination involves more
than one target business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition,
we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
If our securities are not then listed on the Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80 of net
assets test. 

To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company
or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent
in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we
cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. The time required to select and evaluate a target
business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently
ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target
business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the
funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner
to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering
through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business
may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company)
or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the
typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical
business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public
offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same
extent in connection with a business combination with us. 

6 

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target
business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter s ability
to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have
negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional
means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for
acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers
and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

While we believe that our structure and our management team s backgrounds
will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our
lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section
2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As such, we are
eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that
are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and
proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder
approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result,
there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition
period. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the
last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have
total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which
we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0
billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined
in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including,
among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements and, if their revenues are less than 100 million, not providing
an independent registered public accounting firm attestation on internal control over financial reporting. We will remain a smaller reporting
company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 250
million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed
fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal
quarter of that year. 

Financial Position 

We expect to complete our initial business combination using our cash,
debt or equity securities, third-party financing (for example, a private placement of our securities), or a combination of the foregoing,
which will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken
any steps to secure third-party financing, and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

7 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

General 

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations
for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using
cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of
our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may
enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued
to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. We may seek to complete our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth,
which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or
not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business
combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other companies or for working capital. 

We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business
combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because
we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we
may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to
issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the potential availability of the backstop
arrangement with our sponsor, we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising
any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 

Sources of Target Businesses 

We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention
from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants,
accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result
of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may
be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we
are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that
they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well
as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would
not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not
presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any
formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting
fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage
a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be
available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our
best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee
will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors,
or their respective affiliates be paid by us any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services
they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it
is). An affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to provide members of our management team with office space, secretarial and administrative
support at no cost and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an
initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business
combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used
as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. 

8 

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with
a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination
with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors,
will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent valuation, appraisal
or accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Management may also recuse
themselves from investment discussions of companies that are affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. 

Certain of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in
the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our
sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity.
Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to
which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to honor such fiduciary or contractual
obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity before we can pursue such opportunity. 

Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business
Combination 

In evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive
due diligence review to seek to determine a company s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among
other things, multiple meetings with incumbent management, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, consultations with
relevant industry experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of additional information
that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company. Additionally, we will likely hire outside accountants to do quality
of earnings reviews and may hire outside consultants to analyze market trends. We will also utilize our management team s operational
and capital planning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate
the terms of the business combination transaction. 

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure
and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree
of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business
with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds
we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or
their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed
not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our
Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation
of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us
to pay our income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At the
completion of our initial business combination, we will be required to purchase any ordinary shares properly delivered for redemption
and not withdrawn. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder
must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business
combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder
has properly elected to redeem its shares if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team
have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder
shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder
vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with
our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by November
5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 

9 

Limitations on Redemptions 

Prior to the First Extension Meeting, our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association provided that we would in no event redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible
assets to be less than 5,000,001. At the First Extension Meeting, our shareholders approved the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal,
which removed this limitation from the company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, the proposed
business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target
for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with
the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class
A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms
of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination
or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with
a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek
shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will
be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek
shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer
(which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases
would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where
we issue more than 20 of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder
vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on the
Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the Nasdaq rules. 

If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination,
we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business
combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights
described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that, if we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary
resolution under Cayman Islands law, at a general meeting of the company, unless applicable law or applicable stock exchange rules require
a higher vote, in which case we will complete our initial business combination only if such requisite vote is received. In such case,
our sponsor and each member of our management team, in their capacity as members of the company, will count toward this quorum and have
agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will be
present if the holders of one-third of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are present in person or by proxy
and, for purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business
combination once a quorum is obtained. Assuming that only one-third of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, representing a quorum
under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association are voted, we will not need any public shares in addition to our
founder shares to be voted in favor of an initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreement of
our sponsor, officers and directors, will make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder
may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition,
our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business
combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)
that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their
shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary
shares. 

10 

If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder
vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 

conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we
elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance
with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules,
our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will
not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender
offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public
shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business
combination. 

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business
Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and
we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or
any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange
Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public
offering, which we refer to as Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders
from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights
against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to
the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate
of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares
are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By
limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior
consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete
our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition
that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 

However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to
vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 

11 

Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or
the Exercise of Redemption Rights 

Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether
they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, will be required to either tender their certificates (if any)
to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders,
or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At
Custodian) System, at the holder s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve
the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public
shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the
requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would
have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior
to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to
tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption
rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering
process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the
tendering broker a fee of approximately 80.00, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming
holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender
their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery
must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check
companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute
proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed
business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After
the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate
to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination,
during which he or she could monitor the price of the company s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price,
he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation.
As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option 
rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement
for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder s election to redeem is irrevocable
once the business combination is approved. 

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time
up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed
to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and
subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer
agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public
shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. If our initial
business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption
rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly
return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue
to try to complete a business combination with a different target until November 5, 2024. 

12 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business
Combination 

Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that we will have only until November 5, 2024 to consummate an initial business combination. If we have not consummated an initial business
combination by November 5, 2024, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously
released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of
the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including
the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail
to consummate an initial business combination by November 5, 2024. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that, if a resolution of the company s shareholders is passed pursuant to the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands to commence the
voluntary liquidation of the company, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. 

Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect
to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination by November 5, 2024 (although they will be entitled
to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within the prescribed time frame). Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement
with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify
the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in
connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless
we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding
public shares. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at
such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any
executive officer, director, or any other person. 

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our
plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the 44,165 held outside the trust
account immediately following our initial public offering, plus up to 100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay
dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account and any tax payments or expenses
for the dissolution of the trust, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or
expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be 10.20.
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority
than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders
will not be less than 10.20. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to
pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

13 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective
target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they
will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust
account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims
challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including
the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the
trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with
a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party s engagement would be significantly more
beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses to execute a waiver
include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly
superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider
willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP Marcum will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies
held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future
as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account
for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and
to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting
firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the
trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account
as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than 10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust
assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not
apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the
trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party,
our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor
to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy
its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure
you that our sponsor will be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third
parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the
lesser of (i) 10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation
of the trust account if less than 10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its
indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would
determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that
our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us,
it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less
than 10.20 per public share. 

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify
the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other
entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies
held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial
public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is
subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account
could be liable for claims made by creditors. However, such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account
received by any such shareholder. 

If we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy
or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable
bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.20 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary
bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed
under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent
conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders.
Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad
faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account
prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

14 

Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by November
5, 2024, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify
the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in
connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii)
if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem
their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled
to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated
an initial business combination by November 5, 2024, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances
will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection
with our initial business combination, a shareholder s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result
in a shareholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have
also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association,
like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial
business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including
other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions.
Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or
through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability
to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage
in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who
exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants,
and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors
may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Facilities 

We currently maintain our executive offices at 104 5 th Avenue,
New York, New York 10011. An affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to provide members of our management team with office space, secretarial
and administrative services at no cost. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 

Website 

We maintain a corporate website at www.onyxacqu.com. Our website and information
contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part
of, this Report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities. 

Employees 

We currently have four officers. These individuals are not obligated to
devote any specific number of hours to our matters but intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until
we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether
a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under
the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the
SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported
on by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

15 

We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective
target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements
may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America GAAP ), or International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS ), depending on the circumstances, and
the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) PCAOB ). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses
we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance
with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any
particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance
with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance
with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed
target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer
or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered
public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance
with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls
of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

On November 2, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with
the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations
promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under
the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman
Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempt from complying with certain provisions
of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government
that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date
of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciation
will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciation or which is in
the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii)
by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders
or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section
2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various
reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including,
but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements
of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously
approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities,
and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting
standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended
transition period. 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the
last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have
total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which
we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0
billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined
in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including,
among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements and, if their revenues are less than 100 million, not providing
an independent registered public accounting firm attestation on internal control over financial reporting. We will remain a smaller reporting
company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 250
million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed
fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal
quarter of that year.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You
should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Report and the final
prospectus associated with our initial public offering, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following
events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading
price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

Risks Relating to our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to
Consummate, a Business Combination 

We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues,
and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 

We are a blank check company established under the laws of the Cayman Islands
with no operating results. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business
objective of completing our initial business combination. We may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to
complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. 

Our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote
on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our
public shareholders do not support such a combination. 

We may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial
business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing
requirements. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration we were paying in the transaction
was all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except for as required by
applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business
combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and
will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise
require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of
our issued and outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination,
our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our
public shareholders vote. 

Our initial shareholders own, on an as-converted basis, approximately 83.3 
of our outstanding ordinary shares. Our sponsor and members of our management team also may, from time to time, purchase Class A ordinary
shares prior to our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we
seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution
under Cayman Islands law at a general meeting of the company, unless applicable law or applicable stock exchange rules require a higher
vote, in which case we will complete our initial business combination only if such requisite vote is received. In such case, our sponsor
and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination.
A quorum for such meeting will be present if the holders of one-third of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting
are present in person or by proxy and, for purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the
approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, the sponsor would have the ability to approve any
initial business combination without the participation of public shareholders. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial
business combination, the agreement by our initial shareholders, independent directors and management team to vote in favor of our initial
business combination will allow us to obtain the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination.

Your opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential
business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash. 

At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an
opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination
without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless
we seek such shareholder approval. Even if we seek such shareholder approval, our sponsor will be able to approve an initial business
combination without the support of public shareholders. Accordingly, your opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential
business combination will be limited to exercising your redemption rights. 

As a result of the Extension Redemptions, our sponsor currently owns
a majority of, and possesses controlling voting power with respect to, our outstanding ordinary shares, which will limit public shareholders 
influence on corporate matters. Additionally, our sponsor has agreed to vote in favor of the business combination, regardless of how public
shareholders vote. 

As a result of the Extension Redemptions, our sponsor owns and is entitled
to vote an aggregate of approximately 82.2 of our outstanding ordinary shares, which represents a majority of outstanding ordinary shares.
As such, our sponsor has the ability to control our affairs outright through the election and removal of the entire board of directors
and all other matters requiring shareholder approval, including a future business combination, merger or consolidation of the company,
or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control limits our public float and could discourage others from
initiating any such potential merger, consolidation or sale or other change-of-control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to
our stockholders. Furthermore, this concentrated control will limit the practical effect of your participation in corporate matters, through
shareholder votes and otherwise. 

In addition, our sponsor has agreed to vote its shares in favor of an initial
business combination. These shares are sufficient to approve an initial business combination and all other proposals being presented at
the relevant meeting. Accordingly, if and when we present an initial business to our shareholders for a vote, we expect to be able to
obtain the necessary shareholder approval for such business combination and other proposals, even if our public shareholders vote against
the business combination and such proposals. 

The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for
cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter
into a business combination with a target. 

We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement
with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many
public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we may not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be
able to proceed with the business combination. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not
be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with a business combination, and such amount of deferred underwriting discount
is not available for us to use as consideration in an initial business combination. If we are able to consummate an initial business combination,
the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming shareholders will reflect our obligation to pay and the payment of the deferred underwriting
commissions. 

18 

In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposals, shareholders
holding 25,117,039 Class A ordinary shares (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares
for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 260.4 million (approximately 10.37 per share) was
removed from the trust account to pay such redeeming holders. 

The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights
with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital
structure. 

In connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposals, shareholders
holding 25,117,039 Class A ordinary shares (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares
for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 260.4 million (approximately 10.37 per share) was
removed from the trust account to pay such redeeming holders. 

At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination,
we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore, will need to structure the transaction based
on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If a large number of shares are submitted for redemption,
we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for additional third-party
financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher
than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to
us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted
for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders
who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission, and after such redemptions,
the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. 

The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights
with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would not be consummated
and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. 

If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion
of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability
that our initial business combination would not be consummated is increased. If our initial business combination is not consummated, you
would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of
immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market however, at such time, our shares may trade at a discount
to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose
the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption of our public shares until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares
in the open market. 

Because our trust account will initially contain 10.20 per Class
A ordinary share, public shareholders may be more incentivized to redeem their public shares at the time of our initial business combination. 

Our trust account will initially contain 10.20 per Class A ordinary share.
This is different than some other similarly structured blank check companies for which the trust account will only contain 10.00 per
Class A ordinary share. As a result of the additional funds that could be available to public shareholders upon redemption of public shares,
our public shareholders may be more incentivized to redeem their public shares and not to hold those Class A ordinary shares through our
initial business combination. A higher percentage of redemptions by our public shareholders could make it more difficult for us to complete
our initial business combination. 

19 

The requirement that we consummate an initial business combination
by November 5, 2024 may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time
we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our business combination
deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders. 

Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning
a business combination will be aware that we must consummate an initial business combination by November 5, 2024. Consequently, such target
business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination
with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk
will increase as we get closer to the time frame described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may
enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. 

We may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors
which may or may not be outside of our management s area of expertise. 

We will consider an initial business combination outside of our management s
area of expertise if an initial business combination target is presented to us, and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive
business combination opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular
business combination target, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We
also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors than a direct
investment, if an opportunity were available, in an initial business combination target. In the event we elect to pursue an initial business
combination outside of the areas of our management s expertise, our management s expertise may not be directly applicable
to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus regarding the areas of our management s expertise
would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately
ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following our
initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for
such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors
of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws
that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material
misstatement or material omission. 

Any business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment
regulations, which may impose conditions on or prevent the consummation of our initial business combination. Such conditions or limitations
could also potentially make our public shares less attractive to investors or cause our future investments to be subject to U.S. foreign
investment regulations. 

Investments that involve the acquisition of, or investment in, a U.S. business
by a non-U.S. investor may be subject to U.S. laws that regulate foreign investments in U.S. businesses and access by foreign
persons to technology developed and produced in the United States. These laws include Section 721 of the Defense Production
Act of 1950, as amended by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, and the regulations at 31
C.F.R. Parts 800 and 802, as amended, administered by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS ). 

Whether CFIUS has jurisdiction to review an acquisition or investment transaction
depends on, among other factors, the nature and structure of the transaction, including the level of beneficial ownership interest and
the nature of any information or governance rights involved. For example, investments that result in control of a U.S. business 
by a foreign person (in each case, as such terms are defined in 31 C.F.R. Part 800) always are subject to CFIUS
jurisdiction. Significant CFIUS reform legislation, which was fully implemented through regulations that became effective in 2020, expanded
the scope of CFIUS s jurisdiction to investments that do not result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person, but
afford certain foreign investors certain information or governance rights in a U.S. business that has a nexus to critical
technologies, covered investment critical infrastructure, and/or sensitive personal data (in each case,
as such terms are defined in 31 C.F.R. Part 800). 

All of our Sponsor s managers and officers are U.S. citizens
and all owners of our Sponsor are also U.S. citizens. Our Sponsor is not controlled by, and does not have substantial ties to, any
 foreign person such that a business combination would automatically be subject to CFIUS review. However, depending on the
beneficial ownership of any prospective target company and the composition and governance rights of any PIPE investors in connection with
a business combination, a business combination could result in investments that would be considered by CFIUS to be covered investments
or a covered control transaction that CFIUS would have authority to review. 

 To the extent that this occurs, CFIUS or another U.S. governmental
agency could choose to review a business combination or past or proposed transactions involving new or existing foreign investors in the
prospective target company, even if a filing with CFIUS is or was not required at the time of such transaction. Any review and approval
of an investment or transaction by CFIUS may have outsized impacts on transaction certainty, timing, feasibility, and cost, among other
things. CFIUS policies and agency practices are rapidly evolving, and in the event that CFIUS reviews a business combination or one or
more proposed or existing investments by foreign investors in a prospective target company, there can be no assurances that such investors
will be able to maintain, or proceed with, such investments on terms acceptable to the parties to a business combination or such investors.
Among other things, CFIUS could seek to impose limitations or restrictions on, or prohibit, a business combination or investments by such
investors. CFIUS could also order us to divest all or a portion of a target company if we had proceeded without first obtaining CFIUS
clearance. 

If CFIUS elects to review a business combination, the time necessary to
complete such review of the business combination or a decision by CFIUS to prohibit the business combination could prevent us from completing
a business combination prior to November 5, 2024. 

If we are not able to consummate a business combination by November 5,
2024, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not
more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which
interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will
completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders
and our board, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants,
which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up. Finally, the company s public shareholders will not receive the benefit
of any price appreciation of our public shares that might result from a business combination with a target company. 

We may not be able to consummate an initial business combination
by November 5, 2024, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares
and liquidate. 

We may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate an
initial business combination by November 5, 2024. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted
by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. Other than in connection
with a redemption offer or liquidation, our shareholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our shares
on the open market. The price of our shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that shareholders will be able to dispose of
our shares at favorable prices, or at all. 

If we have not consummated an initial business combination within such
applicable time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible
but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released
to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding
public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval
of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if a resolution of the company s shareholders is passed pursuant to
the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands to commence the voluntary liquidation of the company, we will follow the foregoing procedures
with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. In either such case, our public shareholders may receive only 10.20 per public share, or less
than 10.20 per public share, on the redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See - If third parties
bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders
may be less than 10.20 per public share and other risk factors herein.

A 1 U.S. federal excise tax could be imposed on us in connection
with redemptions by us of our shares. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
(the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a U.S. federal 1 excise tax
on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries
of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which
shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of
the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value
of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions
apply to the excise tax. Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse
or avoidance of the excise tax. In this regard, on December 27, 2022, Treasury and the IRS issued a notice announcing their intent
to issue proposed regulations addressing the application of the excise tax, and describing certain rules on which taxpayers may rely prior
to the issuance of such proposed regulations. The IR Act applies only to repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. 

Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31,
2022 in connection with a business combination particularly one that involves our combination with a U.S. entity
and/or our re-domestication as a U.S. corporation may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent
we would be subject to the excise tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions
and repurchases in connection with any such business combination, (ii) the structure of any such business combination, (iii) the
nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with any such business combination (or otherwise issued
not in connection with such business combination but issued within the same taxable year of the business combination) and (iv) the
content of regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be
payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The
foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a business combination and in our ability to complete a business
combination. 

As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating
targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase
the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business
combination. 

In recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that
have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into
an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business
combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available
to consummate an initial business combination. 

In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies
seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals
or business models may increase, which could cause target companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become
scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions including between the U.S. and China and
Russia s invasion of Ukraine, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets
post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate
an initial business combination and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our
investors altogether. 

We may engage our underwriter from our initial public offering or
one of its affiliates to provide additional services to us after our initial public offering, which may include acting as financial advisor
in connection with an initial business combination or as a placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriter
is entitled to receive deferred commissions that will be released from the trust only on a completion of an initial business combination.
These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after
our initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. 

We may engage our underwriter from our initial public offering or one of
its affiliates to provide additional services to us after our initial public offering, including, for example, identifying potential targets,
providing financial advisory services, acting as a placement agent in a private offering or arranging debt financing. We may pay our underwriter
from our initial public offering or its affiliate fair and reasonable fees or other compensation that would be determined at that time
in an arm s length negotiation. The underwriter is also entitled to receive deferred commission that is conditioned on the completion
of an initial business combination. The underwriter s or its affiliates financial interests tied to the consummation of a
business combination transaction may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in providing any such additional services to us, including
potential conflicts of interest in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. 

Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance
could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. 

Since our initial public offering, the market for directors and officers
liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed in ways adverse to us and our management team. Fewer insurance
companies are offering quotes for director and officer liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased
and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. These trends may continue into the future. 

The increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers
liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain
directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination
entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and
officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination s ability to attract and retain qualified
officers and directors. 

21 

In addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination,
our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior
to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and executive officers, the post-business combination
entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims run-off insurance ). The need for run-off
insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate
an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination,
our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or
warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A ordinary
shares or public warrants. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and
we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial
shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are
under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares or warrants our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, other than
as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated
any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants
in such transactions. 

In the event that our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive
officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already
elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their
shares. The purpose of any such transaction could be to vote in favor of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in
an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business
combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the
completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. The purpose of any such purchases of public
warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant
holders for approval in connection with our business combination. We expect that any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section
13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 

If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our
public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such
shares may not be redeemed. 

We will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable,
when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder
fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity
to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of
our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with
in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares
may not be redeemed. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination
and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of shareholders are deemed to
hold in excess of 15 of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15 of our Class
A ordinary shares. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and
we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or
any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange
Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public
offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares, without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders 
ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem
the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material
loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions
with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number
of shares exceeding 15 and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially
at a loss. 

22 

Because of our limited resources and the significant competition
for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated
our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per public
share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. 

We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check
companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals
and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of
companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other
resources or more local industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those
of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds
of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition
of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation
gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of
our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder
vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If
we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately
 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will
expire worthless. See - If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced, and
the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than 10.20 per public share and other risk factors herein. 

If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate until November 5, 2024, it
could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business
combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to
complete our initial business combination. 

Of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants, as of December 31, 2023, only 44,165 is available to us outside the trust account to fund our working capital
requirements. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account, together with funds available from loans from our
sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least November 5, 2024 
however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate, and our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team are under
no obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Of the funds available to us, we expect to use a portion of the funds available
to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down
payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from shopping 
around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we
paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to surrender such funds (whether as a
result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect
to, a target business. 

If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow
funds from our sponsor, its affiliates, members of our management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate.
Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor their affiliates is under any obligation to us in such circumstances. Any such
advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business
combination. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of 1.00
per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of
our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our
management team as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights
to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period
because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently,
our public shareholders may only receive an estimated 10.20 per public share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares,
and our warrants will expire worthless. See - If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account
could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than 10.20 per public share and other
risk factors herein. 

23 

If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the
trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than 10.20 per public share. 

Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from
third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities
with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held
in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute
such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement,
breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case
in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party
refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of
the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management
believes that such third-party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. 

Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that refuses
to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management
to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable
to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies
held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future
as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account
for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not consummated an initial business combination by November, 5, 2024,
or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment
of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the ten years following redemption. Accordingly, the
per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the 10.20 per public share initially held in the trust
account due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement that we have entered into with our sponsor, officers and directors,
in order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any
claims by a third-party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business
with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i)
 10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the
trust account if less than 10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest
that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective
target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under
our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, our sponsor will not be responsible
to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 

However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification
obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe
that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to
satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our
initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than 10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able
to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of
your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims
by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations
of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders. 

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the
lesser of (i) 10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation
of the trust account if less than 10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that
it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action
against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal
action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors
in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our
independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for
distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below 10.20 per public share. 

24 

We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims
of our directors and executive officers. 

We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent
permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are
entitled to funds from the trust account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able
to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination.
Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors
for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against
our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a
shareholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers
and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 

If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our
public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against
us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors
may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us
to claims of punitive damages. 

If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public
shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that
is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency
laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages
by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. 

25 

If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our
public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against
us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share
amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 

If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public
shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that
is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included
in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any
bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with
our liquidation may be reduced. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it
difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act, our activities may be restricted, including: 

restrictions on the nature of our investments; and 

restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which
may make it difficult for us to complete an initial business combination. 

In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: 

registration as an investment company with the SEC; 

adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and 

reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure
requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to. 

In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing,
reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading investment
securities constituting more than 40 of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated
basis. 

We do not believe that our principal activities and our initial business
combination will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account were only to be invested
in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. By restricting the investment of the
proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than
on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an investment
company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. An investment in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking
a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account was intended as a holding place for funds
pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any
Class A ordinary shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our Articles (a) to modify the substance
or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection
with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our Class A ordinary shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination by November 5, 2024, or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A
ordinary shares; or (iii) absent an initial business combination by November 5, 2024, our return of the funds held in the trust account
to the public shareholders as part of our redemption of the Class A ordinary shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed
above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance
with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability
to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination, the public shareholders may only receive
their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to the public shareholders, and our warrants
will expire worthless. 

If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the
Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to consummate an initial business combination and instead be required
to liquidate the company. To mitigate the risk of that result, we instructed CST to liquidate the securities held in the trust account
and instead hold all funds in the trust account in demand deposits. As a result, we will likely receive minimal, if any, interest, on
the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount that our public shareholders would have otherwise received upon
any redemption or liquidation of the company if the assets in the trust account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market
funds. 

It is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as
an unregistered investment company. Following our initial public offering, the funds in the trust account were initially held in U.S.
government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a majority of 185 days or
less in money market fund investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act. The longer that the funds in the trust account were held in short-term U.S. government treasury obligations
or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, the greater the risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment
company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, in which case we may be required to liquidate the company. 

If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment
Company Act, we might be forced to abandon our efforts to consummate an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate
the company. If we are required to liquidate the company, our investors would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in
a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and warrants following such a transaction,
and our warrants would expire worthless. 

As a result, prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of
the registration statement relating to our initial public offering, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company CST ),
the trustee with respect to the trust account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the trust
account and thereafter to hold all funds in the trust account in demand deposits (i.e., in one or more bank accounts) until the earliest
of the company s consummation of an initial business combination or November 5, 2024, as applicable. Following such liquidation
of the assets in the trust account, we will likely earn less, if any, interest, on the funds held in the trust account compared to potential
interest earned if the assets in the trust account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds, which reduces
the dollar amount our public shareholders would have otherwise received upon any redemption or liquidation of the company. This means
that the amount available for redemption will not increase at the same rate in the future. 

Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws
and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and
results of operations. 

We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and
local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring
of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and
application may also change from time to time, and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and
results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination and results
of operations. 

Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against
us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. 

If we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions
received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution
was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to
recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary
duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public
shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought
against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to
be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would
be guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of approximately 18,000 and imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands. 

27 

Because we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in
a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination,
you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business s operations. 

We may pursue business combination opportunities in any sector, except
that we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business
combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached
any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any
particular target business s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the
extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which
we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings,
we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although
our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we
will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore,
some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will
adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable
to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders
who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders
are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the
breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring
a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination
contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 

Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that
we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target
that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination
may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. 

Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating
prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not
have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of
these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria
and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and
guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing
condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder
approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval
for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the
target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within
the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount in
certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. 

28 

We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting
or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the
business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. 

Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated
entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly
renders valuation opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained,
our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally
accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable,
related to our initial business combination. 

We may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares
to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination.
Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. 

Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize
the issuance of up to 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share, 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value
 0.0001 per share, and 5,000,000 preference shares, par value 0.0001 per share. As of March 15, 2024, there are 492,054,539 and 50,000,000
authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance, which amount does not
take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants, if any. There are no preference shares issued and
outstanding. 

We may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares
or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial
business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redeeming the warrants. However, our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that prior to or in connection with our initial business
combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or
(ii) vote on any initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection with the completion
of an initial business combination. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions
of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional
Class A ordinary shares or preference shares: 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; 

29 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and 

may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants. 

Resources could be wasted in researching business combinations that
are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If
we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately
 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will
expire worthless. 

We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and
the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management
time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business
combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach
an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons
including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could materially adversely
affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business combination
within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount
in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. 

Investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates
may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. 

JDS Development Group and its affiliates manage several investment vehicles.
Investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these investment
vehicles decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated
within JDS Development Group, including by Michael Stern and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for
both us and for a current or future investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates and may be directed to such
investment vehicles rather than to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Neither JDS Development Group nor members of our management
team or our directors who are also employed by JDS Development Group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential
business combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or managing directors of JDS Development Group. 

30 

JDS Development Group and/or our management, in their capacities as officers
or managing directors of JDS Development Group or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the
related entities described above, current or future investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates, or third parties,
before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. In addition, JDS Development Group or its affiliates
may sponsor other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and
members of our management team or our directors may participate in such blank check companies. 

We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses
that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, which may raise potential
conflicts of interest. 

In light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors
with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. Our
directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. They may also have investments in target businesses. Our sponsor,
officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are
seeking an initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Although we are not
specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined
that such affiliated entity met our criteria and guidelines for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority
of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
that is a member of FINRA or from an independent valuation, appraisal or accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a
financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive
officers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not
be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. 

Members of our management team and board of directors have significant
experience as founders, board members, officers, executives or employees of other companies. Certain of those persons have been, may be,
or may become, involved in litigation, investigations or other proceedings, including related to those companies or otherwise. The defense
or prosecution of these matters could be time-consuming and could divert our management s attention, and may have an adverse effect
on us, which may impede our ability to consummate an initial business combination. 

During the course of their careers, members of our management team and
board of directors have had significant experience as founders, board members, officers, executives or employees of other companies. As
a result of their involvement and positions in these companies, certain of those persons have been, may be or may in the future become
involved in litigation, investigations or other proceedings, including relating to the business affairs of such companies, transactions
entered into by such companies, or otherwise. Individual members of our management team and board of directors also may become involved
in litigation, investigations or other proceedings involving claims or allegations related to or as a result of their personal conduct,
either in their capacity as a corporate officer or director or otherwise, and may be personally named in such actions and potentially
subject to personal liability. Any such liability may or may not be covered by insurance and/or indemnification, depending on the facts
and circumstances. The defense or prosecution of these matters could be time-consuming. Any litigation, investigations or other proceedings
and the potential outcomes of such actions may divert the attention and resources of our management team and board of directors away from
identifying and selecting a target business or businesses for our initial business combination and may negatively affect our reputation,
which may impede our ability to complete an initial business combination. 

31 

Since our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their
entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire
during or after our initial public offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination
target is appropriate for our initial business combination. 

On February 19, 2021, our sponsor paid 25,000, or approximately 0.002
per share, to cover certain expenses on our behalf in consideration of 10,062,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001. Prior to
the initial investment in the company of 25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. In July 2021, our
sponsor returned to us, for no consideration an aggregate of 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares, which we canceled, resulting in an aggregate
of 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding and held by our sponsor. In October 2021, our sponsor transferred 30,000 Class B ordinary
shares to each of our independent directors. On November 2, 2021, the company issued an additional 862,5000 Class B ordinary shares to
the sponsor by way of the application of amounts standing to the credit of the share premium account of the company, resulting in there
being an aggregate of 6,612,500 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing
the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. 

On January 26, 2023, the holders of our founder shares converted all of
their Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the conversions, such holders will not be entitled to receive
any monies held in the trust account as a result of their ownership of any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the founder
shares. These shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor and BTIG purchased
12,190,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment,
at a price of 1.00 per warrant, in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. If
we do not consummate an initial business combination by November 5, 2024, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The personal
and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination,
completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This
risk may become more acute as November 5, 2024 nears, which is the deadline for our consummation of an initial business combination. 

We may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial
debt, to complete an initial business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively
impact the value of our shareholders investment in us. 

We may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business
combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver
of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, we do not expect any issuance
of debt to affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have
a variety of negative effects, including: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand; 

32 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt; and 

reducing the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders to less than 10.20 per public share. See - If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than 10.20 per public share and other risk factors herein. 

We may only be able to complete one business combination with the
proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on
a single business, which may have a limited number of products or services and limited operating activities. This lack of diversification
may negatively impact our operations and profitability. 

We may effectuate our initial business combination with a single-target
business or multiple-target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our
initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting
issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the
financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business
combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments.
Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike
other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a
single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be: 

solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset or 

dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive
and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent
to our initial business combination. 

33 

We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with
multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs
and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. 

If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned
by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous
closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business
combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect
to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent
assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to
adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations. 

We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with
a private company about which little information is available, which may result in an initial business combination with a company that
is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. 

In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial
business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could
be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which
may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. 

We may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree
of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results. 

We may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex
companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that
our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we
anticipate. 

To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large
complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of
the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will
endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or
assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational
improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore,
some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that
those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with
a smaller, less complex organization. 

We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence
of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority
of our shareholders do not agree. 

We may be able to complete our initial business combination even though
a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder
approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant
to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors,
advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares
that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business
combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all
Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business
combination. 

34 

In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check
companies have, in the past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements.
We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments
in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our shareholders may not support. 

In order to effectuate a business combination, blank check companies have,
in the past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example,
blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, extended the time to consummate
an initial business combination, and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged
for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require a special resolution
of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least a two-thirds 2 / 3 majority (or such higher threshold as specified in the company s amended and restated articles of association) of our ordinary shares
who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, extending the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination
will require the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of our voting power that vote at a meeting, and amending our warrant agreement
will require a vote of holders of at least 50 of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private
placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, 50 of the number of the
then outstanding private placement warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require us to
provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders
of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem
100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally
change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part, we would
register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order
to effectuate our initial business combination. 

The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association that relate to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing
the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which
requires the approval of the holders of at least a two-thirds 2 / 3 majority (or such higher threshold as specified
in the company s amended and restated articles of association) of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of
the company, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It will be possible for us, therefore,
to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination
that some of our shareholders may not support. 

Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter that
prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to the rights of a company s shareholders, without
approval by a certain percentage of the company s shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires
approval by between 90 and 100 of the company s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
provide that any of its provisions related to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares (including the requirement to deposit
proceeds of our initial public offering and the placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified
circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution
under Cayman Islands law, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may
be amended if approved by holders of at least 65 of our ordinary shares provided that the provisions of our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association governing the appointment or removal of directors prior to our initial business combination may
only be amended by a special resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at our general meeting.
Our sponsor and its permitted transferees, if any, who will collectively beneficially own, on an as-converted basis, approximately 82.2 
of our outstanding ordinary shares, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we will be able to amend the provisions
of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than
some other blank check companies, and this would allow us to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders
may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 

35 

Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to
agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that
would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares
redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary
shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such
amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number
of the then-outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as
a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, officers and directors for any breach of these agreements.
As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. 

We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial
business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular
business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders
may receive only approximately 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust
account and our warrants will expire worthless. 

Although we believe that the net proceeds of our initial public offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, we cannot
ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion
of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders
who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in
connection with our initial business combination, we expect to be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business
combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment
may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable
when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that
particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial business combination
within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per public share, or less than such amount
in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not
need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth
of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or
growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection
with or after our initial business combination. 

Because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial
statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. 

The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to
a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement
disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents,
whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance
with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be
audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses
we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance
with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 

36 

Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more
difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and
costs of completing a business combination. 

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report
on our system of internal controls beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated
filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent
registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank
check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public
companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such
entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. 

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial
reports and prevent fraud. As described in Part II, Item 9A, management has concluded that, due to the material weakness we have identified
in our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. If we identify any new material
weaknesses in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our
accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may
be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable
stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result.
We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential
future material weaknesses. 

We have a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2023. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting,
we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us
and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Management concluded that there was a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 relating to the accounting for accruals. 

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial
reports and prevent fraud. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weakness. If we identify any new material weaknesses
in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts
or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable
to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange
listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot
assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future
material weaknesses. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm s report
contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As of December 31, 2023, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur
costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial
business combination will be successful. If we are unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a business
combination by November 5, 2024 then we will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date
for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements contained elsewhere in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going
concern.

Risks Relating to our Securities 

The Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange
prior to or following the consummation of an initial business combination, which could limit investors ability to make transactions
in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

Our securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq. However, we cannot assure
you that our securities will continue to be, listed on the Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order
to continue listing our securities on the Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution
and share price levels. 

On October 24, 2023, the company received written notice (the Notice from Nasdaq indicating that the company was no longer in compliance with the minimum number of round lot holders required for continued
listing on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Round Lot Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the company had a period
of 45 days to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance, which it submitted on December 5, 2023 (the Compliance Plan ),
and which was accepted by Nasdaq on December 7, 2023 (the Compliance Plan Acceptance Notice ). Pursuant to the Compliance
Plan Acceptance Notice, the company has until April 22, 2024 (the Compliance Date to regain compliance with the Round
Lot Requirement. If the company does not regain compliance with the Round Lot Requirement by the Compliance Date, the company will receive
written notification that its securities are subject to delisting, at which time the Company may appeal the Nasdaq s delisting determination
to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the Panel ). There can be no assurance that the company will be able to regain
compliance with the Round Lot Requirement or that any appeal of the Nasdaq s delisting determination to the Panel would be successful.
If the company does not regain compliance with the Round Lot Requirement by the Compliance Date, the company may also be able to transfer
the listing of its securities to the Nasdaq Capital Market, provided that the company then meets the applicable requirements for continued
listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will
be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq s continued
listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. We cannot assure you that we will be able
to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. If the Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and
we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter
market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

38 

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal
statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. 
Because our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq, our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants qualify
as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal
statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity,
then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used
these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state
securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the
sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the Nasdaq, our securities would
not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 

You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust
account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares
or warrants, potentially at a loss. 

Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those
Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption
of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to
have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete
our initial business combination by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our
Class A ordinary shares, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination by November
5, 2024, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection
with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon
the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination
by November 5, 2024, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust
account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants,
potentially at a loss. 

Because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands,
you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be
limited. 

We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands.
As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers,
or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers. 

Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the
Cayman Islands. We are also subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against
the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are
to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively
limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority,
but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors
under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United
States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states,
such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies
may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States. 

We have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts
of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the
Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although
there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will
recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the
principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment
has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be
final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands
judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of
which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held
to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought
elsewhere. 

39 

As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty
in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders
than they would as public shareholders of a United States company. 

After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority
of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States 
therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights. 

It is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority
of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States.
As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to
effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil
liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws. 

Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A
ordinary shares and could entrench management. 

Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain
provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions
include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference
shares. These provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve
payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. 

Because of the number of Class A ordinary shares received by our
sponsor upon the conversion of the founder shares, the Nasdaq may consider us to be a controlled company within the meaning
of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. 

Because of the number of Class A ordinary shares received by our sponsor
upon the conversion of the founder shares, the Nasdaq may consider us to be a controlled company within the meaning of the
Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under the Nasdaq corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50 of the voting
power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain
corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that: 

we have a board that includes a majority of independent directors, as defined under the rules of the Nasdaq; 

40 

we have a compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities; and 

director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board, by our independent directors or by a nominating committee of our board that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter or resolution addressing the committee s purpose and responsibilities. 

We do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with
the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize
some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all
of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. 

We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse
to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50 of the then-outstanding public warrants. As a result, the
exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of our Class A ordinary shares
purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval. 

Our warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between
CST, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any
holder (i) to cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description
of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this prospectus, or to cure, correct or supplement any defective provision,
or (ii) to add or change any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties
to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the interests of the registered
holders of the warrants. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants
in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the
public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment.
Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50 of the then outstanding public warrants
is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert
the warrants into cash or stock, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise
of a warrant. 

Our warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York
or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions
and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable
judicial forum for disputes with our company. 

Our warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any
action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities
Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action,
proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. 

41 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement
will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal
district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring
any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement.
If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other
than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a foreign action in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state
and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions
(an enforcement action ), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action
by service upon such warrant holder s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder. 

This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder s ability
to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively,
if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified
types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and
resources of our management and board of directors. 

A provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for
us to consummate an initial business combination. 

Unlike most blank check companies, if (i) we issue additional Class A ordinary
shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at
a Newly Issued Price of less than 9.20 per ordinary share, (ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than
60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the
consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (iii) the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise
price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 18.00
per share redemption trigger price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the higher of the Market
Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business. 

Our management s ability to require holders of our warrants
to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer Class A ordinary shares upon their exercise of the warrants
than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash. 

If we call our public warrants for redemption, our management will have
the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his warrant (including any private placement warrants) to do so on a cashless
basis. If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of Class A ordinary
shares received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrants for cash. This
will have the effect of reducing the potential upside of the holder s investment in our company. 

42 

We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at
a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. 

We have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time
after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of 0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of
our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third
trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met. We may not redeem the
warrants when a holder may not exercise such warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants
and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current
market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the
outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the
private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. 

Our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our
Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. 

We issued warrants to purchase 6,612,500 Class A ordinary shares as part
of the Units offered by our initial public offering and, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we issued in
a private placement an aggregate of 12,190,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at
 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if the sponsor, its affiliates or a member of our management team makes any working
capital loans, it may convert up to 1,500,000 of such loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 private placement warrants, at the price
of 1.00 per warrant. 

To the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to effectuate
a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of
these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase
the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the
business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of
acquiring the target business. 

We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon
exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place
when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless
basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless. 

We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise
of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement,
we have agreed that, as soon as practicable after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable
efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will use our commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants
expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent
a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus relating to our initial public offering,
the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop
order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements,
we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash
or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance
of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption
from registration is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt
from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have
no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of Units will have paid the full
unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. We may not redeem the warrants when a holder may not
exercise such warrants. However, there may be instances in which holders of our public warrants may be unable to exercise such public
warrants but holders of our private warrants may be able to exercise such private warrants. 

43 

An investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance
of Class A ordinary shares upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state
of residence of the holder of the warrants. 

No warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue Class
A ordinary shares unless the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt
under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. If the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise
of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants
may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold. 

The warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security
other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time. 

In certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in
our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares. As a result,
if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company
of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within twenty business days of the closing of an initial
business combination. 

The grant of registration rights to our sponsor may make it more
difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of
our Class A ordinary shares. 

Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection
with our initial public offering, our sponsor and its permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the Class A ordinary
shares received upon conversion of the founder shares, the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise
of the private placement warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Class A ordinary shares
issuable upon conversion of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of
such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A
ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult
to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or
ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities
owned by our sponsor or its permitted transferees are registered for resale. 

Risks Relating to the Post-Business Combination Company 

Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination,
we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative
effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of
your investment. 

Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which
we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues with a particular target business, that it would
be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business
and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets,
restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence
successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent
with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity,
the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition,
charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing
debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain
their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely
to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our
officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim
under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained
an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 

The officers and directors of an initial business combination candidate
may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of an initial business combination target s key personnel
could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

The role of an initial business combination candidate s key personnel
upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members
of an initial business combination candidate s management team will remain associated with the initial business combination candidate
following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to
remain in place and may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of an initial business combination target s
key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business
after our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications
or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 

We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business
combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100 of the outstanding equity interests or assets
of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50 
or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient
for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction
that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50 or more of the voting securities of the target,
our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company,
depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which
we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this
case, we would acquire a 100 interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary
shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares
subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single
person or group obtaining a larger share of the company s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more
likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of
control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such
business. 

44 

We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective
target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the
skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company, which could, in turn, negatively impact the value of our shareholders 
investment in us. 

When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination
with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business s management may be limited due to a lack of time,
resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect
and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business s management not possess
the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination
business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to retain their securities following the initial business
combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction
in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of
care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy
solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement
or material omission. 

Risks Related to Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries 

If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside
of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to
and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety
of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. 

If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside
of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations,
including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a
foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price
based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 

If we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would
be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the
following: 

costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations; 

rules and regulations regarding currency redemption; 

complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals; 

laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected; 

exchange listing and/or delisting requirements; 

tariffs and trade barriers, including the impact of ongoing trade wars between the United States and foreign countries; 

regulations related to customs and import/export matters; 

45 

local or regional economic policies and market conditions; 

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 

longer payment cycles; 

tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; 

currency fluctuations and exchange controls; 

rates of inflation; 

challenges in collecting accounts receivable; 

cultural and language differences; 

employment regulations; 

underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems; 

corruption; 

protection of intellectual property; 

social unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances; 

regime changes and political upheaval; 

terrorist attacks, natural disasters and wars; and 

deterioration of political relations with the United States. 

We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we
were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such combination, our operations
might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

46 

We may migrate to or merge with and into another entity in another
jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such migration or merger may result in taxes imposed on shareholders. 

We may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject
to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is
located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction
in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We
do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay such taxes. Shareholders or warrant holders may
be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation. 

We may migrate to or merge with and into another entity in another
jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future
material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights. 

In connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the
home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction
may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction
may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under
any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. 

We are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory
matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. 

We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including,
for example, the SEC, which is charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded,
and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have
resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time
and attention from seeking a business combination target. 

Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to
varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result
in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance
practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business
may be harmed. 

If our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar
with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various
regulatory issues. 

Following our initial business combination, our management may resign from
their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination
will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with United States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar
with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive
and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues, which may adversely affect our operations. 

47 

Exchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target
business ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished. 

In the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would
likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected
by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among
other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency
may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition
and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial
business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able
to consummate such transaction. 

After our initial business combination, substantially all of our
assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be derived from our operations in any such country.
Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and social conditions
and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate. 

The economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies,
of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and
among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country s economy
experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease
in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with
which to consummate our initial business combination, and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business
to become profitable. 

Risks Relating to our Management Team 

We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their
loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. 

Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals
and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers
and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are
not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their
time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
Moreover, certain of our officers and directors have time and attention requirements for investment vehicles of which Sponsor Affiliate
and its affiliates are the investment managers. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any
of our directors or officers. 

The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or
officers could have a detrimental effect on us. 

48 

Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination
and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our
initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination
business. 

Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is
dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained.
Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management, director or advisory positions following
our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we
intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment
of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated
by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. 

In addition, the officers and directors of a business combination candidate
may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination target s key personnel could
negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of a business combination candidate s
key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that
certain members of a business combination candidate s management team will remain associated with the business combination candidate
following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of a business combination candidate will not
wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements
with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned
on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial
business combination and, as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination
is the most advantageous. 

Our key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion
of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business
combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for
such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after
the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel s retention or resignation a condition
to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting
a target business. In addition, pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor,
upon and following consummation of an initial business combination, will be entitled to nominate three individuals for appointment to
our board of directors, as long as the sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration and shareholder rights agreement. 

Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to
other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict
of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not,
commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and
our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion
of our initial business combination. Certain of our executive officers are engaged in several other business endeavors for which he or
she may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours
per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers 
and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current
commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete
our initial business combination. 

49 

Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of
them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including other blank check companies,
and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 

Until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage
in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses or entities. Certain of our officers and directors presently
have, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such
officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, certain of our officers
and directors, including Michael Stern, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity
should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity
prior to its presentation to us. 

In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may in the future become
affiliated with other blank check companies that may have acquisition objectives that are similar to ours. Accordingly, they may have
conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be
resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to such other blank check companies prior to its presentation to
us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we renounce, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
our interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in any business combination opportunity which may be
a corporate opportunity for both us and our sponsor and another entity, including any entities managed by our sponsor or its affiliates
and any companies in which our sponsor or such entities have invested or about which any of our officers or directors acquires knowledge
and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. In addition, our amended and restated articles of association
contain provisions to exculpate and indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by law, such persons in respect of any liability, obligation
or duty to our company that may arise as a consequence of such persons becoming aware of any business opportunity or failing to present
such business opportunity. 

Our executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective
affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. 

We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive
officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired
or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination
with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor
do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types
conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. 

The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may
influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently,
our directors and officers discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of
interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in the company s
best interests. If this were the case, and the directors fail to act in accordance with their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman
Islands law, we may have a claim against such individuals.

General Risk Factors 

We are a recently incorporated company with no operating history
and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 

We are a recently formed company, incorporated under the laws of the Cayman
Islands, with no operating results. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve
our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We may be unable to complete
our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. 

Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates
may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us. 

Information regarding performance is presented for informational purposes
only. Any past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability
to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You
should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of the future performance
of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. Our management has no experience in operating
special purpose acquisition companies. 

Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information
theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure
and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on,
or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to
corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without
significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient
resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any
of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss. 

51 

Global or regional conditions may adversely affect our business and
our ability to consummate our initial business combination. 

Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions periodically
occur, including recession or slowing growth, changes, or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter
credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses, increases in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending. Adverse
changes in economic conditions can harm global business and adversely affect our ability to consummate our initial business combination.
Such adverse changes could result from geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political
instability, human rights concerns and terrorist activity, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and public health issues (including
the COVID-19 pandemic), supply chain interruptions, new or revised export, import or doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions
and tariffs or other global or regional occurrences. 

In particular, in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the United
States, the European Union, and several other countries are imposing far-reaching sanctions and export control restrictions on Russian
entities and individuals. This rising conflict and the resulting market volatility could adversely affect global economic, political and
market conditions. Additionally, ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas have continued to cause disruptions in the U.S. and global
economy. These and other global and regional conditions may adversely impact our business and our ability to consummate our initial business
combination. 

We may be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, 
which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors. 

If we are a PFIC within the meaning of section 1297(a) of the Code, for
any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants,
such U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status
for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception. Depending on the particular
circumstances, the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty, and there cannot be any assurance that we will
qualify for the start-up exception. Accordingly, there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable
year or any subsequent taxable year. Our PFIC status for any taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable
year. If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information
as the Internal Revenue Service may require, including a PFIC Annual Information Statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make
and maintain a qualified electing fund election within the meaning of section 1295 of the Code, but there can be no assurance
that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases.
We urge U.S. investors to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules. 

We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company
within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging
growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and
may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. 

We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the
Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being
required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result,
our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to
five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares
held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, in which case we would no longer
be an emerging growth company as of the following end of such fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities
less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance
on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading
market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

52 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies
from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not
had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act)
are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out
of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election
to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued
or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new
or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements
with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the
extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined
in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including,
among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements and, if their revenues are less than 100 million, not providing
an independent registered public accounting firm attestation on internal control over financial reporting. We will remain a smaller reporting
company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 250
million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of that year, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed
year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter
of that year. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements
with other public companies difficult or impossible. 

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 

None. 

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 

We are a special purpose acquisition company with no business operations.
Since our initial public offering, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates.
Therefore, we do not consider that we face significant cybersecurity risk and have not adopted any cybersecurity risk management program
or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity risk. Our board of directors is generally responsible for the oversight of risks from
cybersecurity threats, if any. We have not encountered any cybersecurity incidents since our initial public offering. 

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 

Our executive offices are located at 104 5 th Avenue, New York,
New York 10011, and our telephone number is (212) 974-3600. An affiliate of our sponsor provides members of our management team with office
space, secretarial and administrative services at no cost. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

To the knowledge of our management, there is no material litigation currently
pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

Our Units commenced public trading on November 2, 2021. Our Class A ordinary
shares and warrants began separate trading on December 10, 2021. 

(b) Holders 

On March 15, 2024, there was 1 holder of record of our Units, 5 holders

of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the
discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate
declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with a business combination,
our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

(f) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Use of Proceeds from
Registered Offerings 

On February 19, 2021, our sponsor paid 25,000 to cover certain of our
offering expenses on our behalf in in consideration of 10,062,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001 per share. The number of
founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20 of the total outstanding equity
after our initial public offering. Such securities were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In July 2021, our sponsor returned to us, for no consideration, an aggregate of 4,312,500
Class B ordinary shares, which we canceled, resulting in an aggregate of 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding and held by our
sponsor. In October 2021, our sponsor transferred 30,000 Class B ordinary shares to each of our independent directors. On November 2,
2021, the company issued an additional 862,500 Class B ordinary shares to the sponsor by way of the application of amounts standing to
the credit of the share premium account of the company, resulting in there being an aggregate of 6,612,500 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. 

54 

Our sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation
D under the Securities Act. The sole business of our sponsor was to act as our sponsor in connection with our initial public offering. 

On November 5, 2021, the company consummated its initial public offering
of 26,450,000 Units, which includes the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase up to an additional 3,450,000 Units to
cover over-allotments at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 264,500,000, and incurring offering costs of 16,608,500, inclusive
of 11,270,000 in deferred underwriting commissions (which amount was subsequently revised, as discussed herein). Each Unit consists of
one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class
A ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. 

Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we
consummated the private placement of 12,190,000 private placement warrants (including 690,000 private placement warrants purchased in
connection with the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) to our sponsor and BTIG, at a price of 1.00 per private
placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 12,190,000. These issuances were made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained
in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales. Each private
placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50. The private placement warrants
(including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred,
assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. 

On January 26, 2023, the holders of the company s Class B ordinary
shares, including our sponsor, converted all of their Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the conversions,
such holders will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the trust account as a result of their ownership of any Class A ordinary
shares issued upon conversion of the founder shares. 

(g) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the company s financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto
which are contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth
below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factor
Summary, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted
company on February 2, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or
similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a business combination ). We are an early stage and
emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

55 

The registration statement for our initial public offering (the IPO was declared effective on November 2, 2021 (the Effective Date ). On November 5, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 26,450,000
Units, which includes the exercise of the underwriters option to purchase up to an additional 3,450,000 Units at the IPO price
to cover over-allotments. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one public warrant, each whole public warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The
Units were sold at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 264,500,000. 

Simultaneous with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale
of the Units, we consummated the private placement of 12,190,000 private placement warrants (including 690,000 private placement warrants
purchased in connection with the exercise of the underwriter s over-allotment option) at a price of 1.00 per private placement
warrant, generating total proceeds of 12,190,000. The private placement warrants, which were purchased by our sponsor and BTIG, LLC BTIG ),
are identical to the public warrants, except that if held by the sponsor or BTIG or their permitted transferees, they are, subject to
certain limited exceptions, subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of our initial business combination.
Additionally, the private placement warrants held by BTIG are subject to the lock-up and registration rights limitations imposed by FINRA
Rule 5110 and may not be exercised after five years from November 2, 2021. 

Upon the closing of our IPO and the private placement, 269,790,000 has
been placed in the trust account, representing the redemption value of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the initial public offering,
at their redemption value of 10.20 per share. 

If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination by November
5, 2024 (the Combination Period, as extended), then we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,
(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account and not previously released to the company to pay income taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders 
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve,
subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and in all cases subject to the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions
with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless if the company fails to complete its initial business combination within the
Combination Period. 

On January 18, 2023, the company announced that it is in advanced discussions
with Helios Investment Partners about a potential business combination which would result in the creation of a new publicly listed energy
transition infrastructure platform, Helios Energy Transition Infrastructure HETI ), focused on the development of natural
gas and low-carbon energy infrastructure businesses and assets in Africa (the Proposed Transaction ). The Proposed Transaction
is expected to be valued at an Enterprise Value of approximately 1 billion, and the company is targeting completion of the merger in
the second half of 2024. There is no binding agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction, and negotiations remain subject to significant
contingencies, including the completion of due diligence, the negotiation and execution of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement,
confirmation and documentation of fully committed financing, and requisite shareholder approvals. There can be no assurances that the
company will successfully negotiate a definitive agreement, or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated. 

56 

At the First Extension Meeting on January 26, 2023, the company s
shareholders approved the First Extension Amendment Proposal and the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal. Based on the results of
the First Extension Meeting, our sponsor agreed to contribute into the trust account the lesser of (x) an aggregate of 120,000 or (y)
 0.035 per share for each public share that was not redeemed at the First Extension Meeting for each monthly period until August 7, 2023
(commencing on February 7, 2023 and ending on the 7th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed by the company
to complete its initial business combination. In connection with the approval of the First Extension Amendment Proposal, 22,239,972 Class
A ordinary shares were redeemed and 4,210,028 Class A ordinary shares were not redeemed. As a result, the aggregate monthly Contribution
payable by the sponsor to us is 120,000. 

On January 26, 2023, in connection with the First Extension Meeting, the
holders of the company s founder shares converted all of their Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding
the conversions, such holders will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the trust account as a result of their ownership of any
Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the founder shares. 

On February 7, 2023, we issued the Extension Note, evidencing the Extension
Loans. The Extension Loans are unsecured and non-interest bearing, and will be repayable by the company upon consummation of an initial
business combination. If the company does not consummate an initial business combination, the Extension Note will be repaid only from
funds held outside of the trust account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. 

On July 21, 2023, the company held the Second Extension Meeting at which
the company s shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Articles. The Second Extension Amendment Proposal amended the date by
which the company has to consummate a business combination from August 7, 2023 to February 7, 2024. 

In connection with the Second Extension Meeting, holders of 2,198,202 Class
A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.83 per share,
for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 23,802,065. As a result, such amount was removed from the trust account to pay such
holders and 2,011,826 Class A ordinary shares and 6,612,500 converted founder shares were left outstanding for a total
of 8,624,326 Class A ordinary shares outstanding. 

On October 24, 2023, the company received
the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq notifying the company that, since the company s Form 10-Q for
the period ended June 30, 2023 reported total holders below the round lot holder requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2), the
company no longer complies with Nasdaq s Listing Rules. On December 7, 2023, the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq
granted the company an extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) on or before April 22, 2024. The Notice does
not impact the listing of the Company s Class A ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market as of
the date of filing this Annual Report. 

On November 3, 2023, we entered into the Restated Note increasing the aggregate
principal amount of the Extension Note to 1,470,000. The Restated Note may be drawn down by us from time to time prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination. The Restated Note does not bear interest, matures on the date of consummation of the initial business
combination and is subject to customary events of default. As of December 31, 2023, the company has an outstanding balance of 1,385,000
under the Restated Note. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased an aggregate of 720,000 in investments in the trust account
from the monthly Extension Loans. 

On January 29, 2024, the company held the Third Extension Meeting at which
the company s shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Articles. The Third Extension Amendment Proposal amended the date by
which the company has to consummate a business combination from February 7, 2024 to November 5, 2024. 

In connection with the vote to approve the Third Extension Amendment Proposal,
holders of 678,865 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately
 11.13 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 7.6 million. As a result, approximately 7,553,041 will be removed
from the Trust Account to pay such holders and 1,332,961 Class A ordinary shares (excluding 6,612,500 converted founder shares) remain
outstanding, for a total of 7,945,461 shares outstanding. 

Results of Operations 

As of December 31, 2023, we have not commenced any operations. All activity
for the period from February 2, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023, relates to our formation and IPO, and, since the completion
of our IPO, searching for a target to consummate an initial business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from
the proceeds derived from our IPO and placed in the trust account. 

57 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net income of 218,071,
which consisted of interest earned on cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of 2,470,446, partially offset by operating
costs of 2,252,375. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we
had a net income of 2,049,648, which consisted of interest earned on cash and marketable securities held
in the trust account of 3,749,825 offset by operating costs of 1,700,177. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, net
cash used in operating activities was 998,361. Net income of 218,071 was affected by interest earned on cash and marketable securities
held in the trust account of 2,470,446. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 1,254,014 in cash for operating activities. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities
was 404,183. Net income of 2,049,648 was affected by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of 3,749,825.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 1,295,994 of cash for operating activities. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had cash outside our trust account of 44,165,
available for working capital needs. All remaining cash was held in the trust account and is generally unavailable for our use, prior
to an initial business combination. 

On January 26, 2023, in connection with the First Extension Meeting, holders
of 22,239,972 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.36
per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of 230,611,860. As a result, such amount was removed from the trust account on February
1, 2023 to pay the redeeming holders and 4,210,028 Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding (excluding 6,612,500 Class B ordinary
shares converted into Class A ordinary shares on January 26, 2023, which do not entitle their holders to any monies held in
the trust account as a result of their ownership). The remaining amount in the trust account immediately following the redemption payments
was 42,927,964. 

In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs
in connection with a business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). If we complete a business combination, we
may repay such Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that a business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such Working Capital Loans, but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into
warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant, at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.
As of December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 

On February 7, 2023, we issued the Extension
Note, evidencing the Extensions Loans, pursuant to which the sponsor deposited monthly principal amounts of 120,000 into the trust account
from February 7, 2023 until August 7, 2023. 

On November 3, 2023, we entered into the
Restated Note to increase the aggregate principal amount of the Extension Note to 1,470,000. Amounts drawn down under the Restated Note
 will be repayable by the company upon consummation
of an initial business combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination by November
5, 2024, the Restated Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the trust
account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Restated
Note may be drawn down by us from time to time prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. The Restated Note does not
bear interest, matures on the date of consummation the business combination and is subject to customary events of default. As of December
31, 2023, the company has an outstanding balance of 1,385,000 under the Restated Note. 

We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet
the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient
funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either
to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation
of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination.
Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our
business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we
will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is
insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 

58 

The company is within 12 months of its mandatory liquidation as of the
date of filing this Annual Report. In connection with the company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, the mandatory liquidation raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going
concern until the earlier of the consummation of the business combination or the date the company is required to liquidate.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13
 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU
2016-13 . This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected
to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Since June 2016, the
FASB issued clarifying updates to the new standard including changing the effective date for smaller reporting companies. The guidance
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption
permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on its financial
statements. 

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective,
accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the company s financial statements.

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains
provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging
growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective
date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as
a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required
for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised
accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying
on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as
an emerging growth company , we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide
an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies
under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the report of independent registered public
accounting firm providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv)
disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons
of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five
years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever
is earlier. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective
of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

61 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective.
Management has identified a material weakness in internal controls related to the accounting for accruals. While we have processes to
identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements, we plan to continue to enhance our system of evaluating and implementing
the accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including through enhanced analyses by our personnel and third-party
professionals with whom we consult regarding the accounting for accruals. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished
over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
at December 31, 2023. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria,
management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. 

Management has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control
over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with
whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training
to supplement existing accounting professionals. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

We currently have five directors. Our board of directors is divided into
three classes, with only one class of directors being appointed in each year, and with each class (except for those directors appointed
prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In accordance with the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements,
we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the Nasdaq.
The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Mr. Lehmann, will expire at our first annual general meeting. The term
of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Ms. Kertesz and Mr. Neto, will expire at our second annual general meeting.
The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Mr. Neuhauser and Mr. Stern, will expire at our third annual general
meeting. Incumbent directors have the ability to appoint additional directors or to appoint replacement directors in the event of a casual
vacancy. 

Pursuant to an agreement entered into in connection with our initial public
offering, our sponsor, upon and following consummation of an initial business combination, will be entitled to nominate three individuals
for appointment to our board of directors, as long as the sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration and shareholder rights
agreement. 

Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion
of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint officers in accordance
with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association provide that our officers may consist of one or more chairman of the board, chief executive officer, president,
chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

65 

Director Independence 

The Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors
be independent. Our board of directors has determined that Ana Kertesz, Michael Lehmann, Edmar Prado Lopes Neto and Adrian Neuhauser are
 independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled
meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee;
a nominating committee; and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule
10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. We are relying
on the phase-in rules with respect to the independence of the members of our Audit Committee. Subject to the phase-in rules and a limited
exception, the rules of Nasdaq require that the nominating and compensation committees of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors, or, if there is no nominating committee, that director nominations be made, or recommended to the full board, by our independent
directors. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board of directors and has the composition and responsibilities
described below. The charter of each committee is available on our website. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Messrs.
Lehmann, Neto and Kertesz serve as members of our audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are
required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Our board of directors has determined
that each of Messrs. Lehmann, Neto and Kertesz are independent under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Mr. Neto serves
as the chairman of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined
that Mr. Neto qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal
functions of the audit committee, including: 

meeting with our independent registered public accounting firm regarding, among other issues, audits, and adequacy of our accounting and control systems; 

monitoring the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm; 

verifying the rotation of the lead (or coordinating) audit partner having primary responsibility for the audit and the audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit as required by law; 

inquiring and discussing with management our compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

66 

pre-approving all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed; 

appointing or replacing the independent registered public accounting firm; 

determining the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work; 

establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; 

monitoring compliance on a quarterly basis with the terms of our initial public offering and, if any noncompliance is identified, immediately taking all action necessary to rectify such noncompliance or otherwise causing compliance with the terms of our initial public offering; and 

reviewing and approving all payments made to our existing shareholders, executive officers or directors and their respective affiliates. Any payments made to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. 

Nominating Committee 

We have established a nominating committee of our board of directors. The
members of our nominating committee are Mr. Neto and Mr. Lehmann, and Mr. Neto serves as chairman of the nominating committee. Under the
Nasdaq listing standards, our director nominations must be made, or recommended to the full board, by our independent directors or by
a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. Our board of directors has determined that each of Mr. Neto
and Mr. Lehmann are independent under the Nasdaq listing standards. 

The nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of
persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee considers persons identified by its members, management,
shareholders, investment bankers and others. 

Guidelines for Selecting Director Nominees 

The guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in a charter
adopted by us, generally provide that persons to be nominated: 

should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business, education or public service; 

should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make a significant contribution to the board of directors and bring a range of skills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and 

should have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism and intense dedication to serving the interests of the shareholders. 

67 

The nominating committee will consider a number of qualifications relating
to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person s candidacy for membership
on the board of directors. The nominating committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience,
to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain
a broad and diverse mix of board members. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and
other persons. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation committee of the board of directors.
The members of our compensation committee are Ms. Kertesz and Mr. Neto, and Mr. Neto serves as chairman of the compensation committee. 

Under the Nasdaq listing standards, we are required to have at least two
members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent directors, subject to certain phase-in rules. Our board of directors
has determined that each of Ms. Kertesz and Mr. Neto are independent under the Nasdaq listing standards. We adopted a compensation committee
charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s, President s, Chief Financial Officer s and General Counsel s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other Section 16 executive officers; 

reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and/or annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement, to the extent required; and 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

68 

The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole
discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor and will be directly responsible
for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such advisor. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation
consultant, external legal counsel or any other advisor, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such advisor,
including the factors required by the Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has
not served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any
entity that has one or more officers serving on our board of directors. 

Advisory Board 

From time to time, we may utilize the services of certain advisors and/or
form an advisory board consisting of individuals whom we believe will help us execute our business strategy. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers
and employees. A copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments
to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K or on the company s website to the extent
required by SEC rules. 

Conflicts of Interest 

Under Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary
duties: 

duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole; 

duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose; 

directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion; 

duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of shareholders; 

duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and 

duty to exercise independent judgment. 

69 

In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not
fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge,
skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in
relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience of that director. As set out above, directors have a duty not to
put themselves in a position of conflict, and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing or to otherwise benefit as a result of
their position. However, in some instances, what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance
by the shareholders, provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in
the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings. 

Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in
the future may have, additional fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including JDS Development Group. As a result, if any
of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has
then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then he or she may be required to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to
present such business combination opportunity to such entity before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to
pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our
ability to complete our initial business combination. To address the matters set out above, our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association provide that we renounce, to the maximum extent permitted by law, our interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in any business combination opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and our sponsor and
another entity, including any entities managed by our sponsor or its affiliates and any companies in which our sponsor or such entities
have invested or about which any of our officers or directors acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may
have in respect thereof. In addition, our amended and restated articles of association will contain provisions to exculpate and indemnify,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, such persons in respect of any liability, obligation or duty to our company that may arise as
a consequence of such persons becoming aware of any business opportunity or failing to present such business opportunity.

and directors currently have fiduciary duties, contractual obligations or other material management relationships:

Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential
conflicts of interest: 

Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Certain of our executive officers are engaged in several other business endeavors for which he or she may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. 

Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Except as described herein, our sponsor and our directors and executive officers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earliest of (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination and (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, (x) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Except as described herein, the private placement warrants will not be transferable until 30 days following the completion of our initial business combination. Because each of our officers and directors will own ordinary shares or warrants directly or indirectly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. 

Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment mandates. 

71 

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with
a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination
with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors,
will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent valuation, appraisal
or accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Management may also recuse
themselves from investment discussions of companies that are affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. 

JDS Development Group and its affiliates manage several investment vehicles.
Investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these investment
vehicles decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated
within JDS Development Group, including by Michael Stern and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for
both us and for current or future investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates and may be directed to such investment
vehicles rather than to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. Neither JDS Development Group nor members of our management team who
are also employed by JDS Development Group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination
of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or managing directors of JDS Development Group. 

JDS Development Group and/or our management, in their capacities as officers
or managing directors of JDS Development Group or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the
related entities described above, current or future investment vehicles managed by JDS Development Group or its affiliates, or third parties,
before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. In addition, JDS Development Group or its affiliates
may sponsor other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and
members of our management team may participate in such blank check companies. 

Furthermore, in no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers
or directors, or their respective affiliates, be paid by us any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or
for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination. Further, an affiliate of our
sponsor has agreed to provide members of our management team with office space, secretarial and administrative services at no cost. 

We cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be
resolved in our favor. 

If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business
combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law. In such case, our sponsor and each member
of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. 

Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company s
memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision
may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default,
willful neglect, actual fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred
in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We have entered into agreements
with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association. We have purchased a policy of directors and officers liability insurance
that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures
us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 

72 

Our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind
they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust
account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds from the trust account due to their ownership of public
shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of
the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. 

Our indemnification obligations may discourage shareholders from bringing
a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing
the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise
benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs
of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. We believe that these
provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors. 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Officer and Director Compensation 

None of our executive officers or directors have received any cash compensation
for services rendered to us. Commencing on November 2, 2021 and through the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination
and our liquidation, an affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to provide members of our management team with office space, secretarial and
administrative services at no cost. In addition, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or their respective affiliates will be
reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that
were made by us to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination
will be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not
expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our activities on our behalf in connection with identifying and consummating an initial
business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting
fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or their respective affiliates, prior to completion
of our initial business combination. In October 2021, our sponsor transferred 30,000 Class B ordinary shares to independent directors
Lehmann, Kertesz and Neto. In January 2023, Messrs. Lehman, Kertesz and Neto converted all of their Class B ordinary shares to Class A
ordinary shares. After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with
us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to
the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with
a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company
to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business
combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation.
Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination,
either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board
of directors. 

73 

We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management
team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or
all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business
combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence
our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business, but we do not believe that the ability of our management
to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with
any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon
termination of employment. 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership
of our ordinary shares as of March 15, 2024 based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial

In the table below, percentage ownership is based on 7,945,461 Class A
ordinary shares outstanding as of March 15, 2024. The table below does not include the Class A ordinary shares underlying the private
placement warrants held by our sponsor because these securities are not exercisable within 60 days of this Report.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Founder Shares 

On February 19, 2021, our sponsor paid 25,000 to cover certain offering
costs of the company in consideration for 10,062,500 founder shares. On July 2, 2021, our sponsor surrendered 4,312,500 Class B ordinary
shares to the company for no consideration resulting in 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares outstanding and held by our sponsor. In October
2021, our sponsor transferred 30,000 founder shares to each of the company s independent directors. On November 2, 2021, the company
issued an additional 862,500 Class B ordinary shares to the sponsor by way of the application of amounts standing to the credit of the
share premium account of the company, resulting in there being an aggregate of 6,612,500 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. On January
26, 2023, the holders of the founder shares converted all of the founder shares into Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the conversions,
such holders will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the trust account as a result of their ownership of any Class A ordinary
shares issued upon conversion of the founder shares. 

75 

With certain limited exceptions, the Class A ordinary shares issued upon
conversion of the founder shares will not be transferable or assignable by our sponsor until the earlier of: (A) one year after the completion
of the initial business combination or (B) subsequent to the initial business combination, (x) if the closing price of the Class
A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations
and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial business combination,
or (y) the date on which the company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all
of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 

Our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed (i) to waive
their redemption rights with respect to any shares held by it in connection with the completion of the company s initial business
combination, (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that
would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares
redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination by November 5, 2024 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary
shares and (iii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if the company
fails to complete the initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 

Private Placement Warrants 

Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering and exercise
of the over-allotment option by the underwriters, we consummated the private placement of 12,190,000 private placement warrants to our
sponsor at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 12,190,000. Each private placement warrant is
exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share. 

Other Transactions With Our Sponsor 

If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination
opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations,
he or she may be required honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity
before we can pursue such opportunity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations
that may take priority over their duties to us. 

We currently maintain our executive offices at 104 5 th Avenue,
New York, New York 10011. An affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to provide members of our management team with office space, secretarial
and administrative services at no cost. 

76 

No compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees,
will be paid to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection
with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors
or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling
on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. Our sponsor agreed
to loan us an aggregate of up to 300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of our initial public offering. The loan was non-interest
bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the closing of our initial public offering. As of November 17, 2021,
the company had an outstanding balance of 104,808 under the promissory note. The promissory note from our sponsor was paid in full on
November 18, 2021. 

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are
not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out
of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used
for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the
lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe
third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust
account. 

On February 7, 2023, we issued the Extension Note, evidencing the Extension
Loans, pursuant to which the sponsor deposited monthly principal amounts of 120,000 into the trust account from February 7, 2023 through
August 7, 2023. 

On November 3, 2023, we entered into the Restated Note to increase the
aggregate principal amount of the Extension Note to 1,470,000. Amounts drawn down under the Restated Note will be repayable by the company 

 upon consummation of an initial business combination. If we do not consummate
an initial business combination by November 5, 2024, the Restated Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the trust account
or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Restated Note may be drawn down by us from time to time prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination. The Restated Note does not bear interest, matures on the date of consummation the initial business
combination and is subject to customary events of default. As of December 31, 2023, the company has an outstanding balance of 1,385,000
under the Restated Note. 

After our initial business combination, members of our management team
who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed
to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time
of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination
business to determine executive and director compensation. 

We have entered into a registration rights and shareholder rights agreement
pursuant to which our sponsor is entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the private placement warrants, the warrants
issuable upon conversion of working capital loans (if any), and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and
upon conversion of the founder shares, and, upon consummation of our initial business combination, to nominate three individuals for election
to our board of directors, as long as the sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration and shareholder rights agreement. 

77 

Related Party Policy 

Our audit committee has adopted a charter, providing for the review, approval
and/or ratification of related party transactions, which are those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item
404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit committee shall be provided with the
details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions
that the company has already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to the company
and to the relevant related party. Any member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the
committee shall abstain from voting on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the
committee, participate in some or all of the committee s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review
of the related party transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction. 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 

The following is a summary of fees paid to Marcum for services rendered. 

Audit Fees . Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services
rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements, reviews of our quarterly financial statements and services that are normally
provided by our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. The aggregate fees
billed by Marcum for audit fees, inclusive of required filings with the SEC for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled 113,300
and 82,400, respectively. 

Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for
assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our year-end financial statements
and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation
and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We did not pay Marcum any audit-related fees during the years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Tax Fees . Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services
relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. The aggregate fees billed by Marcum for tax fees were 12,875 and 11,330 for
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

All Other Fees . All other fees consist of fees billed for all other
services. We did not pay Marcum any other fees during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Pre-Approval Policy 

Our audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our IPO. As a result,
the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit
committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit
committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including
the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved
by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
Onyx Acquisition Co. I 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Onyx Acquisition Co.
I (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit
and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph -- Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company that was formed for the purpose of completing
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or
more businesses or entities on or before November 5, 2024. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary
approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete any business combination prior
to November 5, 2024, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond
November 5, 2024 and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline
to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2021 .

or more businesses or entities (the
 Business Combination ). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to
all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations.
All activity for the period from February 2, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2023 relates to the Company s formation, initial
public offering IPO ), which is described below, and the search for a target with which to consummate a Business Combination.
The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest.
The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account (as defined
below). The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

Sponsor and Financing 

The Company s sponsor is Onyx Acquisition Sponsor Co. LLC, a Cayman
Islands limited liability company (the Sponsor ). 

On November 5, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of units
(the Units ). Each Unit consists of Class A ordinary share, par value per share (the Class A ordinary
shares and, shares thereof sold in the IPO, the Public Shares ), and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the Public
Warrants ), each whole Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of
 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at an offering price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds of . 

Simultaneous with the consummation of the IPO and the issuance and sale
of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement of private placement warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of . The Private Placement Warrants, which were
purchased by the Sponsor and BTIG, LLC BTIG ), are identical to the Public Warrants, except that if held by the Sponsor
or BTIG or their permitted transferees, they are, subject to certain limited exceptions, subject to transfer restrictions until days
following the consummation of the Company s initial Business Combination. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants held by BTIG
are subject to the lock-up and registration rights limitations imposed by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Rule 5110 and may not
be exercised after years from November 2, 2021. 

Upon the closing of the IPO and the private placement, has
been placed in a trust account (the Trust Account ), representing the redemption value of the Class A ordinary shares sold
in the IPO, at their redemption value of per share. 

F-7 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the
specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net
proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. Nasdaq rules provide that the Business Combination
must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the value of the assets held
in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at
the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will
be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

Upon the closing of the IPO and the simultaneous private placement, a total
of , consisting of per Unit sold in the IPO and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants,
was placed in the Trust Account located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and
invested only in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to an investment management trust agreement, the
trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments,
and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses
in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), the Company intends to avoid being deemed an investment company 
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The IPO was not intended for persons seeking a return on investments in government securities
or investment securities. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the
completion of the initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder
vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of
the Company s obligation to provide holders of the Class A ordinary shares (the Public Shareholders the right to
have their shares redeemed in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does
not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (B) with respect to any other provision
relating to the rights of holders of the Class A ordinary shares; or (iii) absent the completing an initial Business Combination within
the Combination Period, the return of the funds held in the Trust Account to the Public Shareholders as part of the redemption of the
Public Shares. If the Company does not invest the proceeds as discussed above, the Company may be deemed to be subject to the Investment
Company Act. If the Company is deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens
would require additional expenses for which the Company has not allotted funds and may hinder the ability to complete a Business Combination.
If the Company has not consummated the initial Business Combination within the required time period, the Public Shareholders may receive
only approximately per Public Share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of the Trust Account,
and the warrants will expire worthless. To avoid being considered an Investment Company, in November 2023, funds in the Trust Account
were placed in a demand deposit account. 

The Company will provide its Public Shareholders with the opportunity to
redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting
called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based
on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the Company to seek
shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their
Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account. 

F-8 

The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Shareholders who redeem
their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed
in Note 4). These Public Shares were classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities
from Equity. 

Recent Developments 

On January 18, 2023, the Company issued a
press release announcing that it is in advanced discussions with Helios Investment Partners about a potential business combination which
would result in the creation of a new publicly listed energy transition infrastructure platform, Helios Energy Transition Infrastructure HETI ), focused on the development of natural gas and low-carbon energy infrastructure businesses and assets in Africa (the
 Proposed Transaction ). 

The Proposed Transaction is expected to be valued at an Enterprise Value
of approximately billion, and the Company is targeting completion of the merger in the first half of 2024 .
There is no binding agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction, and negotiations remain subject to significant contingencies,
including the completion of due diligence, the negotiation and execution of a mutually acceptable definitive agreement, confirmation and
documentation of fully committed financing, and requisite shareholder approvals. There can be no assurances that the Company will successfully
negotiate a definitive agreement, or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated. 

The Company will have only until November 5, 2024 to consummate an initial
Business Combination (the Combination Period ), as noted per the extension on January 29, 2024. If the Company fails to consummate
an initial Business Combination during the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes, if any (less up to of interest to pay dissolution
expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders 
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the board of directors, liquidate and dissolve,
subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and in all cases subject to the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions
with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the
Combination Period. 

On January 26, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary
general meeting of shareholders (the January Meeting at which the Company s shareholders approved two proposals to
amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Articles ). The first proposal
extended the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 5, 2023 to
August 7, 2023 the First Extension Amendment Proposal ). The second proposal removed the limitation
that the Company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares included as part of the units sold in its initial public offering (including
any shares issued in exchange thereof) to the extent that such redemption would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less
than (the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal ). The Extension Amendment Proposal and Redemption Limitation
Amendment Proposal are described in more detail in the definitive proxy statement of the Company, which was filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC on December 8, 2022 (the Proxy Statement ), as supplemented to date. 

On January 26, 2023, based on the results
of the January Meeting, the holders of the Company s outstanding Class B ordinary shares (the founder shares converted
all of the founder shares into Class A ordinary shares . Notwithstanding the
conversions, such holders will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of their ownership of any Class
A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the founder shares. 

In connection with the January Meeting, holders
of Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 
per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of . As a result, such amount was removed from the Trust Account on February
1, 2023 to pay the redeeming holders and Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding (excluding Class B ordinary shares
(the founder shares converted into Class A ordinary shares on January 26, 2023, which do not entitle their holders to any
monies held in the Trust Account as a result of their ownership). The remaining amount in the Trust Account immediately following the
redemption payments was . 

The Sponsor agreed to contribute (each 
 such contribution, a Contribution into the trust account of the Company (such trust account,
the Trust Account the lesser of (x) an aggregate of or (y) per share for each public share that was not
redeemed at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of the Company held January 26, 2023 (the Meeting for each
monthly period until August 7, 2023 (commencing on February 7, 2023 and ending on the 7th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof,
that is needed by the Company to complete its initial Business Combination. 

On February 7, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note in the principal
amount of up to to the Sponsor (the Extension Note ), evidencing the Company s indebtedness with respect to
the Contributions (the Extension Loans ). The Extension Loans are unsecured and non-interest bearing, and will be repayable
by the Company upon consummation of an initial Business Combination. If the Company does not consummate an initial Business Combination
by November 5, 2024, the Extension Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated
or otherwise forgiven. 

On July 21, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary
general meeting of shareholders (the July Meeting at which the Company s shareholders approved a proposal to amend
the Articles. The proposal amended the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from August 7, 2023 to February
7, 2024 (the Second Extension Amendment Proposal ). 

In connection with the July Meeting, holders
of Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 
per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of . As a result, such amount was removed from the Trust Account to pay such
holders and Class A ordinary shares and converted founder shares remain outstanding for a total of Class
A ordinary shares outstanding. 

On October 24, 2023, the Company received a written notice (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq notifying the Company that, since the
Company s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2023 reported total holders below the round lot holder requirement under Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5450(a)(2), the Company no longer complies with Nasdaq s Listing Rules. On December 7, 2023, the Listing Qualifications
Department of the Nasdaq granted the Company an extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(2) on or before April
22, 2024. The Notice does not impact the listing of the Company s Class A ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market at this time . 

On November 3, 2023, the Company amended and
restated the Extension Note (hereinafter, the Restated Note increasing the aggregate principal amount to . The
Restated Note may be drawn down by the Company form time to time prior to the consummation of an initial Business Combination. The Restated

On January 29, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting
of shareholders (the January 2024 Meeting at which the Company s shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Articles.
The proposal extended the date by which the Company has to consummate a Business Combination from February 7, 2024 to November 5, 2024

Amendment Proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposals ).

The Sponsor and each member of the Company s management team have
agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares (as defined below), (ii) waive their redemption rights
with respect to their Founder Shares and any Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to
the Company s Articles (A) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide Public Shareholders
the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem of the Public Shares if
the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision
relating to the rights of Public Shareholders and, (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect
to their Founder Shares if the Company fails to consummate an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (although they
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fail to
complete the initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame), and (iv) vote any Founder Shares held by them and any Public
Shares purchased after the IPO (including in the open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of the initial Business Combination. 

The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to

the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts
in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust
Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than per Public Share due to reductions in the value of
the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay the Company s tax obligations, provided that such
liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to
seek access to the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims.

Russian Federation and Ukraine, the military action between Hamas and Israel and the risk of escalations of other military conflicts have

unsecured promissory note from the Sponsor of , which was paid in full on November 18, 2021 (see Note 4). In addition, in order
to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or their
affiliates may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans, as defined below (see Note 4). As of December 31,
2023, there were amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 

Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company may not have
sufficient working capital to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing.
Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective
initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

The Company is within months of its mandatory liquidation as of the
date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance
with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, the mandatory liquidation raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or November 5, 2024, the date the Company is required to liquidate. 

These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

The carrying value, gross unrealized holding loss and fair value of held-to-maturity
securities on December 31, 2022 are as follows:

the Company was not exposed to significant risks on such account.

The fair value of the Company s financial assets and liabilities
reflects management s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid
in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection
with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained
from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price
assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs
and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: 

Level 1 Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not being
applied. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these
securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level 2 Valuations based on (i) quoted prices in active markets
for similar assets and liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets, (iii) inputs
other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities, or (iv) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market
through correlation or other means. 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant
to the overall fair value measurement. 

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for
interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals
or material deviation from its position. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
will materially change over the next twelve months. 

There is currently taxation imposed on income by the Government of the
Cayman Islands. In accordance with federal income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company, but rather on the individual
owners. United States U.S. taxation would occur on the individual owners if certain tax elections are made by U.S. owners
and the Company were treated as a passive foreign investment company. Additionally, U.S. taxation could occur to the Company itself if
the Company is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The Company is not expected to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business at
this time. 

Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the Units
in the IPO contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation,
if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to
the Company s Articles. In accordance with the SEC s and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which
has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject
to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Public Shares have been classified outside of permanent equity. 

In connection with the approval of the Extension
Amendment Proposals, holders of Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash for an aggregate
redemption amount of . 

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they
occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period.
Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital
and accumulated deficit. 

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the changes in Class A
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are as follows:

A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants was added
to the proceeds from the IPO to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination

and officers with respect to any Founder Shares.

promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of up to to the Sponsor (the Extension Note and the Sponsor deposited
monthly principal amounts of into the Trust Account from February 7, 2023 through August 7 2023. 

On November 3, 2023, the Company amended and restated the Extension Note
(hereinafter, the Restated Note increasing the aggregate principal amount to . Amounts drawn down under the Restated
Note will be repayable by the Company upon consummation of an initial Business Combination. If the Company does not consummate an initial
Business Combination by November 5, 2024, the Restated Note will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be
forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Restated Note may be drawn down by the Company from time to time prior to the consummation
of the Company s initial Business Combination. The Restated Note does not bear interest, matures on the date of consummation the

Related Party Loans 

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination,
the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan

would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. In the event that a Business Combination
does not close, the Company may use a portion of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no
proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to of such Working Capital Loans may
be convertible into warrants at a price of per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private
Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such Working Capital Loans by our
officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such Working Capital Loans. Except
for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. To date, the Company has no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

The underwriters are entitled to deferred underwriting commissions of

The deferred underwriting commissions will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the
event that the Company completes an initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement entered into in connection
with the IPO. 

On March 1, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the underwriting
agreement relating to its IPO where the underwriters have agreed to reduce the commission payable from to upon
the closing of the proposed Business Combination and the forfeiture of Founder Shares to the Company. Upon the Closing, the
deferred underwriting commissions will be paid to the underwriters as follows based on the percentage of redemptions of Class A ordinary

On January 26, 2023, the holders of the Company s outstanding Founder
Shares converted all of the Founder Shares into Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the conversions, such holders will not be entitled
to receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of their ownership of any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of
the Founder Shares. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were and non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares issued
and outstanding, respectively. 

Class B ordinary shares The Company is authorized
to issue Class B ordinary shares with a par value of per share. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were and
 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, respectively. 

Ordinary shareholders of record are entitled to vote for each share
held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Holders of the Class A ordinary shares and holders of the Class B ordinary shares
will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law. 

Warrants Public Warrants may only be exercised for
a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will
trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 
months from the closing of the IPO; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them
is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state
of residence of the holder. 

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares
pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement
under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating
thereto is current, subject to satisfying its obligations described below with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration
is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any Class A ordinary shares to holders
seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under
the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available. 

Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding
warrants: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per warrant; 

upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption; and 

if, and only if, the last reported sale price (the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

F-18 

The Company will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current
prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the -day redemption period, except if the warrants may
be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Company may not
redeem the warrants when a holder may not exercise such warrants. 

If the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management
will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event,
each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between
the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair
market value means the average reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares for the five trading days ending on the
 third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. 

The exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise
of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization,
reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of Class
A ordinary shares at a price below their respective exercise prices. 

In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares
or equity-linked securities in connection with the closing of an initial Business Combination at a Newly Issued Price (as defined below)
of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s
board of directors, and in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates, without taking into
account any Founder Shares held by them prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds
from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of an initial
Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted
average trading price of the Company s Class A ordinary share during the trading day period starting on the trading day after
the day on which the Company completes a Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, then
the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of (i) the Market Value or
(ii) the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent)
to be equal to of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the Newly Issued Price. 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except
that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not
be transferable, assignable or salable until days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. 

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had Public Warrants
and Private Placement Warrants outstanding.

CLAWBACK POLICY 

 Onyx Acquisition Co. I 

 PURPOSE 

 Onyx Acquisition Co. I
(the Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain
a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy.
The Company s Board of Directors (the Board has therefore adopted this policy, which provides for the recoupment
of certain executive compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements
due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws (this Policy ).
This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
the rules promulgated thereunder, and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company s securities
are listed. 

 ADMINISTRATION 

 This Policy shall be administered
by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee ). Any determinations made by the Compensation
Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 

 COVERED EXECUTIVES 

 This Policy applies to
the Company s current and former executive officers (as determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with Section 10D
of the Exchange Act, the rules promulgated thereunder, and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company s
securities are listed) and such other senior executives or employees who may from time to time be deemed subject to this Policy by the
Compensation Committee (collectively, the Covered Executives ). This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against
all Covered Executives. 

 RECOUPMENT; ACCOUNTING RESTATEMENT 

 In the event that the Company
is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company s material noncompliance with any
financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement (i) to correct an error in previously
issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement
if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (each an Accounting Restatement ),
the Compensation Committee will reasonably promptly require reimbursement or forfeiture of the Overpayment (as defined below) received
by any Covered Executive (x) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (y) who served as a Covered Executive at any time during
the performance period for the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below), and (z) during the three (3) completed fiscal
years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and any transition period (that
results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three (3) completed fiscal years. 

 INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION 

 For purposes of this Policy,
 Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon
the attainment of a financial reporting measure, including, but not limited to: (i) non-equity incentive plan awards that are earned solely
or in part by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal; (ii) bonuses paid from a bonus pool, where the size of the pool
is determined solely or in part by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal; (iii) other cash awards based on satisfaction
of a financial reporting measure performance goal; (iv) restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights,
and performance share units that are granted or vest solely or in part based on satisfaction of a financial reporting measure performance
goal; and (v) proceeds from the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or vested solely or in part based
on satisfaction of a financial reporting measure performance goal. 

 Compensation that would
not be considered Incentive-Based Compensation includes, but is not limited to: (i) salaries; (ii) bonuses paid solely based on satisfaction
of subjective standards, such as demonstrating leadership, and/or completion of a specified employment period; (iii) non-equity incentive
plan awards earned solely based on satisfaction of strategic or operational measures; (iv) wholly time-based equity awards; and (v) discretionary
bonuses or other compensation that is not paid from a bonus pool that is determined by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance
goal. 

 A financial reporting measure
is: (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing financial statements,
or any measure derived wholly or in part from such measure, such as revenues, EBITDA, or net income or (ii) stock price and total shareholder
return. Financial reporting measures include, but are not limited to: revenues; net income; operating income; profitability of one or
more reportable segments; financial ratios (e.g., accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover rates); net assets or net asset
value per share; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations;
liquidity measures (e.g., working capital, operating cash flow); return measures (e.g., return on invested capital, return on assets);
earnings measures (e.g., earnings per share); sales per square foot or same store sales, where sales is subject to an accounting restatement;
revenue per user, or average revenue per user, where revenue is subject to an accounting restatement; cost per employee, where cost is
subject to an accounting restatement; any of such financial reporting measures relative to a peer group, where the Company s financial
reporting measure is subject to an accounting restatement; and tax basis income. 

OVERPAYMENT: AMOUNT SUBJECT TO RECOVERY 

 The amount to be recovered
will be the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would
have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid (the Overpayment ).
Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the financial reporting
measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the vesting, payment or grant of the incentive-based
compensation occurs after the end of that period. 

 For
Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is
not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement, the amount must be based on a reasonable
estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation
was received, and the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation
to the exchange on which the Company s securities are listed. 

 METHOD OF RECOUPMENT 

 The Compensation Committee
will determine, in its sole discretion, the method or methods for recouping any Overpayment hereunder which may include, without limitation: 

requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid; 

seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition
of any equity-based awards granted as Incentive-Based Compensation; 

offsetting any or all of the Overpayment from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered
Executive; 

cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or 

taking any other remedial or recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 

LIMITATION ON RECOVERY; NO ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS 

 The
right to recovery will be limited to Overpayments received during the three (3) completed fiscal years prior to the date on which the
Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s
fiscal year) within or immediately following those three (3) completed fiscal years. In no event shall the Company be required to award
Covered Executives an additional payment if the restated or accurate financial results would have resulted in a higher Incentive-Based
Compensation payment. 

 NO INDEMNIFICATION 

 The Company shall not indemnify
any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive-Based Compensation. 

 INTERPRETATION 

 The Compensation Committee
is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration
of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of
the Exchange Act and the applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange
on which the Company s securities are listed. 

 EFFECTIVE
DATE 

 This Policy shall be effective
as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the Effective Date and shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation (including
Incentive-Based Compensation granted pursuant to arrangements existing prior to the Effective Date). 

 AMENDMENT; TERMINATION 

 The Board may amend this
Policy from time to time in its discretion. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. 

 OTHER RECOUPMENT RIGHTS 

 The
Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Compensation Committee may require that any employment
or service agreement, cash-based bonus plan or program, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after the adoption
of this Policy shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms
of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment
that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement,
cash-based bonus plan or program, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. 

 IMPRACTICABILITY 

 The Compensation Committee
shall recover any Overpayment in accordance with this Policy except to the extent that the Compensation Committee determines such recovery
would be impracticable because: 

 (A) The direct expense
paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; 

 (B) Recovery would violate
home country law of the Company where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; or 

 (C) Recovery would likely
cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet
the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 

 SUCCESSORS 

 This Policy shall be binding
and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
