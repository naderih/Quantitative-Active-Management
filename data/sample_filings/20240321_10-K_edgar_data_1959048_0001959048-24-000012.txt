Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of 
 Ford Motor Credit Company LLC 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the asset-backed securities transactions involving automotive lease contracts completed on or after January 1, 2006 and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission for which the Company acted as servicer (the Platform ), as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(3)(i)(D), 1122(d)(3)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(ix) through 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), and 1122(d)(4)(vi) through 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. Ford Motor Credit Company LLC s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 

2 of 2 

 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Ford Motor Credit Company LLC complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the asset-backed securities transactions involving automotive lease transactions completed on or after January 1, 2006 and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission for which the Company acted as servicer is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides t rustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
