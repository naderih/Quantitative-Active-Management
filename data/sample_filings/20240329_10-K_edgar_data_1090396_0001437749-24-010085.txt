 COMPETITION 
 
 There is intense competition in the gaming management and gaming products industry which is characterized by dynamic customer demand and rapid technological advances. Today, there are many systems providers in the U.S. and abroad offering casinos and gaming operators total solution casino management and table games management systems. As a result, the Company must continually adapt its approach and its products to meet this demand and match technological advances and, if it cannot do so, the Company s business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted. 
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 
 The gaming and lottery industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation that customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 
 
 While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business 
 
 The Company s business is subject to unpredictable order flows, which might cause its results to fluctuate significantly from period to period . 
 
 Individual system sales can have a long sales cycle, resulting in unpredictable revenue from such sales. Other revenue is derived from expansion opportunities at existing customer facilities and, although existing customers have in the past engaged us to provide expanded services and systems, there is no contractual agreement to provide us with any minimum volume or the ability to expand our services and systems. For these reasons, the Company can experience unpredictable order flows for system expansions. 
 
 Our growth and ability to access capital markets are subject to a number of economic risks. 
 
 Financial markets worldwide can experience disruption, including, among other things, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations. Financial market conditions affect our business in a number of ways. For example, the tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of lease and sale orders for our products and services. In addition, poor financial market conditions could also affect our ability to raise funds in the capital and lending markets. 
 
 Unfavorable economic, social and political conditions, public health crises and other events beyond our control may have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. 
 
 If fewer players visit our customers facilities or, if such players have less disposable income to spend at our customers facilities or if our customers are unable to make timely payments to us or to devote resources to purchasing and leasing our products are/or forced to close their facilities, there could be an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. Such risks that may affect our customers and suppliers and consumers behavior include, but are not limited to: 

adverse economic and market conditions in gaming markets, including recession, inflation, economic slowdown, high rates of unemployment, higher interest rates, higher airfares, higher energy and gasoline prices and rising food and healthcare costs; 

global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility, including the war in Ukraine; 

global health concerns, including pandemics, epidemics, or outbreaks of infectious or contagious diseases such as COVID-19; 

natural disasters such as major fires, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes; and 

inability of our customers to operate due to regulatory disputes, or inability to meet their debt obligations. 

We have agreements with casinos in Native American and foreign jurisdictions, which may subject us to sovereign immunity risks. 
 
 We may have a difficult time enforcing our contracts with Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Native American tribes and the casinos they operate. These customers may enjoy significant immunity or impracticality from suit. For instance, in order to sue a Native American tribe (or an agency or instrumentality of a Native American tribe); the Native American tribe must have effectively waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute. While we always seek the waivers of immunity initially, they may not always become a part of our final contracts with Native American tribes. Without a waiver, limited or otherwise, of the tribe s sovereign immunity, our ordinary rights and remedies (such as our right to enter Native American lands to retrieve our property in the event of a breach of contract by the tribal party to that contract, or our right to enforce any outside judgment against such tribal party) will not likely be enforceable. 
 
 Our business may suffer if our products become obsolete or demand for them decreases, including without limitation, as a result of our inability to develop innovative products or respond to technological changes. 
 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from leasing, licensing, selling and other financing arrangements of products within the gaming industry. Consistent demand for and satisfaction with our products by our customers is critical to our financial condition and future success. Problems, issues, defects or dissatisfaction with our products could cause us to lose customers or revenues from leases with minimal notices. Additionally, our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances in our industry and to adapt and improve our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends. If demand for our products weakens due to lack of market acceptance, technological change, increased competition, regulatory changes, or other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Any disruption in our manufacturing processes, any significant increase in manufacturing costs or any inability to manufacture our products to meet demand could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 
 We create our software and many related products ourselves. Should any of these manufacturing processes be disrupted we may be unable to timely remedy such disruption. In such a case, we may be unable to produce a sufficient quantity of our products to meet the demand of our customers. In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and we may not be able to successfully recover these cost increases with increased pricing to our customers. Either case could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 We operate in a very competitive business environment and if we do not adapt our approach and our products to meet this competitive environment, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
 
 There is intense competition in the gaming management and gaming products industry which is characterized by dynamic customer demand and rapid technological advances. Today, there are many systems providers in the U.S. and abroad offering casinos and gaming operators total solution casino management and table games management systems. As a result, we must continually adapt our approach and our products to meet this demand and match technological advances and if we cannot do so, our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted. Conversely, the development of new competitive products or the enhancement of existing competitive products in any market in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Several of our competitors are larger, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. If we are unable to remain dynamic in the face of changes in the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 We are dependent on the success of our customers and their decisions to upgrade or replace their current casino management systems. 
 
 Our success depends on our customers leasing or buying our products to expand their existing operations, replace existing gaming management products or equip a new casino. Any slowdown in the replacement cycle on the part of our customers may negatively impact our operations. 
 
 The opening of new casinos, expansion of existing casinos and replacement of existing gaming management systems in existing casinos fluctuate with demand, economic conditions, regulatory approvals and the availability of financing and have been negatively affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. While the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have abated, there is still potential for negative effects of future pandemics or contagious disease outbreaks. In addition, the expansion of gaming into new jurisdictions can be a protracted process, usually requiring a public referendum and/or legislative action before establishing or expanding gaming. Any of these factors could delay, restrict or prohibit the expansion of our business and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 If our products contain defects, our reputation could be harmed and our operating results and financial results could be adversely affected. 
 
 Some of our products and our anticipated future products are complex and may contain defects that we do not detect. The occurrence of defects or malfunctions in one or more of our products could result in financial losses for our customers and in turn the termination of leases, cancellation of orders, product returns and diversion of our resources, and could additionally result in lost revenues, civil damages and regulatory penalties, as well as possible rescission of product approvals. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of placements. 
 
 We may not be able to attract, retain, or motivate the management or employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry. 
 
 The competition for qualified personnel in the gaming industry is intense. Our future success depends on the retention and continued contributions of our key management, finance, marketing, development, technical and staff personnel, many of whom would be difficult or impossible to replace. Our success is also tied to our ability to recruit additional key personnel in the future. We may not be able to retain our current personnel or recruit any additional key personnel required. The loss of services of any of our personnel or our inability to recruit additional necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Any disruption in our software and related information technology systems due to a cyber incident could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial conditions. 
 
 We rely on our software and related information technology systems to operate our business. We are also exposed to the risk of cyber incidents in the ordinary course of business, to date, we have not experienced a cyber breach or incident. Cyber incidents may be deliberate attacks for the theft of intellectual property or other sensitive information or may be the result of unintentional actions or events. We have information technology security initiatives and recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate, or implemented properly, or executed timely to ensure that our operations are not disrupted. Cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate, prevent and detect due to their rapidly evolving nature and, as a result, the technology we use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated due to advances in computer capabilities or other technological developments. Potential risks associated with a material cyber incident include loss of intellectual property, impairment of our ability to conduct our operations, disruption of our customers operations, damage to our reputation and our relationships with existing or potential customers, litigation, significant fines, penalties and liability, and increased cyber security protection and remediation costs. Such consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

If we are unable to maintain and implement effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our reported financial information and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We will need to maintain and enhance these processes and controls as we grow, and we may require additional management and staff resources to do so. Additionally, even if we conclude our internal controls are effective for a given period, we may in the future identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls, in which case our management will be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
 
 If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial disclosures, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our reported operating results and harm our reputation. Internal control deficiencies could also result in a restatement of our financial results. 
 
 Risk Factors Relating to Intellectual Property 
 
 We are dependent on our intellectual property and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement, or misappropriation. 
 
 The gaming industry and the software industry are in general characterized by the use of various forms of intellectual property. We are dependent upon patented technologies, trademarked brands and proprietary information for our business. We endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights and our products through a combination of patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. We cannot, however, be certain that any trademark, copyright, issued patent or other types of intellectual property will provide competitive advantages for us. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights or products will be successful. 
 
 Our existing patents may be found invalid or unenforceable and any current or future patent applications may not be approved. 
 
 We have patents and we utilize patent protection in the United States relating to certain processes and products. We cannot assure you that all of our existing patents would be found valid or enforceable or will continue to be valid or enforceable, or that any pending patent applications will be approved. Our competitors may in the future challenge the validity or enforceability of certain of our patents. The patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Competitors may infringe our patents and we may not have adequate resources or there may be other reasons we do not enforce our patents. Our patents may not adequately cover a competitor s products in such a way as to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the future interpretation by courts of United States laws regarding the validity of patents could negatively affect the validity or enforceability of our current or future patents. 
 
 Our efforts to protect our unpatented proprietary technology may not be successful. 
 
 We rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and other collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements are fully enforceable or will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. Furthermore, we may not have adequate resources to enforce these agreements in a meaningful way. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies or enforce the agreements, we use to protect those technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We may not be able to establish or maintain our trademarks. 
 
 We rely on our trademarks, trade names, trade dress, copyrights and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. We have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Our trademarks may not remain valid or enforceable. We may not be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or other intellectual property. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications or challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources towards advertising and marketing new brands. Further, our competitors may infringe our trademarks or other intellectual property and we may not have adequate resources or there may be other reasons we do not enforce our trademarks or other types of intellectual property. 
 
 We may not be able to adequately protect our foreign intellectual property rights. 
 
 Because of the differences in foreign patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property frequently does not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as it would in the United States. Our failure to possess, obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The intellectual property rights of others may limit our ability to make and sell our products. 
 
 The gaming industry is characterized by the rapid development of new technology which requires us to continuously introduce new products using these technologies and innovations, as well as to expand into new markets that may be created. Therefore, our success depends in part on our ability to continually adapt our products and systems to incorporate new technologies and to expand into markets that may be created by new technologies. However, to the extent technologies are protected by the intellectual property rights of others, including our competitors, we may be prevented from introducing products based on these technologies or expanding into markets created by these technologies. If the intellectual property rights of others prevent us from taking advantage of innovative technologies, our financial condition, operating results or prospects may be harmed. 
 
 We have many competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, some of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies. Some competitors have applied for and obtained and may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that may prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our products. Any royalty, licensing or settlement agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
 
 Significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry. 
 
 There is a significant amount of litigation that occurs in the gaming and technology industry. A successful challenge to or invalidation of one of our patents or trademarks, a successful claim of infringement by a third party against us, our products, or one of our licensees in connection with the use of our technology, or an unsuccessful claim of infringement made by us against a third party or its products, could adversely affect our business or cause us financial harm. Any such litigation whether with or without merit could: 

be expensive and time consuming to defend; 

cause one or more of our patents to be ruled or rendered unenforceable or invalid; 

cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; 

require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products; 

divert management s attention and resources; 

require us to pay significant amounts in damages; 

require us to enter into royalty, licensing or settlement agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product, process or component; 

limit our ability to bring new products to the market in the future; or 

cause us, by way of injunction to remove products on lease and/or stop selling or leasing new products. 

Risks Factors Relating to Regulation 
 
 The gaming industry is highly regulated and we must adhere to various regulations and maintain applicable licenses to continue our operations. Failure to abide by regulations or maintain applicable licenses could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our operations. 
 
 We and our products are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we do business and our products are used. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked, suspended or conditioned. In sum, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals. The licensing process may result in delays or adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain key personnel, and our efforts to comply with any new licensing regulations will increase our costs. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain licenses in new jurisdictions where our customers operate. 
 
 We will become subject to regulation in any jurisdiction where our customers operate in the future. To expand into any such jurisdiction, we may need to be licensed, or obtain approvals of our products or services. If we do not receive, or receive a license, or our license is revoked in a particular jurisdiction for our products, we would not be able to sell or place our products in that jurisdiction. Any such outcome could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and any growth plans for our business. 
 
 Legislative and regulatory changes could negatively affect our business and the business of our customers. 
 
 Legislative and regulatory changes may affect demand for or place limitations on the placement of our products. Such changes could affect us in a variety of ways. Legislation or regulation may introduce limitations on our products or opportunities for the use of our products and could foster competitive products or solutions at our or our customers expense. Our business will likely also suffer if our products became obsolete due to changes in laws or the regulatory framework. 
 
 Legislative or regulatory changes negatively impacting the gaming industry as a whole or our customers in particular could also decrease the demand for our products. Opposition to gaming could result in restrictions or even prohibitions of gaming operations in any jurisdiction or could result in increased taxes on gaming revenues. Tax matters, including changes in state, federal or other tax legislation or assessments by tax authorities could have a negative impact on our business. A reduction in growth of the gaming industry or in the number of gaming jurisdictions or delays in the opening of new or expanded casinos could reduce demand for our products. Changes in current or future laws or regulations or future judicial intervention in any particular jurisdiction may have a material adverse effect on our existing and proposed foreign and domestic operations. Any such adverse change in the legislative or regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Risk Factors Related to Our Common Stock 
 
 The limited liquidity for our common stock could affect your ability to sell your shares at a satisfactory price. 
 
 Trading of our common stock is conducted on the over-the-counter markets specifically on the OTCQX, the top-tier quotation marketplace administered by OTC Markets. Our common stock is relatively illiquid. A more active public market for our common stock may not develop, which could adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. Moreover, a thin trading market for our stock could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. This may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock. 
 
 The payment and amount of future dividends is subject to Board of Director discretion and to various risks and uncertainties. 
 
 The payment and amount of future quarterly dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on factors the Board deems relevant at each time it considers declaring a dividend. These factors include, but are not limited to: available cash; management s expectations regarding future performance and free cash flow; alternative uses of cash to fund capital expenditures; and the effect of various risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors section. 
 
 There is currently little trading volume in our common stock, which may make it difficult to sell shares of our common stock. 
 
 In general, there has been very little trading activity in our common stock. The relatively low trading volume will likely make it difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares as and when they choose. Furthermore, low trading volumes generally depress market prices. As a result, you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at or near their original purchase price or at any price.

 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Some of the statements made in this report are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined under Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements describe future expectations, plans, results or strategies and can often be identified by the use of terminology such as may, will, believe, anticipate, intend, estimate, expect and similar expressions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 The Company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventory valuation, intangible assets, and income taxes. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and judgments that the Company believes have the most effect on its reported financial position and results of operations are as follows: 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company derives revenues from the sales of systems, licenses and maintenance fees, hardware leasing and services. 
 
 System Sales 
 
 Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected, when applicable from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 
 
 A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is a unit of account in ASC 606. A majority of the Company s systems sales have multiple performance obligations including an obligation to deliver a casino management system and another to provide maintenance services. For system sales with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its Standalone Selling Price ("SSP"). See discussion within the significant judgement paragraph regarding our determination of SSP. At contract inception, management assesses whether it is probable that the company will collect substantially all of the consideration to determine whether the contract meets the criterion for collectability. The revenue allocated to the casino management system is recognized upon installation. The Company occasionally enters into contracts that include multiple sites; management has determined that each site installation is a separate performance obligation. In these instances, the Company recognizes revenue upon completion of each performance obligation. In addition, the Company has a contract with a reseller who purchases and resells the Company s products; monthly the reseller notifies the Company of their successful installations and submits an invoice to the Company for those installations. The Company also analyzes its standard business practice of using long-term contracts and the history of collecting on extended payment term contracts which include a significant financing component which is usually a market interest rate. The associated interest income is reflected accordingly on the statement of operations. 
 
 Management s assessment of collectability at both contract inception and on an ongoing basis resulted in the determination that some of our contracts did not meet the criterion for collectability. The balance of these contracts are not included as part of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Accordingly, for these contracts whereby the collectability criterion has not been met, revenue will be recognized as payments are received. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has accessed that approximately 2,392,560 and 2,781,800 for these systems did not meet the revenue recognition collectability criterion. Management considered the following facts and circumstances in its determination: these installations are subject to different regulators than our current customer base; Payments have not been received for items invoiced; one customer has a large debtor in a senior position to Table Trac. Both contracts will continue to be recognized on a cash basis subject to ongoing collectability assessment. A change in the collectability assessment in a future period may allow the Company to recognize revenue prior to collecting cash. 
 
 Maintenance Revenue 
 
 Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. The SSP for maintenance is based upon the renewal rate for contracted services. 
 
 Lease Revenue 
 
 The Company derives a portion of its revenue from a sales type leasing arrangement in accordance with ASC 842 . The Company leases hardware to a customer, and receives monthly payments. 
 
 Service Revenue and Other Revenue 
 
 Service revenue is recognized upon completion of the services and are billed in arrears. The SSP for service revenue is established based upon actual selling prices for the services or prior similar arrangements. 
 
 Other revenue includes DataTrac, kiosks and related promotional programs and miscellaneous sales of equipment. Revenue is recognized upon completion of services or delivery of equipment and is billed in arrears. 
 
 The Company offers qualified customers a licensing agreement. Licensing revenue is recognized after the intellectual property (CMS system), the performance obligation, is delivered and in its operational and functional state. The stand-alone selling price for licensing revenue is established based upon actual selling prices for the license. 
 
 See also Note 1. 
 
 Accounts Receivable / Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Accounts receivable are initially recorded at the invoiced amount and carried on the balance sheet at net realizable value as of each balance sheet date. The company offers customers extended payment terms for periods of 6 to 72 months and as amounts under these long-term accounts receivable become due within one year, they are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable. For receivables related to contracts that contain an interest rate, interest is recorded upon receipt to interest income on the statements of operations. An allowance for credit losses is recorded when the Company believes the amounts may not be collected. Management believes that receivables, net of the allowance for credit losses, are fully collectible. Accounts receivable are written off when management determines collection is no longer likely. While the ultimate result may differ, management believes that any write-off not allowed for will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position. 
 
 Inventory 
 
 Inventory, consisting of finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The average cost method is used to value inventory. Inventory is reviewed annually for the lower of cost or net realizable value and obsolescence. Any material cost found to be above market value or considered obsolete is written down accordingly. The Compa ny had 8,768 and 2,273 of obsolescence reserves at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method of accounting. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Table Trac, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Table Trac, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Revenue Recognition 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 
 As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. The Company enters into contracts with its customers that may contain multiple performance obligations including hardware, software, lease, installation services, training, and maintenance. Significant judgment may be required by the Company in determining revenue recognition specific to these contracts with multiple performance obligations, and includes the following: 
 
 Assessing collectability of contracts with customers. 
 
 Determination of whether hardware, software, lease, installation services, training, and maintenance are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting. 
 
 Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation, particularly for performance obligations not sold separately. 

Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to revenue recognition included the following, among others: 
 
 We evaluated the Company s accounting policies and related disclosures for compliance with applicable revenue recognition accounting guidance. 
 
 We obtained an understanding of the design and implementation of internal controls related to the Company s revenue recognition process, including the assessment of collectability, identification of performance obligations and allocation of transaction price. 
 
 We selected a sample of transactions and performed the following procedures: 
 
 o Tested the existence and accuracy of the transaction by obtaining and agreeing terms to the underlying source documents. 
 
 o Evaluated management s identification of distinct performance obligations and management s determination of the standalone selling prices. 
 
 o We tested management s assessment of collectability by obtaining an understanding of the facts and circumstances considered, and judgments applied. 
 o We tested significant cash receipts to verify the corresponding revenue. 
 
 o Evaluated whether the transaction was accounted for in accordance with the Company s revenue and related costs policies.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2015.

A major customer is defined as any customer that represents at least 10 of revenue or outstanding account receivable for a given period.

System, sales-type lease, and certain other revenue is recorded at a point in time. Maintenance and service revenue is recorded over time. 
 
 Significant Judgments 
 
 Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. 
 
 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation, including lease and non-lease components. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when we sell a product or service separately. 
 
 In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we perform a gross margin analysis using information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. 
 
 We recognize a contract asset when our performance under a contract precedes our receipt of consideration from a customer, or before payment is due, and our receipt of consideration is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. A contract asset is recognized when we have an unconditional right to payment for our perf ormance. Our contract asset consists of our in-process installations, for which we have an enforceable right to collect consideration (including a reasonable profit) in the event the services are cancelled by customers. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , we recorded a contract asset of approximately and respectively as a component of accounts receivable. 
 
 As of January 1, 2022, the balance of accounts receivable, net and customer deposits were and , respectively. 
 
 The collectability assessment requires the company to use judgement and consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Management exercises judgment in its assessment of collectability of customer funds by considering payment history, current credit status, and available information about the financial condition of the customer, among other factors. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , approximatel y and for systems installed under contract have not been recorded as revenue or included in accounts receivable based on the collectability assessment performed by the Company. In accordance with this assessment, the contracts will be assessed in subsequent quarters at which time they may be deemed collectable and the outstanding remaining system revenue will be recognized accordingly. 
 
 The collectability assessment requires the company to use judgement and consider all relevant facts and circumstances. 
 
 We evaluate the interest rates in customer contracts with extended payment terms, representing a significant financing component. These rates range from approximately to a nd we believe those to be appropriate market interest rates for the financing component.

 Item 9A. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 
 (a) DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to the material weaknesses assessed during 2022 of our internal control over financial reporting and that 2023 did not present enough instances to properly test our remediation plan, as further described below. Notwithstanding, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer believe the consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and including this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 (b) REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company has designed internal controls to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company assesses the effectiveness of internal controls based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 As a result of this evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below and because management does not believe it has adequately retested its internal controls as of such date. 
 
 (c) REMEDIATION PLAN 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the company identified a material weakness in its design of controls over accounting and reporting of significant, non-recurring events, and complex transactions. This material weakness could result in a misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
 
 During 2023, the Company designed and implemented a remediation plan for the identified material weakness, which includes engaging accounting experts to assist with the accounting for significant, non-recurring events and complex transactions, when needed. While management believes the designed and implemented remediation plan will be sufficient to remediate the risk of a misstatement related to accounting for significant, non-recuing events and complex transactions, the material weakness cannot be considered to be remedied in 2023 as there were not enough significant, non-recurring or complex transactions to test the effectiveness of the remediation plan. 
 
 The remediation actions are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight. The Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps taken will fully remediate the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting until remediation efforts are completed, tested, and evaluated for effectiveness. 
 
 (d) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Except for the matters discussed above, there were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
