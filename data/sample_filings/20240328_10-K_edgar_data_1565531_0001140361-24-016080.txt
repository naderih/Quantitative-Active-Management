The following information is substitute information provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K:

Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB. Significant Obligor Financial Information

No single obligor represents more than 10 of the pool assets held by the Issuing Entity.

Items 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives

Items 1115(b) of Regulation AB. Credit Derivatives Instruments

No entity or group of affiliated entities provides derivative instruments with respect to payments on the notes issued by the Issuing Entity.

Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings

Other than as stated in the following paragraphs, no legal proceedings are pending against the Issuing Entity, Navient Solutions, LLC (formerly, Navient Solutions, Inc.) Navient
 Solutions ), as the Sponsor, the Servicer and the Administrator, Navient Funding, LLC, as the Depositor (the Depositor and registrant under Registration Statement Number 333-190926 (the Registrant or to the Registrant s knowledge, Deutsche
 Bank National Trust Company, as the Indenture Trustee that are or would be material to the holders of the notes issued by the Issuing Entity, nor does the Registrant know of any such proceeding contemplated by any governmental authorities.

The following four paragraphs are disclosure received from Navient Solutions, the servicer for this transaction.

Navient Corporation Navient has been named as defendant in a number of putative class action and other cases alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection
 laws including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), in adversarial proceedings under the United States
 Bankruptcy Code, and various state consumer protection laws. At this point in time, Navient is unable to anticipate the timing of a resolution or the impact that these legal proceedings may have on its consolidated financial position, liquidity,
 results of operation or cash flows. As a result, it is not possible at this time to estimate a range of potential exposure, if any, for amounts that may be payable in connection with these matters and loss contingency accruals have not been
 established. It is possible that an adverse ruling or rulings may have a material adverse impact on Navient, Navient Solutions and/or their affiliates or on the financial ability of the depositor, the servicer or a seller to fulfill an obligation
 to purchase or repurchase trust student loans in connection with a breach of representation, warranty or covenant.

2 

In January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) and Attorneys General for the State of Illinois and the State of Washington initiated civil actions naming
 Navient and several of its subsidiaries (including Navient Solutions) as defendants alleging violations of certain Federal and State consumer protection statutes, including the CFPA, FCRA, FDCPA and various state consumer protection laws. The
 Attorneys General for the States of Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, and New Jersey also initiated actions against Navient and certain subsidiaries alleging violations of various state and federal consumer protection laws based upon similar
 alleged acts or failures to act. In addition to these matters, a number of lawsuits have been filed by nongovernmental parties or, in the future, may be filed by additional governmental or nongovernmental parties seeking damages or other remedies
 related to similar issues raised by the CFPB and the State Attorneys General. In January 2022, Navient entered into a series of Consent Judgment and Orders (the Agreements with 40 State Attorneys General to resolve all matters in dispute related
 to the State Attorneys General cases as well as the related investigations, subpoenas, civil investigative demands and inquiries from various other state regulators. These Agreements do not resolve the litigation involving Navient and the CFPB.
 Navient has cancelled the loan balance of approximately 66,000 borrowers with qualifying Private Education Loans that were originated largely between 2002 and 2010 and later defaulted and charged off. The loans cancelled have aggregate outstanding
 balances of approximately 1.7 billion. The expense to Navient to cancel these loans was approximately 50 million which represents the amount of expected future recoveries of these charged-off loans on the balance sheet. In addition, Navient
 agreed to make a one-time payment of approximately 145 million to the states. In the fourth quarter of 2021 when such loss became probable, Navient recognized total regulatory expenses of approximately 205 million related to this matter.

As Navient has previously stated, Navient believes the allegations in the CFPB suit are false and that they improperly seek to impose penalties on Navient based on new, previously
 unannounced servicing standards applied retroactively against only one servicer. Navient therefore has denied these allegations and is vigorously defending against the allegations in that case. Due to recent developments in connection with the CFPB
 case, Navient increased its accrual for probable incurred loss in this matter to 72.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The litigation process is not predictable and can lead to unexpected results and therefore it is reasonably possible that
 Navient s exposure to loss may exceed any amounts accrued.

On April 12, 2023, Navient reached an agreement in principle Settlement with certain plaintiffs for a nationwide settlement of claims raised in the following bankruptcy
 adversary actions: Coyle v. Navient Solutions, LLC, No. 22-80018 (Bankr. W.D. Mich.); Homaidan v. SLM Corp., No. 1:17-ap-01085 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y.); Mazloom v. Navient Solutions, LLC, No. 20-80033-6 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y.); and Woodard v. Navient Solutions,
 LLC, No. 08-81442 (Bankr. D. Neb.) collectively referred to as the Bankruptcy Cases. The Settlement has received final court approval. Under the Settlement, Navient will forego the collection of defined balances for borrowers or co-borrowers of
 certain private loans all of which were originated prior to Navient s separation who have received a discharge in bankruptcy during the periods covered by the agreements. As a result, Navient recorded a 23 million additional private loan
 provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2023 related to the estimated future charge offs that are expected to occur. Navient has also agreed to fund settlement funds. Navient anticipates that any cash contribution it will be required to
 make to these funds will not exceed 44 million in the aggregate and will be fully covered by insurance. The net impact to operating expense for this element of the settlement for the first quarter of 2023 was 0 due to the accrual of the
 offsetting insurance reimbursements.

The following three paragraphs are disclosure received from Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company DBNTC and
 Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts.

On December 23, 2014, certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited that held RMBS certificates issued by 21 RMBS trusts filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
 Southern District of New York against DBNTC as trustee of the trusts, asserting claims for violation of the TIA and the Streit Act, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, gross negligence, and negligent misrepresentation, based
 on DBNTC s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the trusts. On April 10, 2015, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint relating to an additional 34 trusts (for a total of 55 trusts) and amended their complaint for a second time on
 July 15, 2015 to include additional allegations and to drop their claim for negligent misrepresentation. In that complaint, plaintiffs alleged damages of over U.S. 527 million. On February 2, 2016, the court entered a stipulation signed by the
 parties to dismiss with prejudice claims relating to four of the 55 trusts, leaving 51 trusts at issue. DBNTC filed a motion to dismiss. On March 29, 2016, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC s motion to dismiss. The court allowed
 the majority of plaintiffs breach of contract claims to proceed. The court denied DBNTC s motion to dismiss breach of fiduciary duty claims. The court granted the motion to dismiss to the extent that negligence claims were duplicative of breach
 of contract claims but denied the motion to dismiss to the extent plaintiffs alleged DBNTC violated extra-contractual duties. In addition, the court dismissed breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims. The court also
 denied the motion to dismiss claims for alleged violations of Sections 315(b) and 315(c) of the TIA, but dismissed claims under 316(b). Finally, the court dismissed plaintiffs Streit Act claim. Following the court s decision on the motion to
 dismiss, 46 trusts remained at issue. On May 13, 2016, DBNTC filed an answer to the amended complaint. On December 20, 2016, the court ordered the parties stipulation dismissing plaintiffs claims relating to three trusts, leaving 43 trusts at
 issue. On September 27, 2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. 
 Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings claims for violation of the TIA; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence and gross negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third
 amended complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge that the court previously dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of
 plaintiffs breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third
 amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary
 judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary
 judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed with prejudice. On April 26, 2023,
 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the court s summary judgment order.

On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in the Supreme
 Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of
 interest, violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5,
 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as to seven trusts. On January 27,
 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial
 Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of
 fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department, regarding certain
 aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department affirmed
 in part and reversed in part the court s order on the motion to dismiss. After DBNTC and DBTCA appealed the First Department s decision, on June 15, 2023, the New York Court of Appeals reversed the First Department s decision in part, dismissing
 certain additional contract claims, as well as IKB s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the
 motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven
 additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all
 claims as to 17 certificates at issue, including all claims as to 5 trusts. On February 28, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to two trusts, leaving 15 trusts at issue. On November 21,
 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to three trusts, leaving 12 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing.

It is DBTCA s and DBNTC s belief that they have no pending legal proceedings, including, based on DBTCA s and DBNTC s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the immediately
 preceding two paragraphs that would materially affect their ability to perform their duties under the Indenture for this transaction.

 that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows:

Platform : Publicly-issued i.e. , transaction-level reporting required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e. , for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities

 the Platform as to any transaction, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (the Applicable
 Servicing Criteria ). With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to the Platform,

 1122(d)(1)(iii) as of and for the Period. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the activities the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information
 received from servicers and the accurate conveyance of such information within reports to investors. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with
 respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements.

With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company s management provides the following assertion of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:

The Company s management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

 Navient Corporation:

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria , that Navient Solutions, LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for its
 servicing of student loan asset-backed securities transactions that were outstanding during the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 (the Platform and each such asset-backed securities transaction is a Platform Trust) to the extent
 required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(x) 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has
 concluded were not required by the Company under the related transaction agreements for any Platform Trust (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(2)(iv),
 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vii), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), the Company has concluded that such criteria are not applicable under the related transaction agreements for the SMB Private
 Education Loan Trust 2014-A transaction and Goal Structured Solutions Trust 2016-B transaction. Appendix B to Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB
 Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform for which the Company acted as administrator or sub-administrator, as applicable collectively, the
 Administrator) and servicer or sub-servicer, as applicable (collectively, the Servicer) during the period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our
 responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with
 attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria
 and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to
 the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
 servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or
 amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not
 provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the Servicing Criteria.

We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination
 engagement.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is
 fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion of Compliance, that Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank
 Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting required under
 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed
 securities and other asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator, securities administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction
 agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has
 determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform.
 Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
 accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included
 testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those
 selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period
 covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the
 period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation
 AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
 a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement.

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the platform is fairly stated, in all material
 respects.
