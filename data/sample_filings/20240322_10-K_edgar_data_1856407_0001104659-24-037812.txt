MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT REPORT 

Management of Wilmington Trust National Association
(the Company) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv),
1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to the servicing of auto related asset-backed transactions initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after January
1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee services (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management has
determined that all other criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by the Company with
respect to the Platform. Appendix A to this report identifies the auto related asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting
the Platform. 

The Company s management has assessed the
Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in criterion (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(3)(i),
(d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(3)(iv) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The activities the Company performs with respect to the applicable
1122(d) servicing criteria are listed on the attached Appendix A. 

With respect to the Company s obligation
to issue a notification to be included in the client s Form 8-K. Form 10-D and Form 10-K under applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i),
there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2023, with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences
of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 

Based on such assessment, management believes
that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation
AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a registered public
accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To Management and the Board of Directors of World
Omni Financial Corp. 

We have examined management s assertion,
included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that World Omni Financial Corp. (the
 Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation
AB for all asset-backed securities transactions of automobile and light duty truck retail installment sale contracts sponsored by World
Omni Financial Corp. since January 1, 2006 and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission (the Platform ), as of
December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(ix),
1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable
to the activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria.
The Company has determined that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and
the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted
by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted
under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors' activities
comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion,
and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. World Omni
Financial Corp. s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated,
in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included
testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related
to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed
by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors
that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

We are required to be independent and to meet
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that
World Omni Financial Corp. complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023
for all asset-backed securities transactions of automobile and light duty truck retail installment sale contracts sponsored by World Omni
Financial Corp. since January 1, 2006 and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission is fairly stated, in all material respects.
