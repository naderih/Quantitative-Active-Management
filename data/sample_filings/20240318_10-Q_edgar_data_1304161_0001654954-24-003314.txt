The Transition Tax liability must be paid over a period of eight years which started with the Company s second quarter of fiscal year 2019.

In addition, IDI earnings distributions accumulated since November 1, 2009 are exempt from Puerto Rico earnings distribution tax. Under provisions of Puerto Rico Acts 60-2019 and 73-2008, the Company has requested PRIDCO the renegotiation of the Grant for an additional term of fifteen years. Puerto Rico operations not covered in the exempt activities of the Grant are subject to Puerto Rico income tax at a maximum tax rate of as provided by the 1994 Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, as amended.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

In addition, reference should be made to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, and related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward-looking statements, see Forward Looking Statements below and the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview We are a compliance and technology transfer services consulting firm with headquarters in Puerto Rico, servicing the Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and the Brazil markets. The compliance consulting service sector in those markets consists of local compliance and validation consulting firms, United States dedicated validation and compliance consulting firms and large publicly traded and private domestic and foreign engineering and consulting firms. We provide a broad range of compliance related consulting services. We market our services to pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology, medical devices, cosmetics and food industries, and allied products companies in Puerto Rico, the United States, Europe and Brazil. Our consulting team includes experienced engineering and life science professionals, former quality assurance managers and directors, and professionals with bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees in health sciences and engineering. We actively operate in a number of markets. We intend to further penetrate these markets by strengthening our business development infrastructure and by constantly realigning our business strategies as new opportunities and challenges arise. Furthermore, for fiscal year 2024, we plan to continue to invest in additional business development resources to take advantage of significant opportunities in underserved markets. We believe these investments will further develop our business strategy, minimize occasional revenue fluctuations, and deliver on our commitment of delivering premium quality and professional consulting services in the markets that need our knowledge, expertise, and skills. We market our services with an active presence in industry trade shows, professional conventions, industry publications and company provided seminars to the industry. Our senior management is also actively involved in the marketing process, especially in marketing to major accounts. Our senior management and staff also concentrate on developing new business opportunities and focus on the larger customer accounts (by number of consultants or dollar volume) and responding to prospective customers requests for proposals. We consider our core business to be Food and Drug Administration FDA and international agencies regulatory compliance consulting related services. The Company holds a tax grant issued by PRIDCO, which provides relief on various Puerto Rico taxes, including income tax, with certain limitations, for most of the activities carried on within Puerto Rico, including those that are for services to parties located outside of Puerto Rico. The grant was effective as of November 1, 2009 and covers a fifteen-year period, ending on October 31, 2024. Under provisions of Puerto Rico Acts 60-2019 and 73-2008, we have requested PRIDCO renegotiation of the tax grant for an additional term of fifteen years. As of the date of this filing, we have not received a status from PRIDCO for this request, accordingly, we cannot provide assurance on the outcome for our renegotiation application. For additional information relating to the tax grant issued by PRIDCO, please see Note C Income Taxes of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The following table sets forth information as to our revenue for the three-month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, by geographic regions (dollars in thousands). Three months ended January 31, Revenues by Region: 2024 2023 Puerto Rico 1,390 58.4 2,174 51.3 United States 883 37.1 1,094 25.8 Europe 65 2.7 970 22.9 Other 42 1.8 - 0.0 2,380 100.0 4,238 100.0 -14- Table of Contents For the three-month period ended January 31, 2024, the Company s total revenues were approximately 2.4 million, a net decrease of approximately 1.9 million when compared to the same period last year. The Puerto Rico, U.S. and European consulting markets had a decline in projects revenue of approximately 0.8, 0.2 and 0.9 million, respectively. As depicted below, when compared to the same period last year, gross profit decreased by 6.8 percentage points. The net decline in gross profit percentage points is mainly attributable to the closure in fiscal year 2023 of high margin yielding projects within the European market. Regional or global conflicts, including war or economic sanctions between nations, price inflation, pandemics, the Tax Reform, possible tax changes on jurisdictions where we do business, bio-pharmaceutical industry consolidations and the trends on managing contract resources, all pose current and future challenges which may adversely affect our future performance. We believe that our future profitability and liquidity will be dependent on the effect the local and global economy, including any impacts of regional or global conflicts, price inflation, pandemics, changes in tax laws, worldwide life science manufacturing industry consolidations, operational constraints imposed by our customers due to pandemics and resources management trends, will have on our operations, and our ability to seek service opportunities and adapt to industry trends. Results of Operations The following table that sets forth our statements of operations for the three-month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands, and as a percentage of revenues): Three months ended January 31, 2024 2023 Revenues 2,380 100.0 4,238 100.0 Cost of services 1,845 77.5 2,998 70.7 Gross profit 535 22.5 1,240 29.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 974 40.9 911 21.5 Other income, net 181 7.6 246 5.8 Income (loss) before income taxes (258 -10.8 575 13.6 Income tax expense 13 0.5 149 3.5 Net income (loss) (271 -11.3 426 10.1 Revenues . For the three-month period ended January 31, 2024, the Company s total revenues were approximately 2.4 million, a net decrease of approximately 1.9 million when compared to the same period last year. The Puerto Rico, US and European consulting markets had a decline in projects revenue of approximately 0.8, 0.2 and 0.9 million, respectively. Cost of Services; Gross Profit . For the three-month period ended January 31, 2024, cost of services was approximately 1.8 million, a decrease of approximately 1.2 million, when compared to the same period last year. Gross profit decreased by 6.8 percentage points during the period. The net decline in gross profit percentage points is mainly attributable to the closure in fiscal year 2023 of high margin yielding projects within the European market. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . For the three-month period ended January 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 1.0 million, an increase of approximately 0.1 million when compared to the same period last year. The increase is mostly attributable to investments in business development human capital and industry activities aimed to achieve growth in targeted markets. Other Income, Net . Other income, net for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was approximately 0.2 million, not a significant change when compared to the same period last year. Net Income (Loss) . Net loss for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was approximately 0.3 million, an earnings decline of approximately 0.7 million when compared to the same period last year.

As of January 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 15.1 million in working capital. On June 13, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to repurchase up to two million shares of its common stock (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. During the three-month period ended January 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 7,100 shares of its common stock. As of January 31, 2024, the Company has 1,506,443 shares of common stock available for future repurchases under the Repurchase Program. Our primary cash needs consist of the payment of compensation to our consulting team, overhead expenses, and statutory taxes. Additionally, we may use cash for the repurchase of our common stock under the Repurchase Program, capital expenditures and business development expenses. Management believes that based on the current level of working capital, operations and cash flows from operations, and the collectability of high-quality customer receivables are sufficient to fund anticipated expenses and satisfy other possible long-term contractual commitments. To the extent that we pursue possible opportunities to expand our operations, either by acquisition or by the establishment of operations in a new market, we will incur additional overhead, and there may be a delay between the period we commence operations and our generation of net cash flow from operations. While uncertainties relating to the current local and global economic conditions, competition, the industries and geographical regions served by us and other regulatory matters exist within the consulting services industry, as described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management is not aware of any other trends or events likely to have a material adverse effect on liquidity or its financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We were not involved in any significant off-balance sheet arrangement during the three months ended January 31, 2024. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There were no material changes during the three months ended January 31, 2024 to the critical accounting policies reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. New Accounting Pronouncements There were no new accounting standards issued since our filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023, which could have a significant effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, and the prevailing market price and performance of our common stock, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
