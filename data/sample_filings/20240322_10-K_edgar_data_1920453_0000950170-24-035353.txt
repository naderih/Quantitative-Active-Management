CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are current expectations, estimates, and projections of Fidelity Private Credit Fund (the Fund, we, us or our and/or Fidelity Diversifying Solutions LLC FDS or the Adviser about the Fund, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, seek, expect, anticipate, project, estimate, intend, continue, target, or believe or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or the actual performance of the Fund may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report and in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. 
 The following factors are among those that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements: 
 our future operating results; 

our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; 

our ability to raise capital; 

geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Israel; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Adviser and its affiliates; 

the elevating levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser to identify suitable investments and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser and its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company RIC and as a business development company BDC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; 

the impact on our business of U.S. and international financial reform legislation, rules and regulations; 

1 

the effect of changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations thereof; and 

the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 

You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future file with the SEC including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. This Annual Report contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report because we are an investment company. 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 The following is only a summary of the principal risks that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The following should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the risk factors we face, which are set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report. 
 Risks Relating to an Investment in the Fund 
 We are a relatively new company with limited operating history and the Adviser and the portfolio managers have limited prior experience managing a BDC. 

An investment in the Fund is suitable only for certain sophisticated investors that have no need for immediate liquidity in respect of their investment and who can accept the risks associated with investing in illiquid investments. 

The Fund is managed exclusively by the Adviser and Fund investors should expect to rely solely on the ability of the Adviser with respect to the Fund s operations. 

The Fund may seek to obtain indebtedness on an investment-by-investment basis, and leverage may not be available or may be available on less desirable terms in connection with particular investments. 

The greater the total leverage of the Fund relative to its assets, the greater the risk of loss and possibility of gain due to changes in the values of its investments. 

Fair value pricing is based on subjective judgments, and it is possible that fair value of a security may differ materially from the value that would be realized if the security were sold. 

When conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding a potential investment, the due diligence process may at times rely on limited or incomplete information. 

To prevent portfolio managers of the Fund from receiving material, non-public information that may prevent them from being able to trade in investments in other accounts the portfolio managers manage, portfolio management personnel may be subject to information barriers and prevented from accessing certain information regarding Fund investments to which investors are otherwise entitled. 

The Fund may be exposed to losses resulting from default and foreclosure of any such loans or interests in loans in which it has invested. 

The Fund s Board of Trustees has the authority to modify or waive certain of the Fund s operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without investor approval, the effects of which may be adverse to the Fund s business and impact its ability to make distributions. 

The Fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve investment results that will allow it to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. 

Widespread disease, pandemics and epidemics, and natural or environmental disasters have been and can be highly disruptive to economies and markets and may have a materially adverse impact on the Fund s financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks Relating to the Fund s Investments 
 We generally will not control our portfolio companies and our investments in prospective portfolio companies may be risky. 

2 

Portfolio companies may be highly leveraged, and there is no restriction on the amount of debt a portfolio company can incur. 

Of paramount concern in originating loans is the possibility of material misrepresentation or omission on the part of borrowers or guarantors. 

We will be exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. 

Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and adversely affect our operating results. 

Risks Relating to Certain Regulatory and Tax Matters 
 If the Fund does not maintain its status as a BDC, the Fund would be subject to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended which would significantly decrease its operating flexibility. 

Any new or changed U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Fund s business. 

The inability of the Fund or the Adviser to obtain necessary licenses or authorizations, the structuring of an investment in an inefficient or otherwise disadvantageous manger, or changes in licensing requirements, could adversely affect the Fund s ability to implement its investment program and achieve its intended results. 

Any significant changes in governmental policies could have a material adverse impact on the Fund and its investments. 

Under certain circumstances it would be possible for the Fund to obtain a controlling interest in certain portfolio companies, thus, the Fund could be treated as a single employer with one or more of its portfolio companies for purposes of controlled group rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 

If we do not qualify for or maintain RIC tax treatment and are subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. 

The Fund expects to invest in debt securities that are rated below investment grade or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated, which may present special tax issues. 

Website Disclosure 
 We use our website (fidcredit.com) as a channel of distribution of Fund information. The information we post through this channel may be deemed material. Accordingly, investors should monitor this channel, in addition to following our press releases and SEC filings. The contents of our website are not, however, a part of this Annual Report.

PART I 
 Item 1. B usiness. 
 Our Company 
 Fidelity Private Credit Fund (the Fund, we, us or our is a Delaware statutory trust that was formed on March 23, 2022. The Fund operates as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). The Fund is externally managed by Fidelity Diversifying Solutions LLC FDS or the Adviser ), which is registered as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and an affiliate of FMR LLC FMR and its subsidiaries. The Fund intends to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company RIC as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 
 The Fund s investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Fund will achieve these objectives primarily through directly originated loans to private companies but also with liquid credit investments, like broadly syndicated loans, and other select Private Credit (as defined below) investments. The Fund will generally seek to invest in loans that carry variable i.e. , floating interest rates. The majority of the Fund s investments will be loans targeted at private U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250,000,000 Portfolio Investments ). The Fund may also invest to a lesser degree in non-U.S. companies. Specific investments may include: (a) directly originated first lien loans, senior secured revolving lines of credit, term loans and delayed draw term loans, (b) directly originated second lien, last out senior, secured or unsecured mezzanine term loans and delayed draw term loans, (c) club deals (investments generally comprised of a small group of lenders), and broadly syndicated leveraged loans (investments generally arranged or underwritten by investment banks or other intermediaries), and (d) other debt (collectively referred to as Private Credit ). The Fund may also invest to a lesser degree in equity linked instruments (may include debt with warrants, preferred equity investments, or equity co-investments). The Adviser and/or its affiliates may lead and structure the transaction as sole-lender, as the agent of a club credit facility (a group of similar direct lenders that invest in the same tranches), or may participate as a non-agent investor in a large club or syndicated transactions. 
 Most of the debt instruments the Fund invests in will be unrated or rated below investment grade, which is often an indication of size, credit worthiness and speculative nature relative to the capacity of the borrower to pay interest and principal. Generally, if the Fund unrated investments were rated, they would be rated below investment grade. 
 Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80 of its total assets in Private Credit. The Fund will also invest at least 70 of its total assets in investments that meet regulatory requirements of the BDC structure, which will generally include investments in companies that are generally private and may be backed by private equity sponsors (each, a Sponsor and collectively, Sponsors but may also include investments in small capitalization public companies or companies that are backed by a non-private equity sponsor ownership group. 
 The Fund will borrow money for investment and cash management purposes. In determining whether to borrow money, the Fund will analyze the financial flexibility, maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to the Fund s investment outlook. 
 The Fund is offering on a continuous basis up to 1,000,000,000 of our common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Shares (the Offering ). The Fund expects to offer to sell any combination of three classes of Common Shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees. The purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals our net asset value NAV per share, as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase date. Fidelity Distributors Company LLC, the managing dealer (the Managing Dealer for this Offering, will use its best efforts to sell shares, but is not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of shares in this Offering. 
 The Fund has no fixed term, and it will remain in existence until dissolved in accordance with the Declaration of Trust or pursuant to Delaware law. The Fund intends to operate as a non-exchange traded, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose Common Shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. The Fund uses the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration whose Common Shares are intended to be sold by the Fund on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to the Fund s NAV per Share. 
 4 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund may, at any time, determine to pursue a sale of all or substantially all of the Fund s assets to, a purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of, or other liquidity event with, another entity or a transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or sale of Common Shares in each case for consideration of either cash and/or publicly listed securities of the acquirer, in each case subject to any required approvals and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Potential acquirers could include other BDCs and entities that are not BDCs, in each case, that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliates or by unaffiliated third-parties. The Fund is not a subsidiary of or consolidated with the Fidelity organization Fidelity Investments or Fidelity ). 
 On September 16, 2022, an affiliate of the Adviser purchased 80 shares of the Fund s Class I Common Shares at 25.00 per share. On March 13, 2023, an affiliate of the Adviser purchased 1,280,002 shares of the Fund s Class I Common Shares at 25.00 per share. 
 As of March 13, 2023, the Fund satisfied the minimum offering requirement, and the Fund s Board of Trustees (the "Board") authorized the release of proceeds from escrow. On March 13, 2023, the Fund issued and sold 4,084,292 shares (consisting of 4,084,292 Class I shares; no Class S or D shares were issued or sold as of such date), and the escrow agent released net proceeds of approximately 102 million to the Fund as payment for such shares. 
 On November 1, 2023, an affiliate of the Adviser purchased 391 shares, respectively of the Fund s Class S and Class D Common Shares at 25.54 per share. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Fund had 15,723,605, 395, and 395, respectively, of Class I, Class S, and Class D Common Shares outstanding. 
 The Adviser and the Administrator 
 The Fund s investment activities are managed by the Adviser. The Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, determining the value of Fund investments, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 
 FDS, in its capacity as our Administrator (the Administrator ), provides, or oversees the performance of, administrative and compliance services. 
 FDS is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR. FDS is also registered with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended, as a commodity pool operator and a commodity trading advisor, and is a member of the National Futures Association. FDS leverages the resources of the entire Fidelity organization in managing the Fund. 
 FMR, as successor by merger to FMR Corp., is the ultimate parent company of FDS. The voting common shares of FMR are divided into two series. Series B is held predominantly by members of the Johnson family, including Abigail P. Johnson, directly or through trusts, and is entitled to 49 of the vote on any matter acted upon by the voting common shares. Series A is held predominantly by non-Johnson family member employees of FMR and its affiliates and is entitled to 51 of the vote on any such matter. The Johnson family group and all other Series B shareholders have entered into a shareholders voting agreement under which all Series B shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of Series B shares. Under the 1940 Act, control of a company is presumed where one individual or group of individuals owns more than 25 of the voting securities of that company. Therefore, through their ownership of voting common shares and the execution of the shareholders voting agreement, members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the 1940 Act, to form a controlling group with respect to FMR. 
 At present, the primary business activities of FMR and its subsidiaries are: (i) the provision of investment advisory, management, shareholder, investment information and assistance and certain fiduciary services for individual and institutional investors; (ii) the provision of securities brokerage services; (iii) the management and development of real estate; and (iv) the investment in and operation of a number of emerging businesses.

The Management Team 
 Founded in 1946, Fidelity has been known for its professional money management and comprehensive client services. Fidelity is one of the world s largest providers of financial services with assets under administration of 12.6 trillion, including managed assets of 4.9 trillion as of December 31, 2023. The portfolio management team has extensive experience in middle market lending and has sourced, underwritten and/or managed diverse credit and lending teams in a variety of market environments from the nascent cash flow lending markets of the early 2000 s, through the great financial crisis of 2007 to 2009 (the Great Financial Crisis ), during the recovery and growth of the 2010 s, and during the recent pandemic related disruptions. The Adviser emphasizes a consistent and disciplined underwriting process which is the foundation for its approach to portfolio construction. Leveraging proprietary research insights and performing granular credit and loan to value analysis for each investment are core tenets of the Adviser s credit philosophy. Focusing on capital preservation and minimizing volatility, the Adviser seeks to employ the same underwriting, due diligence and the Adviser s Direct Lending Investment Committee Direct Lending Investment Committee approval process for every investment. The Adviser believes that Fidelity s history and scale, combined with the portfolio management team s experience and strategy enable it to compete across the credit spectrum in the middle market. See Conflicts of Interest - Relationship among the Fund, the Adviser and the Portfolio Managers for more information about risks related to investing with an affiliate adviser. The Adviser s specific areas of differentiation that drive its competitive advantages are below: 
 Fidelity s multi-decade history and substantial scale in the credit markets: Fidelity has operated through the last twelve recessions, numerous crises, expansions and contractions during its 75-year history. Active in the credit markets since 1971, Fidelity has over 704 billion of credit investments fixed income assets under management as of December 31, 2023. Fidelity also offered its first high yield bond fund in 1977 and was the first mutual fund company to offer an open-ended fund focused on leverage loans in 2000. 

Dedicated team of seasoned middle market credit investors : The portfolio management team is comprised of professionals that have spent their entire careers in middle market lending. The portfolio managers average more than 20 years of experience, and the portfolio management team s capabilities include sourcing, underwriting and executing on middle market loans, and most importantly, actively managing credit portfolios through multiple cycles. This includes experience managing companies during periods of growth and distress including restructurings and bankruptcies, providing valuable foresight as the Direct Lending Investment Committee evaluates and approves new opportunities. The Adviser maintains in-depth oversight throughout the investment process and instills the culture of intense focus on capital preservation and hands-on portfolio management with a focus on proper risk mitigation throughout the life of an investment. 

Ability to operate at scale across the entire lending landscape: The Adviser seeks to offer compelling financing solutions for creditworthy issuers regardless of company size. This increases the opportunity set for the Fund and promotes the Adviser s selective investment approach, while providing reliable financing to companies as they scale. The Adviser s ability to offer attractive financing proposals for small to mid-market businesses as well as upper middle market companies also deepens the relationship with Sponsors, a source of investment opportunities for the Adviser. The Adviser intends to target issuers that the Adviser considers to be high quality regardless of size and provide financing structures that afford attractive risk adjusted returns for the Fund. 

Access to proprietary credit and equity research platform creates efficient and differentiated diligence: As part of Fidelity, the Adviser has access to FMR s extensive research platform that allows the Adviser to make more informed and efficient investment decisions. FMR has over 350 research professionals in North America, Europe and Asia that cover equities, fixed income and high yield markets. As part of the due diligence and underwriting process for each potential investment, the Adviser intends to review and analyze relevant FMR industry research and engage directly with the industry analysts. Using the proprietary insights, the Adviser expects to improve portfolio construction and risk mitigation, allowing it to potentially (i) gain conviction on investments or (ii) avoid investments that have subtle industry headwinds or competitive pressures, that might otherwise appear attractive. In addition to the portfolio management team s independent industry analysis and broad experience lending to middle market businesses, the Adviser s access to proprietary Fidelity research differentiates the platform and, we believe, translates into more efficient and informed decision making. 

6 

Disciplined, consistent underwriting process with risk adjusted approach: The Adviser employs a consistent and rigorous due diligence and underwriting process to assess each investment. Investments are reviewed in deal team structures where all investment professionals have overlapping responsibilities which is expected to improve process oversight and risk mitigation. The Adviser s philosophy and investment approach has been informed by the portfolio management team s extensive experience lending to middle market companies and utilizes a bottoms-up credit approach, with the primary focus being return of capital. For each potential investment, the Adviser will actively engage with company management and ownership and complete detailed credit and valuation analysis. While the Adviser will independently determine an investment thesis and identify key risks, the Adviser also benefits from significant third-party diligence commissioned for the majority of investments. Credit and valuation analysis are synthesized by the Adviser to determine the appropriate leverage and return profile, to ensure there is sufficient downside protection and risk is properly rewarded. Investments will be formally presented to the Adviser s Direct Lending Investment Committee twice at a minimum before final approval to invest is granted. 

Access to expert diligence professionals: The Adviser may independently commission third-party legal, environmental, insurance, industry, background check and financial diligence on investments where necessary. For every investment, the Adviser may engage its own independent legal counsel to perform legal due diligence, review and comment on loan documents and structures on the Adviser s behalf. The Adviser also will typically engage with Fidelity analysts regarding industry diligence for each investment and utilize consultants for additional industry insights as needed. The Adviser may engage environmental consultants to review any environmental diligence performed to provide insight into the risk exposure and ultimate liability. When acting as agent, the Adviser and/or its affiliates will typically engage insurance consultants to assess the borrower s insurance policies and if they are sufficient given the debt being provided and the borrower s operations, and to confirm the endorsements and insurance certificates properly reflect the liens and position as a lender. The Adviser may engage internal due diligence counterparts to screen and perform background checks on the borrower s legal entities, and the key management team members. The Adviser may also engage a third party financial due diligence provider to perform a quality of earnings if none is available from a private equity sponsor or the Adviser determines that an outside review is needed. The Adviser will review all available third-party diligence commissioned by the private equity sponsor. 

Diligent credit assessment process to optimize returns: Credit and valuation analysis are synthesized by the Adviser to determine the appropriate leverage and return profile, to ensure there is sufficient downside protection and risk is properly rewarded. Investments will be formally presented to the Direct Lending Investment Committee twice at a minimum before final approval to invest is granted. 

The Board of Trustees 
 Overall responsibility for the Fund s oversight rests with the Board. We have entered into the Advisory Agreement with the Adviser (the Advisory Agreement ), pursuant to which the Adviser will manage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Adviser and other service providers in our operations in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Fund s bylaws and applicable provisions of state and other laws. The Adviser will keep the Board well informed as to the Adviser s activities on our behalf and our investment operations and provide the Board with additional information as the Board may, from time to time, request. The Trustees are experienced executives who meet periodically throughout the year to oversee the Fund s activities, including, among other things, the oversight of our investment activities, the valuation of our assets, review of contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the Fund, oversight of our financing arrangements and corporate governance activities. The Board is currently composed of four members, three of whom are Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund or the Adviser as defined in the 1940 Act. 
 Market Opportunity 
 The private credit market has grown tenfold since the Great Financial Crisis and is projected to grow double-digit percentages in the near future. The consolidation of regional U.S. banks following the financial crisis and the enhanced regulations introduced by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), resulted in larger banks decreasing their willingness to issue and hold loans to middle-market companies, thus fueling the growth of direct lending. Direct lending is a subset of private credit that is frequently compared to public market options including leverage loans or broadly syndicated loans and high yield bonds. More recently, demand has been driven by key characteristics of the asset class summarized below. 
 Large and growing market : Fidelity research estimates the U.S. private credit market is at approximately 1.7 trillion (AUM) and finances mergers and acquisitions, recapitalization and refinance activity for the 200,000 middle market businesses that operate in the U.S. according to the National Center for the Middle Market. Private equity investing activity drives a significant portion of this volume. 

7 

The private credit market has expanded into areas traditionally served by the leverage loan and high yield markets : According to LCD and ICE BAML, from 2003 to 2023, the share of leverage loans with an issue size below 500,000,000 has declined from 51 to 7 , and similarly from 2003 to 2023, the share of high yield loans with an issue size below 500 million has declined from 68 to 15 . In both cases, direct lending is now regularly filling this gap for loans up to 500,000,000 and larger. 

Floating rate debt that provides a hedge against rising rates : The majority of direct lending investments are floating rate instruments so over time returns increase as interest rates rise. 

Predominantly senior secured positions that sit at the top of the capital structure : Direct lending investments offer enhanced collateral and covenant protections compared to the leveraged loans and high yield market that contribute to lower historical loss rates. 

Direct access to the Sponsors and ownership groups improves information flow : For direct lending investments, the sourcing and due diligence ties directly to the Sponsor or ownership group, so lenders have efficient access to information (frequently monthly financials vs. quarterly), can complete comprehensive and high-quality diligence, and develop bespoke financing solutions that better serve the needs of the middle-market companies. 

The foregoing information is with respect to past performance of certain markets and indices, only, and does not reflect the actual or expected performance of the Fund. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will achieve results resembling these metrics or that market circumstances in the future will be comparable. 
 Investment Strategy 
 The Adviser s investment strategy is credit driven with a focus on capital preservation. The Adviser seeks to employ a rigorous and consistent due diligence process when assessing each individual issuer. The Adviser intends to evaluate each issuers ownership and management team, business model, competitive differentiation, historical and projected financial performance, cost structure, key customers and key suppliers, and position within its industry. 
 The Adviser will utilize its expertise sourcing and investing in loans to private businesses while leveraging the proprietary industry research of the broader Fidelity platform when constructing the Fund s portfolio. Quantitative and qualitative factors will drive each investment decision to seek to achieve the Fund s stated investment objective. The Fund intends to invest across issuers, industries, geographies, and Sponsors or ownership groups. 
 The majority of the Fund s investments will be loans targeted at private U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Exchange Act, and public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250,000,000 Portfolio Investments ). The Fund may also invest to a lesser degree in non-U.S. companies. Specific investments may include: (a) directly originated first lien loans, senior secured revolving lines of credit, term loans and delayed draw term loans, (b) directly originated second lien, last out senior, secured or unsecured mezzanine term loans and delayed draw term loans, (c) club deals (investments generally comprised of a small group of lenders), and broadly syndicated leveraged loans (investments generally arranged or underwritten by investment banks or other intermediaries), and (d) other debt (collectively referred to as Private Credit ). We may also invest to a lesser degree in equity linked instruments (may include debt with warrants, preferred equity investments, or equity co-investments). The Adviser may lead and structure the transaction as sole-lender, as the agent of a club credit facility (a group of similar direct lenders that invest in the same tranches), or may participate as a non-agent investor in a large club or syndicated transactions. 
 Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80 of its total assets in Private Credit. If the Fund changes its 80 test, the Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60 days prior notice of such change. The Fund will also invest at least 70 of its total assets in investments that meet regulatory requirements of the BDC structure, which will generally include investments in companies that are generally private and may be backed by a Sponsor but may also include investments in small capitalization public companies or companies that are Non-Sponsor. The Adviser will directly originate credit opportunities from a large universe of Sponsors, intermediaries and other direct lenders, as well as internal Fidelity resources. 
 Targeted borrowers will operate within a wide range of industries. Leveraging Fidelity s proprietary industry research and the Adviser s expertise, the Fund will primarily invest in industries where the Adviser s portfolio management team has deep experience with similarly situated companies. The Adviser will target investments structured as first lien senior secured and unitranche credit facilities, while also taking advantage of opportunistic investments in other parts of the capital structure, including last out loans, second lien loans, mezzanine and other junior debt loans, as well as equity investments. 
 8 

The Fund may enter into hedging transactions, which may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of the Fund s portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. The Fund may also receive or purchase warrants or rights. 
 Most of the investments that the Fund intends to invest in are unrated or rated below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moody s Investor Service, Inc. or lower than BBB- by S P Global Ratings), which are often referred to as leveraged loans, high yield or junk debt investments and may be considered high risk or speculative compared to debt investments that are rated investment grade. Such issuers are considered more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal, and such risk of default could reduce the Fund s net asset value and income distributions to shareholders. They may also be illiquid and difficult to value. 
 The Adviser will seek collateral packages in connection with the Fund s secured investments that include liens on the borrower s assets and a pledge of the borrower s stock. In addition, the Adviser expects to seek investment structures that include covenant packages that measure the borrower s key performance metrics but will also be permitted to invest in loans that would not include maintenance covenants. Loans will usually have stated terms of five to seven years, but the expected average life of such securities is usually between three to four years and may contain scheduled amortization payments and/or mandatory excess cash flow payments to reduce exposure and risk over the life of the investment. 
 The Fund will generally seek to invest in loans that carry variable (i.e., floating interest rates. In addition to the cash yields received on its loans from principal and interest payments, the Fund will seek to invest in loans that generally pay additional fees, including but not limited to, closing fees, arrangement fees, prepayment premiums, or amendment fees. In certain cases, loan investments will have equity enhancement features, which may be in the form of warrants or other equity-related securities that are designed to provide the opportunity for capital appreciation. 
 To seek to enhance returns, the Fund intends to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the limitations set forth in the 1940 Act, which currently allows the Fund to borrow up to a 2x debt to equity ratio. 
 The Fund will borrow money for investment and cash management purposes. In determining whether to borrow money, the Fund will analyze the financial flexibility, maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to the Fund s investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds to make investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds would be borne by the shareholders indirectly through their interests in the Fund. 
 Because the Fund is classified as non-diversified, the Adviser may invest a significant percentage of the Fund s assets in a single issuer. 
 The Fund s investments are subject to a number of risks. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Cash Management 
 The Fund may hold uninvested cash or may invest it in cash equivalents such as money market securities, repurchase agreements, or shares of short-term bond or money market funds, including shares of Fidelity Central funds. Generally, these securities offer less potential for gains than other types of securities. 
 Central Funds 
 In addition to cash management, the Fund may hold Central funds to gain exposure to certain fixed income securities. Central funds are special types of investment vehicles created by Fidelity for use by the Fidelity funds and other advisory clients. Central funds are used to invest in particular security types or investment disciplines, or for cash management. Central funds incur certain costs related to their investment activity (such as custodial fees and expenses), but generally do not pay additional management fees. The investment results of the portions of a Fidelity fund s assets invested in the Central funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds.

Investment Selection 
 One of the critical success factors in private credit is access to a deep pipeline of investment opportunities. Based on the portfolio management team s extensive experience, the Adviser intends to employ a multi-faceted approach to sourcing transactions through a large network of private equity firms, intermediaries, as well as other direct lending firms. The Adviser believes that Fidelity s scale and track record in the liquid markets, combined with the portfolio management team s long tenure in direct lending, will provide unique and rich access to high credit quality investment opportunities. 
 Private equity acquisition activity drives a substantial amount of private credit volume in the middle-market, and Fidelity has longstanding relationships with a diverse set of Sponsors that invest across a broad set of industries, geographies and business models. The Adviser expects to enhance these relationships and bolster its sourcing efforts with its differentiated and efficient credit review process that is honed by a team of experienced credit professionals. 
 Lastly, Fidelity s existing relationships with liquid issuers, some of which are owned by the same mix of Sponsors, and size in the liquid markets, provide the Adviser with differentiated investment opportunities. The Adviser can leverage these relationships to provide value-added capabilities and better execution on loans in the liquid markets, which can translate into a more robust pipeline of private credit investment opportunities for the Fund. 
 The Adviser seeks to employ a disciplined and rigorous process for all credit investments, which includes the following key features: 
 Underwriting the borrower : Performing detailed credit and valuation analysis; analyzing historical trends and business drivers; assessing management; and developing a deep understanding of the business operations and cost structure. 

Analyzing the industry : Leveraging Fidelity s broad research and analysts platform and Sponsor provided third party industry studies (when available) to uncover macro and micro industry forces; understanding the competitive dynamics and market forces; validating the growth and outlook; and assessing public and private competitors. 

Underwriting the Sponsor or ownership group : Evaluating investment performance; understanding track record and willingness to invest follow-on capital in times of stress; assessing available dry powder, due diligence quality and relevant sector expertise. 

Confirming investment thesis : Validating the sustainability of competitive advantages, revenues and margins; confirming diversity of products, customers, services, suppliers and institutionalized value. 

Evaluating the credit structure : Analyzing ability to repay debt; performing loan-to-value analysis and downside case scenarios; and evaluating appropriate risk and reward for a proposed investment. 

During the credit underwriting process, the deal team will compile and present diligence findings to the Adviser s Direct Lending Investment Committee at least once before issuing a term sheet and a second time before closing. The Adviser s focus is on downside protection so the deal team and Direct Lending Investment Committee are expected to spend substantial time understanding and validating various downside scenarios, exit options, and structural protections in every investment seeking to ensure adequate cushion. 
 Following the closing of an investment, one or several members of the deal team that originated the loan on behalf of the Fund are expected to manage the portfolio moving forward. As part of the portfolio management process, the investment professional seeks to assess liquidity needs daily or weekly, evaluate financial performance on a monthly basis for the majority of accounts (a minority may only report quarterly), scrutinize financial covenant calculations on a quarterly basis (if applicable) and maintain frequent dialogue with the company management and Sponsor regarding company performance, strategic initiatives, acquisitions or other business items. 
 Portfolio Monitoring and Risk Management 
 The Adviser has a strong culture focused on risk management, with significant dedicated resources committed to that effort. The Adviser firmly believes that one of the most powerful risk management tools occurs at the individual investment level. The regular monitoring of a portfolio s investments seeks to ensure that the risk/return ratio has not become unfavorable to help avoid unnecessary capital losses, and the Adviser believes it is a key component to positive long-term performance. Frequent monitoring and oversight are conducted by the portfolio managers to ensure that each position is still an attractive investment. At the portfolio level, the portfolio managers ensure that the overall risk profile, diversification, and positioning is consistent with the Fund s objectives. There is also considerable executive oversight with regular, systematic portfolio reviews with senior management. 
 10 

Systems and technology play a critical role in portfolio monitoring and risk management. The Adviser s proprietary systems enable research professionals to get real-time access to risk measures and exposures across multiple dimensions, among other things. Compliance modules are also systematically linked to the trading platform as another mechanism to minimize risk. 
 Risk management efforts are further bolstered by various additional teams of resources. For example, a dedicated compliance team monitors all portfolios and investment professionals; a dedicated counterparty risk team monitors all trading and business counterparties; and a dedicated legal team is able to support the Adviser across a variety of legal questions. 
 Direct Lending Investment Committee 
 The investment activities of the Fund are under the direction of the Direct Lending Investment Committee and the Board. The Direct Lending Investment Committee is currently comprised of the Fund s three portfolio managers: David Gaito, Therese Icuss and Jeffrey Scott. Additionally, the President of Fidelity Investments High Income and Alternatives Group (the High Income and Alternatives Group ), and the Chief Investment Officer of the High Income and Alternatives Group meet with the Direct Lending Investment Committee frequently to discuss the pipeline of opportunities and they have the authority to decline any opportunity at any point at their discretion. The day-to-day activities of the Fund are overseen by the Fund s portfolio managers, each of whom is an officer or employee of the Adviser or its affiliate. 
 Allocation of Investment Opportunities 
 General 
 The Adviser and its affiliates provide investment management services to registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that may be established from time to time. 
 The Adviser will share any investment and sale opportunities with its other clients and the Fund in accordance with the Advisers Act and firm-wide allocation policies. Subject to the Advisers Act and as further set forth in this Form 10-K, certain other clients may receive certain priority or other allocation rights with respect to certain investments, subject to various conditions set forth in such other clients respective governing agreements. 
 The Adviser s policies will seek to ensure the equitable allocation of such investment opportunities among us and other clients over time. In cases where an investment may potentially be appropriate for several clients, the Adviser makes a determination of the appropriateness of the investment opportunity for a particular client and allocates an investment opportunity among eligible clients based on a variety of factors related to each such client the Adviser deems relevant (including, without limitation, the client s investment objectives and focus, available capital, the client s existing portfolio, portfolio company restrictions, targeted rate of return, minimum and maximum investment size requirements, transaction structure, cash flow considerations, risk considerations, tax implications, criteria established by the Board Board-Established Criteria (if any), legal and regulatory requirements, whether a related investment opportunity has already been made available to the client, investment limitations and other factors). In cases where an investment opportunity is being evaluated on behalf of, and may be appropriate for, both us and another client and falls outside of the allocation methodology, the Adviser will generally consult with an allocation, conflicts or similar internal committee or sub-committee to decide on an appropriate allocation of a particular investment opportunity as between us and such other client, which may take into account, among other things, the factors discussed above. 
 In addition, as a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act, the Fund is subject to certain limitations relating to co-investments and joint transactions with affiliates, which are likely in certain circumstances to limit the Fund s ability to make investments or enter into other transactions alongside other clients. 
 11 

Trade Aggregation and Allocation 
 Allocation of investment instruments that are traded by FMR s High Income, Fixed Income or Equity trading desks are governed by the respective trade allocation policies reasonably designed to seek to ensure that clients are not disadvantaged in the aggregation and allocation of securities over time. To the extent a particular investment in a liquid credit instrument (e.g., broadly syndicated loan), is suitable for both us and other clients, it is the practice of the Adviser, when appropriate, to bunch orders of various accounts, including those of us and the other clients and, in certain instances, proprietary accounts of the Adviser or its affiliates, for order entry and execution. Bunched orders may be executed through one or more broker-dealers. The allotment of trades among brokers is based on a variety of factors, which may include price, order size, the time of order, the security and market activity. A bunched trade executed with a particular broker is generally allocated pro rata among the accounts that are participating in the bunched trade until any account has been filled, after which the trade is allocated pro rata among the remaining accounts. Each broker s execution of a bunched order may be at a price different from another broker s bunched order execution price for the same security. Simultaneous portfolio transactions for us and one or more other clients may decrease the prices received and increase the prices required to be paid by us for sales and purchases. 
 The Adviser and its affiliates that execute trades on behalf of us and other clients have established allocation policies for their various accounts (including proprietary accounts) and securities types e.g. , equity, fixed income, and high income) to ensure allocations are appropriate given the clients differing investment objectives and other considerations. These policies also apply to initial and secondary offerings. When, in the opinion of the executing party, the supply or demand is insufficient under the circumstances to satisfy all outstanding trade orders, across all securities types the amount executed generally is distributed among participating accounts based on account asset size (for purchases), and security position size (for sales), or otherwise according to the allocation policies. With limited exceptions, the trading systems contain rules that allocate trades on an automated basis in accordance with these policies. Generally, any exceptions to these policies i.e. , special allocations) must be approved by senior trading and compliance personnel and documented. 
 Co-Investment Relief 
 We and the Adviser have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons in negotiated transactions, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to such order, the Fund s Board may establish Board-Established Criteria clearly defining co-investment opportunities in which the Fund will have the opportunity to participate with other public or private affiliated funds that target similar assets. If an investment falls within the Board-Established Criteria, the Adviser must offer an opportunity for the Fund to participate. We may determine to participate or not to participate, depending on whether the Adviser determines that the investment is appropriate for the Fund e.g. , based on investment strategy). The co-investment would generally be allocated to us and the other affiliated funds that target similar assets in accordance with allocation policies and procedures described above. If the Adviser determines that such investment is not appropriate for us, the investment will not be allocated to us, but the Adviser will be required to report such investment and the rationale for its determination for us to not participate in the investment to the Board at the next quarterly board meeting. 
 Competition 
 The business of investing in debt investments is highly competitive and involves a high degree of uncertainty. Market competition for investment opportunities includes traditional lending institutions, including commercial and investment banks, as well as a growing number of non-traditional participants, such as hedge funds, private equity funds, mezzanine funds, and other private investors, as well as BDCs, and debt-focused competitors, such as issuers of collateralized loan obligations CLOs and other structured loan funds. In addition, given the Fund s target investment size and investment type, the Adviser expects a large number of competitors for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may have access to greater amounts of capital and to capital that may be committed for longer periods of time or may have different return thresholds than the Fund, and thus these competitors may have advantages not shared by the Fund. In addition, competitors may have incurred, or may in the future incur, leverage to finance their debt investments at levels or on terms more favorable than those available to the Fund. Furthermore, competitors may offer loan terms that are more favorable to borrowers, such as less onerous borrower financial and other covenants, borrower rights to cure defaults, and other terms more favorable to borrowers than current or historical norms. Strong competition for investments could result in fewer investment opportunities for the Fund, as certain of these competitors have established or are establishing investment vehicles that target the same or similar investments that the Fund intends to purchase. 
 12 

Over the past several years, many investment funds have been formed with investment objectives similar to those of the Fund, and many such existing funds have grown in size and have added larger successor funds to their platform. These and other investors may make competing offers for investment opportunities identified by the Adviser which may affect the Fund s ability to participate in attractive investment opportunities and/or cause the Fund to incur additional risks when competing for investment opportunities. Moreover, identifying attractive investment opportunities is difficult and involves a high degree of uncertainty. The Adviser may identify an investment that presents an attractive investment opportunity but may not be able to complete such investment in a manner that meets the objectives of the Fund. The Fund may incur significant expenses in connection with the identification of investment opportunities and investigating other potential investments that are ultimately not consummated, including expenses related to due diligence, transportation and legal, accounting and other professional services as well as the fees of other third-party advisers. 
 Non-Exchange Traded, Perpetual-Life BDC 
 The Fund intends to operate as a non-exchange traded, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. The Fund uses the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration whose Common Shares are intended to be sold by the Fund on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to the Fund s NAV per share. In our perpetual-life structure, we may, at our discretion, offer investors an opportunity to repurchase their shares on a quarterly basis, but we are not obligated to offer to repurchase any in any particular quarter. 
 We believe that our perpetual nature enables us to execute a patient and opportunistic strategy and be able to invest across different market environments. This may reduce the risk of the Fund being a forced seller of assets in market downturns compared to non-perpetual funds. While we may consider a liquidity event at any time in the future, we currently do not intend to undertake a liquidity event, and we are not obligated by our charter or otherwise to effect a liquidity event at any time. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund may, at any time, determine to pursue a sale of all or substantially all of the Fund s assets to, a purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of, or other liquidity event with, another entity or a transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or sale of Common Shares in each case for consideration of either cash and/or publicly listed securities of the acquirer, in each case subject to any required approvals and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Potential acquirers could include other BDCs and entities that are not BDCs, in each case, that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliates or by unaffiliated third-parties. The Fund is not a subsidiary of or consolidated with Fidelity. 
 The Fund reserves the right to involuntarily redeem an investor s Shares in the case of actual or suspected threatening conduct or actual or suspected fraudulent, illegal or suspicious activity by the investor or any other individual associated with the investor s account. Accordingly, an investor s Shares will be sold at the NAV, minus any applicable shareholder fees, calculated on the day the Fund exercises its right as mentioned above. 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and disclosure requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 
 have an auditor attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 

submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes pursuant to the say on frequency and say on pay provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the say on golden parachute provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010; or 

disclose certain executive compensation related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 

13 

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies. This means that an emerging growth company can delay adopting certain accounting standards until such standards are otherwise applicable to private companies. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of: (1) the last date of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of 1,235,000,000 or more; (2) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined under Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. 
 We do not believe that being an emerging growth company will have a significant impact on our business or our Offering. We have elected to opt in to the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards available to emerging growth companies. Also, because we are not a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer under Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and will not be for so long as our Common Shares are not traded on a securities exchange, we will not be subject to auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act even once we are no longer an emerging growth company. In addition, so long as we are externally managed by the Adviser and we do not directly compensate our executive officers, or reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for the salaries, bonuses, benefits and severance payments for persons who also serve as one of our executive officers or as an executive officer of the Adviser, we do not expect to include disclosures relating to executive compensation in our periodic reports or proxy statements and, as a result, do not expect to be required to seek shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachute compensation arrangements pursuant to Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act. 
 Employees 
 We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser or its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administrator or its affiliates pursuant to the Administration Agreement between the Fund and the Administrator (the Administration Agreement ). Each of our executive officers is employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Our day-to-day investment operations will be managed by the Adviser. The services necessary for the sourcing and administration of our investment portfolio will be provided by investment professionals employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. The portfolio management team will focus on origination, non-originated investments and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments. 
 Regulation as a BDC 
 The following discussion is a general summary of the material prohibitions and descriptions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs. 
 Qualifying Assets . Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than Qualifying Assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, Qualifying Assets represent at least 70 of the Fund s total assets. The principal categories of Qualifying Assets relevant to our business are any of the following: 
 (1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an Eligible Portfolio Company (as defined below), or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an Eligible Portfolio Company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An Eligible Portfolio Company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 

(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 

(c) satisfies any of the following: 

(i) does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 

(ii) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than 250,000,000; 

14 

(iii) is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies, including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the Eligible Portfolio Company; or 

(iv) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than 4,000,000 and capital and surplus of not less than 2,000,000. 

(2) Securities of any Eligible Portfolio Company controlled by the Fund. 

(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 

(4) Securities of an Eligible Portfolio Company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the Fund already owns 60 of the outstanding equity of the Eligible Portfolio Company. 

(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

In addition, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. 
 Significant Managerial Assistance . A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as Qualifying Assets for the purpose of the 70 test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its trustees, officers, service providers e.g. , the Adviser) or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company s officers or other organizational or financial guidance. 
 Temporary Investments . Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets (including directly originated loans and broadly syndicated loans, as described above), the Fund s investments can consist of cash, cash equivalents, money market funds (including shares of Fidelity Central funds or other funds that are advised by the Adviser or its affiliates), U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which are referred to herein, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70 of the Fund s assets would be qualifying assets. 
 The Fund may invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates. Depending on the circumstances (which exclude investments in money market funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates, from which the Adviser or its affiliates may retain any additional management or other fees), the Adviser will contractually waive either (1) its management fee payable by the Fund or (2) up to a portion of its management fee payable by the Fund in an amount equal to such underlying fund s management fee rate multiplied by the Fund s average monthly invested balance in such underlying fund for such month. 
 Warrants . Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the issuance, terms and amount of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares that it may have outstanding at any time. In particular, the amount of shares that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase shares cannot exceed 25 of the BDC s total outstanding shares. 
 15 

Leverage and Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio . We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our Common Shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, would at least equal 150 immediately after each such issuance. On September 16, 2022, our sole shareholder approved the adoption of this 150 threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and such election became effective the following day. As defined in the 1940 Act, asset coverage of 150 means that for every 100 of net assets we hold, we may raise 200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We will also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. 
 We intend to establish one or more credit facilities and/or subscription facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. It is anticipated that any such credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to be determined spreads over SOFR (or other applicable reference rate). We cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to enter into a credit facility. Shareholders will indirectly bear the costs associated with any borrowings under a credit facility or otherwise. In connection with a credit facility or other borrowings, lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and may ask to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. In addition, from time to time, our losses on leveraged investments may result in the liquidation of other investments held by us and may result in additional drawdowns to repay such amounts. 
 We may also create leverage by securitizing our assets (including in CLOs) and retaining the equity portion of the securitized vehicle. See Risk Factors Forming CLOs Risk . We may also from time to time make secured loans of our marginable securities to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions. 
 Code of Ethics . We and the Adviser have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code are permitted to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements. 
 Affiliated Transactions . We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from conducting certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Trustees who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We and the Adviser have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 Other . We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act and be subject to the periodic reporting and related requirements of the Exchange Act. 
 We are also required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we will be prohibited from protecting any Trustee or officer against any liability to our shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person s office. 
 We are also required to designate a chief compliance officer CCO and to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. 
 We are not permitted to change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67 or more of such company s shares present at a meeting if more than 50 of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50 of the outstanding shares of such company. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds of our Offering of Common Shares, (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. 
 16 

Our primary uses of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies and other investments, (ii) the cost of operations (including paying FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator)), (iii) cost of any borrowings or other financing arrangements, (iv) funding repurchases under our share repurchase program, and (v) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 The Adviser and/or its affiliates have agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf through the date on which we broke escrow for our Offering. The Fund will be obligated to reimburse the Adviser and/or its affiliates, as applicable, for such advanced expenses only if certain conditions are met. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. See Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. 
 Advisory Agreement 
 The Adviser will provide management services to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the following: 
 determining the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes in accordance with our investment objective, policies and restrictions; 

identifying investment opportunities and making investment decisions for us, including negotiating the terms of investments in, and dispositions of, portfolio securities and other instruments on our behalf; 

monitoring our investments; 

performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; 

exercising voting rights in respect of portfolio securities and other investments for us; 

serving on, and exercising observer rights for, boards of directors and similar committees of our portfolio companies; 

negotiating, obtaining and managing financing facilities and other forms of leverage; and 

providing us with such other investment advisory and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of capital. 

The Adviser s services under the Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities, and it intends to do so, so long as its services to us are not impaired. 
 We will pay the Adviser a fee for its services under the Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. 
 Management Fee 
 The management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, net assets mean the Fund s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 
 On August 9, 2023, the Adviser decided to extend the waiver of the Fund s management fee and incentive fee based on income until December 31, 2023. Previously, the Adviser had agreed to waive the management fee and incentive fee based on income for the first six months following the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which occurred on March 13, 2023. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of our income and a portion is based on a percentage of our capital gains, each as described below. 
 On August 9, 2023, the Adviser decided to extend the waiver of the Fund s management fee and incentive fee based on income until December 31, 2023. Previously, the Adviser had agreed to waive the management fee and incentive fee based on income for the first six months following the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which occurred on March 13, 2023. 
 17 

Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 The portion based on our income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to each class of the Fund s Common Shares. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fee, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement with our administrator, any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and shareholder servicing and /or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount OID ), debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediate preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of 1.25 per quarter (5.00 annualized). 
 We will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to the applicable share class do not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.25 per quarter (5.0 annualized); 

100 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to the applicable share class, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.43 as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately 12.5 of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.43 in any calendar quarter; and 

12.5 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to the applicable share class, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 (5.72 annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 12.5 of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 

Percentage of each Class s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
 Allocated to Quarterly Incentive Fee 
 These calculations are pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a calendar quarter in which we incur an overall loss taking into account capital account losses. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in excess of the quarterly hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that calendar quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 
 18 

Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals: 
 12.5 of cumulative realized capital gains attributable to the applicable share class from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Each year, the fee paid for the capital gains incentive fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee by the applicable share class for all prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof. 
 For purposes of computing the Fund s incentive fee on income and the incentive fee on capital gains, the calculation methodology will look through derivative financial instruments or swaps as if we owned the reference assets directly. The fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 Board Approval of the Advisory Agreement 
 At its November 2023 meeting, the Board unanimously determined to renew the Fund s Agreements. In reaching its determination, the Board considered all factors it believed relevant, including (i) the nature, extent, and quality of the services provided to the Fund and its shareholders (including the investment performance of the Fund); (ii) the competitiveness relative to peer funds of the Fund s management fee and the total expense ratio; (iii) the total costs of the services provided by and the profits realized by FDS and its affiliates (Fidelity) from its relationships with the Fund; and (iv) the extent to which, if any, economies of scale exist and are realized as the Fund grows, and whether any economies of scale are appropriately shared with Fund shareholders. The Board s decision to renew the Agreements was not based on any single factor. 
 Nature, Extent, and Quality of Services Provided 
 The Board considered Fidelity s staffing as it relates to the Fund, including the backgrounds of investment personnel of Fidelity, and also considered Fidelity s implementation of the Fund s investment program. The Board also had discussions with members of the portfolio management team. 
 Resources Dedicated to Investment Management and Support Services. The Board reviewed the general qualifications and capabilities of Fidelity s investment staff, including its size, education, experience, and resources, as well as Fidelity s approach to training and managing investment personnel. The Board noted the resources devoted to Fidelity s global investment organization and that Fidelity s analysts have extensive resources, tools and capabilities that allow them to conduct sophisticated quantitative and fundamental analysis, as well as credit analysis of issuers, counterparties and guarantors. Further, the Board considered that Fidelity s investment professionals have sufficient access to global information and data so as to provide competitive investment results over time, and that those professionals also have access to sophisticated tools that permit them to assess portfolio construction and risk and performance attribution characteristics continuously, as well as to transmit new information and research conclusions rapidly around the world. Additionally, in its deliberations, the Board considered Fidelity s trading, risk management, compliance, cybersecurity, and technology and operations capabilities and resources, which are integral parts of the investment management process. 

Shareholder and Administrative Services. The Board considered: (i) the nature, extent, quality, and cost of advisory, administrative, and shareholder services to be performed by Fidelity under the Advisory Agreement and under separate agreements covering transfer agency, pricing and bookkeeping, and securities lending services for the Fund; (ii) the nature and extent of Fidelity s supervision of third-party service providers, principally custodians, subcustodians, and pricing vendors; and (iii) the resources devoted by Fidelity to, and the record of compliance with, the Fund s compliance policies and procedures. The Board also considered the Fund s securities lending activities and any payments made to Fidelity relating to securities lending. 

19 

The Board noted that the growth of Fund assets over time across the complex allows Fidelity to reinvest in the development of services designed to enhance the value and convenience of the Fidelity funds as investment vehicles. These services include 24-hour access to account information and market information over the internet and through telephone representatives, investor education materials and asset allocation tools. 
 Investment Performance . The Board took into account discussions that occur with representatives of Fidelity, and reports that it receives, at board meetings throughout the year relating to Fund investment performance. In this regard the Board noted that as part of regularly scheduled reports to the Board on Fund performance, the Board considered annualized return information for the Fund since inception. 

In addition to reviewing absolute Fund performance, Board periodically considers the appropriateness of Fund performance metrics in evaluating the results achieved. The Board generally gives greater weight to Fund performance over longer time periods than over shorter time periods. 
 Based on its review, the Board concluded that the nature, extent, and quality of services to be provided to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement should benefit the shareholders of the Fund. 
 Competitiveness of Management Fee and Total Expense Ratio 
 In reviewing the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered the Fund s management fee rate and the total expense ratio of Class I Common Shares of the Fund. Because the Fund was operating for a small portion of the reporting period, the total net expenses of Class I Common Shares considered by the Board were based on estimates. The Board noted that there is a limited number of public, unlisted competitors against which to assess the competitiveness of the Fund s fees. Fidelity identified a small number of competitor funds that are similar to the Fund. The Board noted that the Fund s management fee is the same as the contractual base management fee rate of the selected competitors. The Board also noted that estimated total expenses for Class I shares, a representative class of the Fund, ranked in the range of the identified competitors with an equal number of competitors being above and below Class I s total expenses. The Board noted the difficulty in comparing total expense ratios across the identified competitors due to varying incentive fees, interest expense on borrowed funds, operating expenses, and the extent of expense reimbursement. The Board noted that the Fund s Advisory Agreement also includes an incentive fee that is charged based both on income and on realized capital gains, but, noted that, given the Fund s limited operations, it would be able to evaluate the effects of the incentive fee in connection with future renewals of the Fund s Advisory Agreement. The Board noted that the Fund is contractually limiting certain fund-level operating expenses to 0.70 (on an annualized basis) of the Fund s NAV for the twelve month period commencing the date of Agreement, September 23, 2022, and unless terminated, for each successive one year period. 
 The Board also noted that FDS had contractually agreed to waive the management fee and income component of the incentive fee through December 31, 2023. 
 Based on its review, the Board concluded that the Fund s management fee and the total expense ratio of Class I shares of the Fund were reasonable in light of the services that the Fund and its shareholders receive and the other factors considered. 
 Costs of the Services and Profitability 
 The Board considered the revenues earned and the expenses incurred by Fidelity in conducting the business of developing, marketing, distributing, managing, administering and servicing the Fund and servicing the Fund s shareholders. The Board considered the level of Fidelity s profits in respect of all the Fidelity funds it oversees. The Board noted, however, that the profitability information did not include the Fund given that the Fund did not commence operations until after calendar year 2022, which was the period for the profitability report. 
 The Board also reviewed Fidelity s non-fund businesses and potential indirect benefits such businesses may have received as a result of their association with Fidelity s fund business (i.e., fall-out benefits) as well as cases where Fidelity s affiliates may benefit from the funds business. The Board considered areas where potential indirect benefits to the Fidelity funds from their relationships with Fidelity may exist. 
 The Board considered the costs of the services provided by and the lack of meaningful profits realized by Fidelity in connection with the operation of the funds overseen by the Board and was satisfied that the profitability was not excessive. 
 20 

Economies of Scale 
 The Board considered whether there have been economies of scale in respect of the management of the funds overseen by the Board, whether the funds (including the Fund) have appropriately benefited from any such economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of any further economies of scale. It noted that, notwithstanding the entrepreneurial risk associated with a new fund, the management fee was at a level normally associated, by comparison with competitors, with very high fund net assets, and Fidelity asserted to the Board that the level of the Fund s advisory fee anticipates economies of scale at lower asset levels even before, if ever, economies of scale are achieved. The Board also noted that the Fund and its shareholders would have access to the very considerable number and variety of services available through Fidelity. 
 The Board concluded that economies of scale, if any, are being appropriately shared between Fund shareholders and Fidelity. 
 Conclusion 
 Based on its evaluation of all of the conclusions noted above, and after considering all factors it believed relevant, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, concluded that the advisory fee arrangements are fair and reasonable in light of all of the surrounding circumstances, and that the Fund s Agreements should be renewed through November 30, 2024. 
 Administration Agreement 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides, or oversees the performance of, administrative and compliance services necessary for the fund operations, including, but not limited to, maintaining financial records, overseeing the calculation of NAV, compliance monitoring (including diligence and oversight of our other service providers), preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC and other regulators, preparing materials and coordinating meetings of our Board, managing the payment of expenses, the payment and receipt of funds for investments and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others and providing office space, equipment and office services. In consideration of the administrative services provided by the Administrator to the Fund, the Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee of 0.02666 (0.32 on an annualized basis) of the Fund s month-end NAV and reimburses the Administrator for the costs and expenses of the Fund incurred by the Administrator. The fee paid to the Administrator is an expense paid out of the Fund s net assets and is computed based on the value of the net assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month (including any assets in respect of Common Shares that are repurchased as of the end of the quarter). Business Day shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day when banks in the State of New York are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to remain closed. 
 From time to time, FDS, in its capacity as both the Adviser and the Administrator or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. Unless such expenses are specifically assumed by the Adviser, Administrator or its affiliates under the Advisory Agreement or Administration Agreement, the Fund will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on the Fund s behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. 
 Costs and expenses of FDS in its capacity as both the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by the Fund will be reasonably allocated to the Fund on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator. 
 21 

Certain Terms of the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement 
 Each of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement has been approved by the Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, each of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first becomes effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the Independent Trustees. We may terminate the Advisory Agreement upon 60 days written notice, and the Administration Agreement upon 120 days written notice, without payment of any penalty. The decision to terminate either agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a majority of our outstanding voting securities, which means the lesser of (1) 67 or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50 of the outstanding voting securities. In addition, without payment of any penalty, the Adviser may terminate the Advisory Agreement upon 120 days written notice and the Administrator may terminate the Administration Agreement upon 120 days written notice. The Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment. 
 FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the matters to which the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, respectively, relate, provided that FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) shall not be protected against any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which it would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations disabling conduct ). Each of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement provide that, absent disabling conduct, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and as the Administrator) and their officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with either of them (collectively, the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of FDS s services under the Advisory Agreement and FDS s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as adviser or administrator for us. FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) shall not be liable under their respective agreements with us or otherwise for any loss due to the mistake, action, inaction, negligence, dishonesty, fraud or bad faith of any broker or other agent; provided, that such broker or other agent shall have been selected, engaged or retained and monitored by FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) in good faith, unless such action or inaction was made by reason of disabling conduct, or in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, where FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) had reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful. In addition, we will not provide for indemnification of an Indemnified Party for any liability or loss suffered by such Indemnified Party, nor will we provide that an Indemnified Party be held harmless for any loss or liability suffered by us, unless: (1) we have determined, in good faith, that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interest; (2) the Indemnified Party was acting on our behalf or performing services for us; (3) such liability or loss was not the result of negligence or misconduct, in the case that the Indemnified Party is FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator), an affiliate of FDS or one of our officers; and (4) the indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our net assets and not from our shareholders. 
 Payment of Our Expenses Under the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreements 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We will bear the following costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions: 
 1. investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement Advisory Fees 

2. the fee paid to the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement Administration Fees and 

3. other expenses of the Fund s operations and transactions. 

From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and as the Administrator) or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf that are Fund expenses. From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. 
 22 

Costs and expenses of FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and the Administrator) that are eligible for reimbursement by the Fund will be reasonably allocated to the Fund on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, for the twelve month period commencing the date of Agreement, September 23, 2022, and unless terminated, for each successive one year period, the Adviser is obligated to advance all of our Other Operating Expenses (including organizational and offering expenses) to the effect that such expenses do not exceed 0.70 (on an annualized basis) of the Fund's NAV. Any Required Expense Payment must be paid by the Adviser to the Fund in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds and/or offset against amounts due from the Fund to the Adviser or its affiliates. Other Operating Expenses means the Fund s organization and offering expenses, professional fees (including accounting, legal, and auditing fees), custodian and transfer agent fees, third party valuation agent fees, insurance costs, trustee fees, Administration Fees, and other general and administrative expenses. 
 The Adviser may elect to pay, at such times as the Adviser determines, certain expenses on our behalf (each, a Voluntary Expense Payment and together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Fund. Any Voluntary Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to us in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than 45 days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from us to the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Fund s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), we shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Fund within 3 years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Fund shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) our net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) our net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to us on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 
 No Reimbursement Payment for any month shall be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share declared by the Fund at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, (2) the Fund s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relate, or (3) the Fund s Other Operating Expenses at the time of such Reimbursement Payment exceeds 0.70 of the Fund s NAV. Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365-day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder servicing fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to the Adviser, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and interest expense, by the Fund s net assets. Operating Expenses means all of the Fund s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with GAAP for investment companies. 
 As of March 13, 2023, the Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive its right to receive any Reimbursement Payment for any Excess Operating Funds incurred in any month prior to revocation. Any such amounts shall not be considered unreimbursed Expense Payments reimbursable in future months pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. This voluntary arrangement can be terminated at any time, upon thirty days prior written notice to the Fund. 
 The Fund s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Fund on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. 
 23 

Distributions 
 We expect to pay regular monthly distributions and declared our first distribution on April 26, 2023. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board, considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Delaware law. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time. 
 Our Board s discretion as to the payment of distributions will be directed, in substantial part, by its determination to cause us to comply with the RIC requirements. To maintain our treatment as a RIC, we generally are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of investment company taxable income. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations . 
 The per share amount of distributions on Class S, Class D and Class I shares generally differ because of different class-specific shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees that are deducted from the gross distributions for each share class. Specifically, distributions on Class S shares will be lower than Class D shares and Class I shares, and distributions on Class D shares will be lower than Class I shares because we are required to pay higher ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to the Class S shares (compared to Class D shares and Class I shares), and we are required to pay higher ongoing shareholder servicing fees with respect to Class D shares (compared to Class I shares). 
 Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fees 
 The following table shows the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees we pay the Managing Dealer with respect to the Class S, Class D and Class I on an annualized basis as a percentage of our NAV for such class. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month. 

Shareholder Servicing and/ or Distribution Fee as a of NAV 

Class S shares 

0.85 

Class D shares 

0.25 

Class I shares 

Subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation, we will pay a shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee equal to 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV for the Class S shares, a shareholder servicing fee equal to 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV for the Class D shares, in each case, payable monthly. 
 The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid monthly in arrears. The Managing Dealer will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding us, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Managing Dealer will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase.

Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends or distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends or distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Upon a suspension of our share repurchase program, our Board will consider at least quarterly whether the continued suspension of our share repurchase program remains in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. However, our Board is not required to authorize the recommencement of our share repurchase program within any specified period of time. Our Board may also determine to terminate our share repurchase program if required by applicable law or in connection with a transaction in which our shareholders receive liquidity for their Common Shares, such as a sale or merger of the Fund or listing of our Common Shares on a national securities exchange. 
 We expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers each quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at our discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. We intend to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Proxy Voting Policy and Proxy Voting Record 
 The Fund has delegated to the Adviser the authority to vote the Fund s proxies in accordance with the Adviser s established formal written proxy voting guidelines Guidelines ). The Guidelines are designed to ensure that proxies cast on behalf of the Fund are voted in a manner consistent with the best interests of Members. The Adviser has also adopted the Guidelines as part of its proxy voting policies and procedures in accordance with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act pursuant to which the Adviser has a duty to monitor corporate events and to vote proxies, as well as a duty to cast votes in the best interests of clients and not subrogate client interests to its own interests. The Guidelines are reviewed at least annually by the Adviser, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 In evaluating proxies, the Adviser considers factors that are financially material to individual companies and investing funds investment objectives and strategies in support of maximizing long-term Member value. This includes considering the company s approach to financial and operational, human, and natural capital and the impact of that approach on the potential future value of the business. The Adviser will vote on proposals not specifically addressed by the Guidelines based on an evaluation of a proposal s likelihood to enhance the long-term economic returns or profitability of the Fund or to maximize long-term Member value. 
 In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and in limited circumstances, the Adviser may determine not to vote proxies where certain restrictions apply. In accordance with the Guidelines, voting of proxies is conducted in a manner consistent with the Adviser s fiduciary obligations to the Fund, and all applicable laws and regulations. In other words, the Adviser votes in a manner consistent with the Guidelines and in the best interests of the Fund s Members, and without regard to any other Fidelity companies business relationships. The Adviser takes its responsibility to vote proxies in the best interests of the Fund s Members seriously and has implemented policies and procedures to address actual and potential conflicts of interest.

 Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and the purchase, ownership and disposition of our shares. This discussion does not purport to be complete or to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to shareholders in light of their particular circumstances. Unless otherwise noted, this discussion applies only to U.S. shareholders that hold our shares as capital assets. A U.S. shareholder is an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. corporation, a trust if it (a) is subject to the primary supervision of a court in the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person, or any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source. This discussion is based upon present provisions of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative ruling authorities, all of which are subject to change, or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion does not represent a detailed description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to special classes of taxpayers including, without limitation, financial institutions, insurance companies, investors in pass-through entities, U.S. shareholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities or commodities that elect mark to market treatment, or persons that will hold our shares as a position in a straddle, hedge or as part of a constructive sale for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, this discussion does not address the application of the Medicare tax on net investment income or the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, or any tax consequences attributable to persons being required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to our shares as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers with regard to the U.S. federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of our shares, as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, foreign country or other taxing jurisdiction. 
 Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
 The Fund intends to elect to be treated, and intends to qualify each taxable year, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 To qualify for the favorable tax treatment accorded to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code, the Fund must, among other things: (1) have an election in effect to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; (2) have filed with its return for the taxable year an election to be a RIC or have made such election for a previous taxable year; (3) derive in each taxable year at least 90 of its gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies; and (b) net income derived from an interest in certain publicly-traded partnerships that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that derive less than 90 of their gross income from the items described in (a) above (each, a Qualified Publicly Traded Partnership and (4) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year of the Fund (a) at least 50 of the value of the Fund s total assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs, and other securities for purposes of this calculation limited, in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 of the value of the Fund s total assets, and to not more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25 of the value of the Fund s total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of (I) any one issuer, (II) any two or more issuers which the Fund controls and which are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses or (III) any one or more Qualified Publicly Traded Partnerships (described in 3(b) above). 
 As a RIC, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in the Code, but determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes in each taxable year to its shareholders, provided that it distributes at least 90 of the sum of its investment company taxable income and its net tax-exempt income for such taxable year. Generally, the Fund intends to distribute to its shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gains, if any. 
 26 

Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax. To prevent imposition of the excise tax, the Fund must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98 of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2 of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. For these purposes, the Fund will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which it paid U.S. federal income tax. 
 A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of any calendar year if it is declared by the Fund in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year. Such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received. 
 If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC or failed to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Fund would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on its taxable income (including distributions of net capital gain), even if such income were distributed to its shareholders, and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxed to shareholders as ordinary dividend income. Such distributions generally would be eligible (i) to be treated as qualified dividend income in the case of individual and other non-corporate shareholders and (ii) for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders. In addition, the Fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for taxation as a RIC. 
 The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Fund qualifies as a RIC for each taxable year. 

The Adviser will select investments for the Fund in part on the basis of publicly available information filed with various government regulators or information made directly available to the Adviser. Although the Adviser will evaluate all such information and data and seek independent corroboration when it considers it appropriate and reasonably available, the Adviser may not be in a position to confirm the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of such information and data. The Adviser is dependent upon the integrity of the management of the entities filing such information and of such companies and third parties providing such information, as well as the financial reporting process in general. The value of an investment made by the Fund may be affected by fraud, misrepresentation or omission on the part of a company or any related parties to such company, or by other parties to the investment (or any related collateral and security arrangements). Such fraud, misrepresentation or omission may adversely affect the value of the investment and/or the value of the collateral underlying the investment in question and may adversely affect the Fund s ability to enforce its contractual rights relating to that investment or the relevant obligor s ability to repay the principal or interest on the investment. In addition, the Adviser may rely upon independent consultants or experts in connection with its evaluation of proposed investments. There can be no assurance that these consultants or experts will accurately evaluate such investments. Investment analyses and decisions by the Adviser may be undertaken on an expedited basis in order to make it possible for the Fund to take advantage of short-lived investment opportunities. In such cases, the available information at the time of an investment decision may be limited, inaccurate and/or incomplete. In addition, the financial information available to the Adviser may not be accurate or provided based upon accepted accounting methods. Accordingly, the Adviser cannot guarantee that the due diligence investigation it carries out with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity which may have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Fund. 

omissions, imperfections and malfunctions, including those caused by computer worms, viruses and power failures. Failures in the systems employed by the Adviser, administrators, custodians, counterparties, exchanges and similar clearance and settlement facilities and other parties could result in mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions, or in transactions not being properly booked, evaluated or accounted for. Disruptions in the Fund s operations or breach of the Fund s information systems may cause the Fund to suffer, among other things, financial loss, the disruption of its business, liability to third parties, regulatory penalties or reputational damage. Any of the foregoing failures or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the Fund and the shareholders investment therein. 

Issuer/Borrower Fraud . Of paramount concern in originating loans is the possibility of material misrepresentation or omission on the part of borrowers or guarantors. Such inaccuracy or incompleteness may adversely affect the valuation of the collateral underlying the loans or may adversely affect the ability of the Fund or its affiliates to perfect or effectuate a lien on the collateral securing the loan. The Fund or its affiliates will rely upon the accuracy and completeness of representations made by borrowers to the extent reasonable but cannot guarantee such accuracy or completeness. 

 Reliance on Company Management . The Adviser generally will seek to monitor the performance of investments in operating companies either through interaction with the board of the applicable company and/or by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with the company s management team. However, the Fund generally will not be in a position to control any borrower by virtue of investing in its debt and the portfolio company s management will be primarily responsible for the operations of the company on a day-to-day basis. Although it is the intent of the Fund to invest in companies with strong management teams, there can be no assurance that the existing management team, or any new one, will be able to operate the company successfully. In addition, the Fund is subject to the risk that a borrower in which it invests may make business decisions with which the Fund disagrees and the management of such borrower, as representatives of the common equity holders, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve the interests of the debt investors, including the Fund. Furthermore, in exercising its investment discretion, the Adviser may in certain circumstances commit funds of the Fund to other entities that will be given a mandate to make certain investments consistent with the Fund s investment objectives and that may earn a performance-based fee on those investments. Once such a commitment is made, such entities will have full control over the investment of such funds, and the Adviser will cease to have such control. 

 Environmental Matters . Ordinary operation or the occurrence of an accident with respect to the portfolio companies in which the Fund invest could cause major environmental damage, which may result in significant financial distress to the Fund s investments and any portfolio company holding such assets, even if covered by insurance. Certain environmental laws and regulations may require that an owner or operator of an asset address prior environmental contamination, which could involve substantial cost and other liabilities. The Fund (and the Fund investors) may therefore be exposed to substantial risk of loss from environmental claims arising in respect of its investments. Furthermore, changes in environmental laws or regulations or the environmental condition of an investment may create liabilities that did not exist at the time of its acquisition and that could not have been foreseen. Even in cases where the Fund is indemnified by the seller with respect to an investment against liabilities arising out of violations of environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance as to the financial viability of the seller to satisfy such indemnities or the ability of the Fund to achieve enforcement of such indemnities. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Provision of Managerial Assistance; Control Person Liability below. 

 No Readily Determinable Valuation . The Fund expects that many of its portfolio investments will take the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of loans, securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable and will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, including to reflect significant events affecting the value of the Fund s investments. Most, if not all, of the Fund s investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) will be classified as Level 3 assets under Topic 820 of the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification, as amended, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. This means that the Fund s portfolio valuations will be based on unobservable inputs and the Fund s assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. The Fund expects that inputs into the determination of fair value of portfolio investments will require significant management judgment or estimation. Factors used in determining fair value vary by investment type and may include market or investment specific events, transaction data, estimated cash flows, and market observations of comparable investments. In determining fair value of the Fund s loan investments the types of factors that the fair value committee (the Fair Value Committee may take into account generally include comparison to publicly-traded securities including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these loans and securities existed. The Fund engages one or more independent valuation firms to prepare month-end valuation recommendations for investments for which market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each month. The independent valuation firm undertakes a full analysis of the investments and provides estimated fair values for such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firm also provides analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Adviser s Fair Value Committee reviews and approves each valuation recommendation and confirms it has been calculated in accordance with the Board-approved policies and procedures. The Fund s NAV could be adversely affected if determinations regarding the fair value of the Fund s investments were materially higher than the values that the Fund ultimately realizes upon the disposal of such loans and securities. In addition, the method of calculating the Advisory Fee may result in conflicts of interest between the Adviser, on the one hand, and investors on the other hand, with respect to the valuation of investments. 

 Follow-On Investments in Portfolio Companies . Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, the Fund may make additional investments in that portfolio company as follow-on investments, in order to: 

 increase or maintain in whole or in part the Fund s equity ownership percentage; 

 exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; 

 attempt to preserve or enhance the value of the Fund s investment; or 

 invest in various growth or merger and acquisition related initiatives. 

 The Fund may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. The Fund has the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and the Fund s initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for the Fund to increase its participation in a successful operation. Even if the Fund has sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, it may elect not to make a follow-on investment because it may not want to increase its concentration of risk, because it prefers other opportunities or because it is inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements or compliance with the requirements for maintenance of its RIC status. Equity Interests in Portfolio Companies . The Fund does not generally intend to take controlling equity positions in the Fund s portfolio companies. To the extent that the Fund does not hold a controlling equity interest in a portfolio company, it will be subject to the risk that such portfolio company may make business decisions with which the Fund disagrees, and the stockholders and management of such portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to the Fund s interests. Due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that the Fund typically holds in portfolio companies, the Fund may not be able to dispose of its investments in the event it disagrees with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of its investments. 

 Defaults by Portfolio Companies . A portfolio company s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by the Fund or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the loans are due and foreclosure on the portfolio company s assets representing collateral for its obligations. This could trigger cross defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company s ability to meet its obligations under the debt that the Fund holds and the value of any equity securities the Fund owns. The Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. 

 Third Party Litigation . The Fund s investment activities subject it to the normal risks of becoming involved in litigation initiated by third parties. This risk is somewhat greater where the Fund exercises control or influence over a company s direction. The expense of defending against claims by third parties and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, absent willful misconduct or gross negligence by the Adviser, be borne by the Fund (to the extent not borne by the portfolio companies) and would reduce net assets or could require Fund investors to return to the Fund distributed capital and earnings. The Adviser and others are indemnified in connection with such litigation, subject to certain conditions. 

 Nature of Investments Risk. The Adviser will have broad discretion in making investments for the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Adviser will correctly evaluate the nature or magnitude of the various factors that could affect the value of and return on the Fund s investments. Prices of investments may be volatile, and a variety of factors that are inherently difficult to predict, such as domestic or international economic and political developments, may significantly affect the results of the Fund s activities and the value of its investments. These factors and others may significantly affect the results of the Fund s activities and the value of its investments. 

 An investment in the Fund is suitable only for those investors willing to risk losing some or all of their principal investment and who have the experience and ability to evaluate the risks and merits of an investment in the Fund. Potential investors should consult with their investment advisers, attorneys and accountants prior to investing in the Fund. The following is a description of certain factors which, along with the information discussed in this Form 10-K and such other matters as may be material to an investment in the Fund, should be considered by prospective investors in the Fund. 

The risks of foreign investing may be magnified for investments in emerging markets. Security prices in emerging markets can be significantly more volatile than those in more developed markets, reflecting the greater uncertainties of investing in less established markets and economies. In particular, countries with emerging markets may have relatively unstable governments, may present the risks of nationalization of businesses, restrictions on foreign ownership and prohibitions on the repatriation of assets, and may have less protection of property rights than more developed countries. The economies of countries with emerging markets may be based on only a few industries, may be highly vulnerable to changes in local or global trade conditions, and may suffer from extreme and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates. Local securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. 

In addition, a decline in the credit quality of loans in a CLO due to poor operating results of the relevant borrower, declines in the value of loan collateral or increases in defaults, among other things, may force a CLO to sell certain assets at a loss, reducing their earnings and, in turn, cash potentially available for distribution to us for distribution to shareholders. To the extent that any losses are incurred by the CLO in respect of any collateral, such losses will be borne first by us as owner of equity interests in the CLO. The collateral manager for a CLO that we create may be the Fund, the Adviser or an affiliate, and such collateral manager may be entitled to receive compensation for structuring and/or management services. To the extent the Adviser or an affiliate other than the Fund serves as collateral manager and the Fund is obligated to compensate the Adviser or the affiliate for such services, we, the Adviser or the affiliate will implement offsetting arrangements to assure that we, and indirectly, our shareholders, pay no additional fees to the Adviser or the affiliate in connection therewith. To the extent the Fund serves as collateral manager, the Fund will receive no fees for providing such collateral management services. 

Documentation Risks . Many derivative instruments also have documentation risk. Because the contract for each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated, the counterparty may interpret contractual terms e.g. , the definition of default) differently than the Fund, and if it does, the Fund may decide not to pursue its claims against the counterparty to avoid incurring the cost and unpredictability of legal proceedings. The Fund, therefore, may be unable to obtain payments the Adviser believes are owed to the Fund under derivative instruments or those payments may be delayed or made only after the Fund has incurred the costs of litigation. 

 Liquidity Risks . If a derivative transaction is particularly large or if the relevant market is illiquid (as is the case with many OTC derivatives), it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous price. Less liquid derivative instruments also may fall more in price than other securities during market falls. During periods of market disruptions, the Fund may have a greater need for cash to provide collateral for large swings in the mark-to-market obligations arising under the derivative instruments used by the Fund. These risks may be further exacerbated by requirements under rules issued pursuant to recently enacted financial reform legislation. 

 Leverage Risks . Because many derivatives have a leverage component i.e. , a notional value in excess of the assets needed to establish or maintain the derivative position), adverse changes in the value or level of the underlying asset, rate or index can result in a loss substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative itself. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. 

 Tax Uncertainties . The taxation of derivatives, including credit default swaps and other transactions in which the Fund may participate, is subject to uncertainties. Such transactions may become subject to new laws and regulations, possibly with retroactive effect, as well as differing interpretations of existing law and regulations by the relevant taxing authorities. There can be no assurance that such changes in law or interpretation will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund. 

 Other Risks . Other risks in using derivatives include the risk of mispricing or incorrect valuation of derivatives. Many derivatives, in particular OTC derivatives, are complex and their valuation often requires modeling and judgment, which increases the risk of mispricing or incorrect valuation. The pricing models used may not produce valuations that are consistent with the values the Fund realizes when it closes or sells an OTC derivative. Valuation risk is more pronounced when the Fund enters into OTC derivatives with specialized terms because the market value of those derivatives in some cases is determined in part by reference to similar derivatives with more standardized terms. Incorrect valuations may result in increased cash payment requirements to counterparties, over- and/or under- collateralization, and/or errors in calculation of the Fund s NAV. 

 The Fund s use of derivatives may not be effective or have the desired result. Derivatives involve the risk that changes in their value may not move as expected relative to the value of the assets, rates or indices they are designed to track. The risk may be more pronounced when outstanding notional amounts in the market exceed the amounts of the referenced assets. For example, the Fund s use of reverse repurchase agreements subjects it to interest costs based on the difference between the sale and repurchase price of the securities involved. Derivatives are also subject to currency and other risks. Moreover, suitable derivatives may not be available in all circumstances. For example, the economic costs of taking some derivatives positions may be prohibitive. In addition, the Adviser may decide not to use derivatives to hedge or otherwise reduce the Fund s risk exposures, potentially resulting in losses for the Fund. Counterparties to derivatives contracts may have the right to terminate such contracts if the Fund s NAV declines below a certain level over a specified period of time. The exercise of such a right by the counterparty could have a material adverse effect on the Fund s operations. In late October 2020, the SEC adopted Rule 18f-4 related to the use of derivatives and certain other transactions that rescinded and withdrew the guidance of the SEC and the SEC staff regarding asset segregation and coverage. Under Rule 18f-4, the Fund must trade derivatives and other transactions that potentially create senior securities (except reverse repurchase agreements) subject to a value-at-risk ("VaR") leverage limit, certain other testing and derivatives risk management program requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the Fund qualifies as a limited derivatives user as defined in Rule 18f-4. Reverse repurchase agreements need to aggregate the amount of indebtedness associated with the reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions with the aggregate amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness when calculating the asset coverage ratio (unless the Fund determines to treat such agreements and transactions as derivatives for all purposes under the rule). Reverse repurchase agreements are not included in the calculation of whether the Fund is a limited derivatives user (unless the Fund determines to treat such agreements and transactions as derivatives for all purposes under the rule), but if the Fund is subject to the VaR testing, reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions are included for purposes of such testing. These requirements may limit the Fund s ability to use derivatives and reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions as part of the Fund s investment strategies. These requirements may increase the cost of the Fund s investments and cost of doing business, which could adversely affect investors. 

The Fund may make unsecured loans, meaning that such loans will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on an investment s collateral, if any, will secure the investment s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the investment under its secured loan agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before the Fund. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The Fund can offer no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the Fund s unsecured loan obligations after payment in full of all loans secured by collateral. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured loan obligations, then the Fund s unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors claims against the investment s remaining assets, if any. The rights the Fund may have with respect to the collateral securing any junior priority loans, including any last out pieces of tranched first lien loans, the Fund makes to the Fund s investments may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that the Fund enters into (or the absence of an intercreditor agreement) with the holders of senior debt. Under a typical intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; 

 the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; 

 the approval of amendments to collateral documents; 

 releases of liens on the collateral; and 

 waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. 

 The Fund may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if the Fund s rights as junior lenders are adversely affected. 

In addition, it is possible a court may invalidate, in whole or in part, the indebtedness underlying an investment of the Fund as a fraudulent conveyance, subordinate such indebtedness to existing or future creditors of the obligor or recover amounts previously paid by the obligor in satisfaction of such indebtedness. Moreover, in the event of the insolvency of an issuer of a portfolio company, payments made on its indebtedness could be subject to avoidance as a preference if made within a certain period of time (which may be as long as one year) before the portfolio company becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Even if the Fund does not engage in conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon fraudulent conveyance or preference law, there can be no assurance as to whether any lending institution or other party from which the Fund may acquire such indebtedness, or any prior holder of such indebtedness, has not engaged in any such conduct (or any other conduct that would subject such indebtedness to disallowance or subordination under insolvency laws) and, if it did engage in such conduct, as to whether such creditor claims could be asserted in a U.S. court (or in the courts of any other country) against the Fund so that the Fund s claim against the issuer would be disallowed or subordinated.

As a result of the foregoing, the Adviser, its affiliates and their principals and employees may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and activity between the Fund and Other Clients, in allocating investments among the Fund and Other Clients and in effecting transactions between the Fund and Other Clients, including ones in which the Adviser, its affiliates and their principals and employees may have a greater financial interest. In addition, the Adviser, its affiliates and their principals and employees, including employees of the Adviser, may make personal investments in third-party entities (directly or through investment funds managed by third-party managers). Such entities may enter into transactions with the Fund, presenting a conflict of interest for the Adviser between acting in the best interests of the Fund and enhancing the returns of such personal investments. Co-Investment Transactions. We and the Adviser have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliated accounts managed and controlled by the Adviser and/or its affiliates. Subject to the 1940 Act and the conditions of the co-investment order issued by the SEC, the Fund may, under certain circumstances, co-invest with certain affiliated accounts in investments that are suitable for the Fund and one or more of such affiliated accounts. Even though the Fund and any such affiliated account co-invest in the same securities, conflicts of interest may still arise. If the Adviser is presented with co-investment opportunities that generally fall within the Fund s investment objective and other Board-Established Criteria and those of one or more affiliated accounts advised by the Adviser and/or its affiliates, whether focused on a debt strategy or otherwise, the Adviser and/or its affiliates will allocate such opportunities among the Fund and such affiliated accounts in a manner consistent with the exemptive order and the applicable allocation policies and procedures. With respect to co-investment transactions conducted under the exemptive order, initial internal allocations among the Fund and other investment funds affiliated with the Adviser will generally be made, taking into account the allocation considerations set forth in the Adviser s allocation policies and procedures as described above. If the Fund invests in a transaction under the co-investment exemptive order and, immediately before the submission of the order for the Fund and all other funds, accounts, or other similar arrangements advised by the Adviser and its affiliates, the opportunity is oversubscribed, it will generally be allocated on a pro-rata basis based on internal order size. The Fund may only be able to participate in certain negotiated investment opportunities on a rotational basis due to the limitations and requirements imposed by the order. To the extent consistent with applicable law and/or exemptive relief issued to the Fund, in addition to such co-investments, the Fund and the Adviser or an affiliated account may, as part of unrelated transactions, invest in either the same or different tiers of a portfolio company s capital structure or in an affiliate of such portfolio company. To the extent the Fund holds investments in the same portfolio company or in an affiliate thereof that are different (including with respect to their relative seniority) than those held by the Adviser or an affiliated account, the Adviser may be presented with decisions when the interests of the two co-investors are in conflict. If the portfolio company in which the Fund has an equity or debt investment and in which an affiliated account has an equity or debt investment elsewhere in the portfolio company s capital structure, becomes distressed or defaults on its obligations under the private credit investment, the Adviser may have conflicting loyalties between its duties to the affiliated account, the Fund, certain of its other affiliates and the portfolio company. In that regard, actions may be taken for such affiliated account that are adverse to the Fund, or actions may or may not be taken by the Fund due to such affiliated account s investment, which action or failure to act may be adverse to the Fund. In addition, it is possible that in a bankruptcy proceeding, the Fund s interest may be adversely affected by virtue of such affiliated account s involvement and actions relating to its investment. Decisions about what action should be taken in a troubled situation, including whether to enforce claims, whether to advocate or initiate restructuring or liquidation inside or outside of bankruptcy and the terms of any work-out or restructuring, raise conflicts of interest. In those circumstances where the Fund and such affiliated accounts hold investments in different classes of a company s debt or equity, the Adviser may also, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, take steps to reduce the potential for adversity between the Fund and such affiliated accounts, including causing the Fund to take certain actions that, in the absence of such conflict, it would not take, such as (A) remaining passive in a restructuring or similar situations (including electing not to vote or voting pro rata with other security-holders), (B) divesting investments or (C) otherwise taking action designed to reduce adversity. Performance Based Compensation and Management Fees . The existence of the incentive fees payable to the Adviser may create a greater incentive for the Adviser to make more speculative investments on behalf of the Fund, or to time the purchase or sale of investments in a manner motivated by the personal interests of the Adviser, its affiliates and/or their personnel. The manner in which the Adviser s entitlement to incentive fees is determined may result in a conflict between its interests and the interests of shareholders with respect to the sequence and timing of disposals of investments, as the Adviser may want to dispose of lower yielding investments in favor of higher yielding ones. Transaction Fees and Other Fees. In connection with investments made by us, the Adviser and its affiliates may negotiate and receive origination, commitment, documentation, structuring, facility, monitoring, amendment, refinancing, and/or other fees from portfolio investments in which we invest or propose to invest. The Adviser and its affiliates will only retain transaction and other fees if permissible under the 1940 Act, SEC exemptive relief, and other applicable law. Under the terms of our co-investment relief, transaction fees (except for fees contemplated by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act) received in connection with a co-investment transaction are distributed pro rata to funds that participate in such transaction. The potential for the Adviser and its affiliates to receive economic benefits creates conflicts of interest as the Adviser and its affiliates would have an incentive to invest in portfolio investments that provide such benefits. Similarly, the Adviser and its affiliates could be incentivized to waive certain fees in connection with a refinancing in order to receive certain fees in the new transaction, including when we and/or other accounts advised by the Adviser and its affiliates can participate in the original or refinanced investment, or both. Broken Deal Expenses . Any expenses that may be incurred by the Fund for actual investments as described herein may also be incurred by the Fund with respect to broken deals i.e ., investments that are not consummated). The Adviser is not required to and in most circumstances will not seek reimbursement of broken deal expenses i.e ., expenses incurred in pursuit of an investment that is not consummated) from third parties, including counterparties to the potential transaction or potential co-investors. Examples of such broken deal expenses include, but are not limited to, reverse termination fees, extraordinary expenses such as litigation costs and judgments, travel and entertainment expenses incurred, costs of negotiating co-investment documentation, and legal, accounting, tax and other due diligence and pursuit costs and expenses. Any such broken deal expenses could, in the sole discretion of the Adviser, be allocated solely to the Fund and not to Other Clients or co-investment vehicles that could have made the investment, even when the Other Client or co-investment vehicle commonly invests alongside the Fund in its investments or the Adviser or Other Clients in their investments. In such cases, the Fund s shares of expenses would increase. In the event broken deal expenses are allocated to an Other Client or a co-investment vehicle, the Adviser may advance such fees and expenses without charging interest until paid by the Other Client or co-investment vehicle, as applicable. Policies and Procedures of the Adviser and its Affiliates. Because the Adviser and its affiliates have many different asset management and advisory businesses, the Adviser may be subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest, greater regulatory oversight and more legal and contractual restrictions than that to which it would be subject if it had just one line of business. Certain policies and procedures implemented by the Adviser and its affiliates to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory requirements and contractual restrictions will from time to time impact the Fund. For example, the Adviser will come into possession of material non-public information with respect to companies, including companies in which the Fund has investments or is considering making investments. The information, which could be of benefit to the Fund, is likely to be restricted to those other businesses and otherwise be unavailable to the Fund. It is also possible that the Fund could be restricted from trading despite the fact that the Fund did not receive such information. The inability to buy or sell securities in such circumstances could materially adversely affect the investment results of the Fund, including but not limited to a material loss with respect to an individual investment or differing results than those obtained by Other Clients with respect to the same investment. Additionally, the Adviser may restrict or otherwise limit the Fund and/or its portfolio companies from entering into agreements with, or related to, companies that either are advisory clients of the Adviser and its affiliates or in which any fund of the Adviser or its affiliates have invested or has considered making an investment. The Adviser will from time to time restrict or otherwise limit the ability of the Fund and/or its portfolio companies from making investments in or otherwise engaging in businesses or activities competitive with companies of other advisory clients of the Adviser or its affiliates, either as a result of contractual restrictions or otherwise. Furthermore, there will be circumstances in which affiliates of the Adviser and its affiliates (including Other Clients) may refrain from taking certain confidential information in order to avoid trading restrictions. There can be no assurance that additional restrictions will not be imposed that would further limit the ability of the Adviser and its affiliates to share information internally. Declining an Investment. The Adviser may decline an investment opportunity on behalf of the Fund based on various factors including its investment allocation policies and procedures and to the extent the Adviser determines, in its discretion, that such investment may (a) have reputational considerations for the Fund investors, the Adviser or the Fund, (b) to the Adviser s knowledge, have been the subject of concern or controversy among financial institutions, institutional investors or the public or (c) give rise to other similar considerations. In certain cases, such an investment may be allocated to other affiliated accounts that have consented to the investment or do not, in the Adviser s discretion, have such considerations, in lieu of the investment being allocated to the Fund. Finally, although Fidelity believes its positive reputation in the marketplace provides benefit to the Fund and Other Clients, the Adviser could decline to undertake investment activity or transact with a counterparty on behalf of the Fund for reputational reasons, and this decision could result in the Fund foregoing a profit or suffering a loss. Conflicts of Interest Generally. If any matter arises that the Adviser, as applicable, determines in its good faith judgment constitutes an actual conflict of interest, the Adviser, as applicable, will take such actions as it determines in good faith may be necessary or appropriate to ameliorate the conflict. (These actions include, by way of example and without limitation, (i) disposing of the investment or refraining from making the investment giving rise to the conflict of interest; (ii) appointing an independent fiduciary to act with respect to the matter giving rise to the conflict of interest; (iii) in connection with a matter giving rise to a conflict of interest with respect to an investment, consulting with the Board regarding the conflict of interest and/or obtaining a waiver or consent from the Board of the conflict of interest or acting in a manner, or pursuant to standards or procedures, approved by or disclosed to the Board with respect to such conflict of interest; (iv) disclosing the conflict to the Fund investors; (v) implementing certain policies and procedures designed to ameliorate such conflict of interest or (vi) remaining passive and/or electing not to be the lead investor of a tranche of securities (even though the Fund may hold the largest stake in the applicable tranche of securities).) There can be no assurance that the Adviser will identify or resolve all conflicts of interest in a manner that is favorable to the Fund. By acquiring Common Shares in the Fund, each Fund investor will be deemed to have acknowledged and consented to the existence or resolution of any such actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence of any such conflict of interest. For the avoidance of doubt, in some cases after evaluating such conflict or potential conflict, the Adviser may determine that no action is required or that taking action may be adverse to the interests of the Fund, the Adviser or its affiliates. Diverse Membership; Relationships with Fund Investors. The Fund and investors are generally expected to have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to the investments made by the Fund. The Fund investors may include various types of persons or entities organized in various jurisdictions, and different Fund investors may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests in respect of their investment in the Fund. The conflicting interests of the Fund and of individual Fund investors may relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Fund, the structuring of the acquisition of the Fund s investments, and the timing of disposition of investments, which may be more beneficial for the Fund or Fund investors than for one or more of the other Fund investors. Such structuring of the Fund s investments and other factors may result in different returns being realized by different Fund investors. Furthermore, under the U.S. tax audit rules applicable to the Fund, decisions or elections made in connection with certain laws and regulations by the Adviser (or such other person designated by the Adviser) in connection with tax audits (including whether or not to make an election under those rules) may be more beneficial for one type of Fund investor than for another type of Fund investor. As a consequence, conflicts of interest among different Fund investors may arise in connection with decisions made by the Adviser, including in respect of the nature or structuring of investments and the use of leverage that may be more beneficial for one Fund investor than for another Fund investor, especially in respect of individual tax situations. In addition, the Fund may face certain tax risks based on positions taken by the Fund, the Adviser on behalf of the Fund, the Fund s subsidiaries and/or a withholding agent. Allocation of Personnel . The Adviser and its members, officers, personnel and employees will devote as much of their time to the activities of the Fund as they deem necessary to conduct its business affairs in an appropriate manner. By the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is not restricted from forming additional investment funds, from entering into other investment advisory relationships or from engaging in other business activities, even though such activities may be in competition with the Fund and/or may involve substantial time and resources of the Adviser. Personnel of the Adviser and its affiliates, including members of the Direct Lending Investment Committee, will work on other projects, serve on other committees and source potential investments for and otherwise assist the investment programs of Other Clients and their portfolio companies, including other investment programs to be developed in the future. These activities could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest in that the time and effort of the members of the Adviser and its officers, personnel and employees will not be devoted exclusively to the business of the Fund but will be allocated between the business of the Fund and the management of the monies of such other advisees of the Adviser. Time spent on these other initiatives diverts attention from the activities of the Fund, which could negatively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Furthermore, personnel of the Adviser and its affiliates derive financial benefit from these other activities, including fees and performance-based compensation. Fidelity personnel outside of the Adviser may share in the fees and performance-based compensation from the Fund; similarly, personnel of the Adviser and its affiliates may share in the fees and performance-based compensation generated by Other Clients. These and other factors create conflicts of interest in the allocation of time by personnel of the Adviser and its affiliates. The determination of the Adviser and its affiliates of the amount of time necessary to conduct the Fund s activities will be conclusive, and shareholders rely on the Adviser s judgment in this regard. The officers and trustees will devote such portion of their time to our affairs as is required for the performance of their duties, but they are not required to devote all of their time to us. Outside Activities of Principals and Other Personnel and their Related Parties . Certain of the principals, personnel and employees of the Adviser may be subject to a variety of conflicts of interest relating to their responsibilities to the Fund, Other Clients and their respective portfolio companies, and their outside business activities as members of investment or advisory committees or boards of directors of or advisors to investment funds, corporations, foundations or other organizations. Such positions create a conflict if such other entities have interests that are adverse to those of the Fund, including if such other entities compete with the Fund for investment opportunities or other resources. The other managed accounts and/or investment funds in which such individuals may become involved may have investment objectives that overlap with the Fund. Furthermore, certain principals and employees of the Adviser may have a greater financial interest in the performance of such other funds or accounts than the performance of the Fund. Such involvement may create conflicts of interest in making investments on behalf of the Fund and such other funds and accounts. Although such principals and employees will seek to limit any such conflicts in a manner that is in accordance with their fiduciary duties to the Fund, there can be no assurance they will be resolved favorably for the Fund. Also, Fidelity personnel and employees, including, personnel and employees of the Adviser, are generally permitted to invest in alternative investment funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, hedge funds or other investment vehicles, including potential competitors of the Fund. Shareholders will not receive any benefit from any such investments, and the financial incentives of such Fidelity employees in such other investments could be greater than their financial incentives in relation to the Fund. Additionally, certain employees and other professionals of Fidelity have family members or relatives employed by such advisers and service providers (or their affiliates) or otherwise actively involved in industries and sectors in which the Fund invests, or have business, financial, personal or other relationships with companies in such industries and sectors (including the advisors and service providers described above) or other industries, which gives rise to potential or actual conflicts of interest. For example, such family members or relatives might be employees, officers, directors or owners of companies or assets that are actual or potential investments of the Fund or other counterparties of the Fund and its portfolio companies and/or assets. Moreover, in certain instances, the Fund or its portfolio companies may issue loans to or acquire securities from, or otherwise transact with, companies that are owned by such family members or relatives or in respect of which such family members or relatives have other involvement. These relationships may influence the Adviser in deciding whether to select or recommend such service providers to perform services for the Fund or portfolio companies (the cost of which will generally be borne directly or indirectly by the Fund or such portfolio companies, as applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the Adviser determines appropriate, conflict mitigation strategies may be put in place with respect to a particular circumstance, such as internal information barriers or recusal, disclosure or other steps determined appropriate by the Adviser. The shareholders rely on the Adviser to manage these conflicts in its sole discretion. Valuation of Assets . A majority of securities and other assets in which the Fund will directly or indirectly invest, including secured loan investments, are not expected to have a readily ascertainable market value and will be valued by the Adviser in accordance with its established valuation policies. Such securities and other assets will constitute a substantial portion of the Fund s investments. In addition, when the Adviser determines that the market price does not fairly represent the value of an investment, the Adviser will fair value such investment in accordance with the Fund s policies and procedures. The Adviser has a conflict of interest in determining such valuations, as the Adviser s determination of a fair value for such investments may cause it to receive a higher Advisory Fee. The Adviser and its affiliates are engaged in advisory and management services for multiple collective investment vehicles and managed accounts, including other investment funds managed by the Adviser and its affiliates. In connection with these activities, the Adviser and its affiliates are required to value assets, including in connection with managing or advising their proprietary and client accounts. In this regard, the Adviser and its affiliates may share information regarding valuation techniques and models or other information relevant to the valuation of a specific asset or category of assets, although they are under no obligation to engage in such information sharing. Conflicts with Portfolio Companies. In certain instances, the portfolio managers and officers, personnel and employees of the Adviser may serve as board members of certain portfolio companies and, in that capacity, will be required to make decisions that they consider to be in the best interests of the portfolio company. In certain circumstances, such as in situations involving bankruptcy or near insolvency of the portfolio company, actions that may be in the best interests of the portfolio company may not be in the best interests of the Fund, and vice versa. Accordingly, in these situations, there may be conflicts of interest between an individual s duties as a portfolio manager or officer or employee of the Adviser and such individual s duties as a board member of the portfolio company. Additionally, the Adviser or affiliates of the Adviser may enter into transactions with a portfolio company (for example, a property lease), which may create a conflict of interest. While it is generally expected that any such transaction would be on arm s length terms, it is possible that the portfolio company may pay higher fees or receive fewer benefits in the transaction than it would if the counterparty to the transaction were a third party. Selection of Service Providers. The Fund s advisers and Service Providers or their affiliates are expected to provide goods or services to, or have business, personal, financial or other relations with the Adviser, its affiliates, advisory clients and portfolio companies. Such advisers and Service Providers may be investors in the Fund, sources of investment opportunities or co-investors or commercial counterparties or entities in which the Adviser or an affiliate has an investment. Additionally, certain employees of the Adviser or its affiliates may have family members or relatives employed by such advisers and Service Providers. These relationships may influence the Adviser in deciding whether to select or recommend such Service Providers to perform services for the Fund or portfolio companies (the cost of which generally will be borne directly or indirectly by the Fund or such entities, as applicable). Additionally, affiliates of the Fund s adviser are acting and expected to continue to act in the future as the administrative agent on a number of loans in which the Fund invested or may invest in the future, which may contemplate additional compensation to such affiliates for the service of acting as administrative agent thereunder. The Adviser and its affiliates will only retain compensation as administrative agent if permissible under the 1940 Act, SEC exemptive relief, and other applicable law. Under the documentation for such loans, an entity typically is designated as the administrative agent and/or collateral agent, and this agent is granted a lien on any collateral on behalf of the other lenders and distributes payments on the indebtedness as they are received. As is typical in such agency arrangements, the agent is the party responsible for administering and enforcing the terms of the loan facility, may take certain actions and make certain decisions in its discretion and generally may take material actions only in accordance with the instructions of a designated percentage of the lenders. Data . The Adviser and its affiliates receive or obtains various kinds of data and information from the Fund, Other Clients and their portfolio companies, including data and information relating to business operations, trends, budgets, customers and other metrics, some of which is sometimes referred to as big data. The Adviser can be expected to be better able to anticipate macroeconomic and other trends, and otherwise develop investment themes, as a result of its access to (and rights regarding) this data and information from the Fund, Other Clients and their portfolio companies. In light of its relationship with the Fund, Other Clients and their portfolio companies, related parties and service providers, the Adviser may have access to (and rights regarding) data that it would not otherwise obtain in the ordinary course. Although the Adviser believes that these activities improve the Adviser s investment management activities on behalf of the Fund and Other Clients, information obtained from the Fund and its portfolio companies may provide material benefits to the Adviser and its affiliates or Other Clients without compensation or other benefit accruing to the Fund or shareholders. For example, information from a portfolio company in which the Fund holds an interest may enable the Adviser to better understand a particular industry and execute trading and investment strategies in reliance on that understanding for the Adviser, its affiliates and Other Clients that do not own an interest in the portfolio company, without compensation or benefit to the Fund or its portfolio companies. Furthermore, except for contractual obligations to third parties to maintain confidentiality of certain information, and regulatory limitations on the use of material nonpublic information, the Adviser may use data and information from the Fund s activities to assist in the pursuit of the Adviser s various other activities, including to trade for the benefit of the Adviser and/or an Other Client. Any confidentiality obligations in the operative documents do not limit the Adviser s ability to do so. For example, the Adviser s ability to trade in securities of an issuer relating to a specific industry may, subject to applicable law, be enhanced by information of a portfolio company in the same or related industry. Such trading can be expected to provide a material benefit to the Adviser without compensation or other benefit to the Fund or shareholders. The sharing and use of big data and other information presents potential conflicts of interest and the shareholders acknowledge and agree that any benefits received by the Adviser or its personnel (including fees, costs and expenses) will not reduce the management fees or incentive fees payable to the Adviser or otherwise be shared with the Fund or shareholders. As a result, the Adviser has an incentive to pursue investments that have data and information that can be utilized in a manner that benefits the Adviser, its affiliates or Other Clients. Material, Non-Public Information. The Adviser and its affiliates will come into possession of confidential information with respect to an issuer. The Adviser may be restricted from buying, originating or selling securities, loans of, or derivatives with respect to, the issuer on behalf of the Fund until such time as the information becomes public or is no longer deemed material such that it would preclude the Fund from participating in an investment. Disclosure of such information to the Adviser s personnel responsible for the affairs of the Fund will be on a need-to-know basis only, and the Fund may not be free to act for the Fund upon any such information. Therefore, the Fund may not have access to confidential information in the possession of the Adviser that might be relevant to an investment decision to be made for the Fund. In addition, the Adviser, in an effort to avoid buying or selling restrictions on behalf of the Fund or Other Clients, may choose to forego an opportunity to receive (or elect not to receive) information that other market participants or counterparties, including those with the same positions in the issuer as the Fund, are eligible to receive or have received, even if possession of such information would otherwise be advantageous to the Fund. In addition, affiliates of the Adviser within Fidelity may come into possession of confidential information with respect to an issuer. The Adviser may be restricted from buying, originating or selling securities, loans of, or derivatives with respect to, the issuer on behalf of the Fund if the Adviser deemed such restriction appropriate. Disclosure of such information to the Adviser s personnel responsible for the affairs of the Fund will be on a need-to-know basis only, and the Fund may not be free to act upon any such information. Therefore, the Fund may not have access to confidential information in the possession of the Adviser or its affiliates that might be relevant to an investment decision to be made by the Fund. Accordingly, the Fund may not be able to initiate a transaction that it otherwise might have initiated and may not be able to sell an investment that it otherwise might have sold. Loan Agreements with Affiliates . The Fund may enter into loan agreements with the Adviser or its affiliates. The Adviser and its affiliates have a conflict of interest between the obligation to act in the Fund s best interest and the Adviser or affiliate s own best interest. Any such loans or advances made to the Fund will be consistent with applicable law, the Adviser s fiduciary obligations to act in the Fund s best interests, the Fund s investment objectives, and the asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act. The terms associated with any such loans from the Adviser or its affiliates, including the interest charged, shall, in the aggregate, be no more favorable to the Adviser or its affiliates than could be obtained in an arm s-length transaction but will not necessarily be on the same terms or at the same interest rate charged by the Adviser to other funds that it manages. Neither the Adviser nor any of its affiliates is obligated to extend any such loans to the Fund and such loans will not necessarily be made available to the Fund in the same amounts or on the same economic terms as are made available to other funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates, or at all. In the event that the Fund is required to find third-party financing in place of or in addition to loans from the Adviser and its affiliates, such third-party financing could be at less favorable economic terms than the loans from the Adviser and its affiliates, which could reduce the Fund s returns. Buying and Selling Investments or Assets from Certain Related Parties . The Fund and its portfolio companies may purchase investments or assets from or sell investments or assets to shareholders, other portfolio companies of the Fund, portfolio companies of Other Clients or their respective related parties. Purchases and sales of investments or assets between the Fund or its portfolio companies, on the one hand, and shareholders, other portfolio companies of the Fund, portfolio companies of Other Clients or their respective related parties, on the other hand, are not, unless required by applicable law, subject to the approval of the Board or any shareholder. These transactions involve conflicts of interest, as the Adviser may receive fees and other benefits, directly or indirectly, from or otherwise have interests in both parties to the transaction, including different financial incentives Fidelity may have with respect to the parties to the transaction. For example, there can be no assurance that any investment or asset sold by the Fund to a shareholder, other portfolio companies of the Fund, portfolio company of Other Clients or any of their respective related parties will not be valued or allocated a sale price that is lower than might otherwise have been the case if such asset were sold to a third party rather than to a shareholder, portfolio company of Other Clients or any of their respective related parties. The Adviser will not be required to solicit third party bids or obtain a third-party valuation prior to causing the Fund or any of its portfolio companies to purchase or sell any asset or investment from or to a shareholder, other portfolio companies of the Fund, portfolio company of Other Clients or any of their respective related parties as provided above. Other Affiliate Transactions and Investments in Different Levels of Capital Structure . From time to time, the Fund and the Other Clients may make investments at different levels of an issuer s capital structure or otherwise in different classes of an issuer s securities or loans, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act. While less common, subject to applicable law, from time to time the Fund could hold an investment in a different layer of the capital structure than an investor or another party with which the Adviser or its affiliates have a material relationship, in which case the Adviser or its affiliates could have an incentive to cause the Fund or the portfolio company to offer more favorable terms to such parties (including, for instance, financing arrangements). Such investments may inherently give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest between or among the various classes of securities or loans that may be held by such entities. To the extent the Fund holds securities or loans that are different (including with respect to their relative seniority) than those held by an Other Client, the Adviser and its affiliates may be presented with decisions when the interests of the funds are in conflict. For example, conflicts could arise where the Fund lends funds to a portfolio company while an Other Client invests in equity securities of such portfolio company. In this circumstance, for example, if such portfolio company were to go into bankruptcy, become insolvent or otherwise be unable to meet its payment obligations or comply with its debt covenants, conflicts of interest could arise between the holders of different types of securities or loans as to what actions the portfolio company should take. Further conflicts could arise after the Fund and Other Clients have made their respective initial investments. For example, if additional financing is necessary as a result of financial or other difficulties, it may not be in the best interests of the Fund to provide such additional financing. If the Other Clients were to lose their respective investments as a result of such difficulties, the ability of the Adviser to recommend actions in the best interests of the Fund might be impaired. Any applicable co-investment order issued by the SEC may restrict the Fund s ability to participate in follow-on financings. The Adviser may in its discretion take steps to reduce the potential for adversity between the Fund and the Other Clients, including causing the Fund and/or such Other Clients to take certain actions that, in the absence of such conflict, it would not take. Such conflicts will be more difficult if the Fund and Other Clients hold significant or controlling interests in competing or different tranches of a portfolio company s capital structure. Equity holders and debt holders have different (and often competing) motives, incentives, liquidity goals and other interests with respect to a portfolio company. In addition, there may be circumstances where the Adviser agrees to implement certain procedures to ameliorate conflicts of interest that may involve a forbearance of rights relating to the Fund or Other Clients, such as where the Adviser or its affiliates may cause the Fund or Other Clients to decline to exercise certain control-and/or foreclosure-related rights with respect to a portfolio company. Further, the Fund is prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain affiliates (including portfolio companies of Other Clients) without the prior approval of a majority of the independent members of the Board and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5 or more of the outstanding voting securities will be an affiliate of the Fund for purposes of the 1940 Act and generally the Fund will be prohibited from buying or selling any securities from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of the Board. However, the Fund may under certain circumstances purchase any such affiliate s loans or securities in the secondary market, which could create a conflict for the Adviser between the Fund s interests and the interests of such affiliate, in that the ability of the Adviser to recommend actions in the Fund s best interest may be limited. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain joint transactions with certain affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or closely related times), without prior approval of the Board and, in some cases, the SEC. In addition, conflicts may arise in determining the amount of an investment, if any, to be allocated among potential investors and the respective terms thereof. There can be no assurance that any conflict will be resolved in favor of the Fund, and in some cases, subject to applicable law, a decision by the Adviser to take any particular action could have the effect of benefiting an Other Client (and, incidentally, may also have the effect of benefiting the Adviser and its affiliates) and therefore may not have been in the best interests of, and may be adverse to, the Fund. There can be no assurance that the return on the Fund s investment will be equivalent to or better than the returns obtained by the Other Clients participating in the transaction. Related Financing Counterparties . The Fund may invest in companies or other entities in which Other Clients make an investment in a different part of the capital structure (and vice versa) subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and the Fund s co-investment order. The Adviser and its affiliates take into account various facts and circumstances they deem relevant in selecting financing sources, including whether a potential lender has expressed an interest in evaluating debt financing opportunities, whether a potential lender has a history of participating in debt financing opportunities generally and with the Adviser in particular, the size of the potential lender s loan amount, the timing of the relevant cash requirement, the availability of other sources of financing, the creditworthiness of the lender, whether the potential lender has demonstrated a long-term or continuing commitment to the success of the Adviser, its affiliates and their funds, and such other factors that the Adviser and its affiliates deem relevant under the circumstances. The cost of debt alone is not determinative. It is possible that shareholders, Other Clients, their portfolio companies, co-investors and other parties with material relationships with the Adviser, such as shareholders of and lenders to the Adviser and its affiliates and lenders to Other Clients and their portfolio companies, could provide additional first lien financing to portfolio companies of the Fund, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. The Adviser could have incentives to cause the Fund and its portfolio companies to accept less favorable financing terms from a shareholder, Other Clients, their portfolio companies, Fidelity, and other parties with material relationships with the Adviser than it would from a third party. If the Fund or a portfolio company occupies a more senior position in the capital structure than a shareholder, Other Client, their portfolio companies and other parties with material relationships with the Adviser, the Adviser could have an incentive to cause the Fund or portfolio company to offer more favorable financing terms to such parties. In the case of a related party financing between the Fund or its portfolio companies, on the one hand, and the Adviser or Other Clients portfolio companies, on the other hand, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, the Adviser could, but is not obligated to, rely on a third party agent to confirm the terms offered by the counterparty are consistent with market terms, or the Adviser could instead rely on its own internal analysis, which the Adviser believes is often superior to third party analysis given the scale of the Adviser and its affiliates in the market. If, however, any of the Adviser, the Fund, an Other Client or any of their portfolio companies delegates to a third party, such as another member of a financing syndicate or a joint venture partner, the negotiation of the terms of the financing, the transaction will be assumed to be conducted on an arms-length basis, even though the participation of the Adviser related vehicle impacts the market terms. For example, in the case of a loan extended to the Fund or a portfolio company by a financing syndicate in which an Other Client has agreed to participate on terms negotiated by a third party participant in the syndicate, it may have been necessary to offer better terms to the financing provider to fully subscribe the syndicate if the Other Client had not participated. It is also possible that the frequent participation of Other Clients in such syndicates could dampen interest among other potential financing providers, thereby lowering demand to participate in the syndicate and increasing the financing costs to the Fund. The Adviser does not believe either of these effects is significant, but no assurance can be given to shareholders that these effects will not be significant in any circumstance. Unless required by applicable law, the Adviser will not seek any consent or approvals from shareholders or the Board in the case of any of these conflicts. The Adviser and its affiliates could cause actions adverse to the Fund to be taken for the benefit of Other Clients that have made an investment more senior in the capital structure of a portfolio company than the Fund e.g ., provide financing to a portfolio company, the equity of which is owned by the Fund) and, vice versa, actions may be taken for the benefit of the Fund and its portfolio companies that are adverse to Other Clients. The Adviser and its affiliates could seek to implement procedures to mitigate conflicts of interest in these situations such as (i) a forbearance of rights, including some or all non-economic rights, by the Fund or relevant Other Client (or their respective portfolio companies, as the case may be) by, for example, agreeing to follow the vote of a third party in the same tranche of the capital structure, or otherwise deciding to recuse itself with respect to decisions on defaults, foreclosures, workouts, restructurings and other similar matters, (ii) causing the Fund or relevant Other Client (or their respective portfolio companies, as the case may be) to hold only a non-controlling interest in any such portfolio company, (iii) retaining a third party loan servicer, administrative agent or other agent to make decisions on behalf of the Fund or relevant Other Client (or their respective portfolio companies, as the case may be), or (iv) create groups of personnel within the Adviser and its affiliates separated by information barriers (which may be temporary and limited purpose in nature), each of which would advise one of the clients that has a conflicting position with other clients. As an example, to the extent an Other Client holds an interest in a loan or security that is different (including with respect to relative seniority) than those held by the Fund or its portfolio companies, the Adviser may decline to exercise, or delegate to a third party, certain control, foreclosure and other similar governance rights of the Other Client. In these cases, the Adviser would generally act on behalf of one of its clients, though the other client would generally retain certain control rights, such as the right to consent to certain actions taken by the trustee or administrative or other agent of the investment, including a release, waiver, forgiveness or reduction of any claim for principal or interest; extension of maturity date or due date of any payment of any principal or interest; release or substitution of any material collateral; release, waiver, termination or modification of any material provision of any guaranty or indemnity; subordination of any lien; and release, waiver or permission with respect to any covenants. In addition, it is anticipated that in a bankruptcy proceeding the Fund s interests will likely be subordinated or otherwise adverse to the interests of Other Clients with ownership positions that are more senior to those of the Fund. For example, an Other Client that has provided debt financing to an investment of the Fund may take actions for its benefit, particularly if the Fund s investment is in financial distress, which adversely impact the value of the Fund s subordinated interests. Although Other Clients can be expected to provide financing to the Fund and its portfolio companies subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, there can be no assurance that any Other Client will indeed provide any such financing with respect to any particular investment. Participation by Other Clients in some but not all financings of the Fund and its portfolio companies may adversely impact the ability of the Fund and its portfolio companies to obtain financing from third parties when Other Clients do not participate, as it may serve as a negative signal to market participants. Any financing provided by a shareholder or an affiliate to the Fund or a portfolio company is not an investment in the Fund. The respective investment programs of the Fund and the Other Clients may or may not be substantially similar. The Adviser and its affiliates may give advice to, and recommend securities for, Other Clients that may differ from advice given to, or securities recommended or bought for, the Fund, even though their investment objectives may be the same as or similar to those of the Fund. While the Adviser will seek to manage potential conflicts of interest in a fair and equitable manner, the portfolio strategies employed by the Adviser and its affiliates in managing their respective Other Clients are likely to conflict from time to time with the transactions and strategies employed by the Adviser in managing the Fund and may affect the prices and availability of the securities and instruments in which the Fund invests. Conversely, participation in specific investment opportunities may be appropriate, at times, for both the Fund and Other Clients. In any event, it is the policy of the Adviser to allocate investment opportunities and sale opportunities on a basis deemed by the Adviser, in its sole discretion, to be fair and equitable over time. Joint Ventures. The Fund or the Adviser may partner with one or more unaffiliated banks or other financial institutions to make particular investments or types of investments, with, in some instances, such partners having senior exposure to the investment program and the Fund and Other Clients participating in the junior exposure or vice versa. In doing so, the Adviser would seek to benefit from the larger combined capital base of working with a partner, as well as such partner s sourcing channels and expertise. In addition, the Fund may be an initial economic participant in such an investment program or may join the investment program after it has made investments. As a result, the Fund may or may not share in the returns of the investments that have already been originated and, accordingly the returns realized by the Fund investors may differ from the returns realized by other participants of such investment program. The structure of this type of investment program will vary and will be determined on a case-by-case basis in order to accommodate the nature of the arrangements, applicable bank and other regulatory restrictions, particular considerations applicable to the funds and accounts participating in the investment program, tax considerations, and other factors. For example, the investment program may be structured so that the Fund purchases debt of a holding company (the JV Participant and the JV Participant then participates in the joint venture or the investments sourced through the joint venture. In such a situation, the equity of the JV Participant is expected to be held by Other Clients. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise between the Fund (as debt holders of the JV Participant) and the Other Clients participating in the investment program (as equity holders of the JV Participant). These conflicts of interest would be magnified in the event of any default, bankruptcy or similar event of financial distress with respect to the JV Participant. Further, the returns realized by the Fund are likely to differ from the returns realized by the Other Clients participating in the investment program. In such a structure, the Fund as a debt holder will have more enhanced downside protection than the Other Clients but will not benefit from all of the upside from the underlying investments, whereas the Other Clients, while being subject to a greater risk of loss, will also benefit from greater upside than the Fund. The Fund s joint venture partner may be a regulated banking entity, and the joint venture vehicle may be subject to bank regulation as a result of the bank s ownership interest therein. As a result, there is a risk that the joint venture could be subject to bank regulatory audit and review, as well as potential fines or other enforcement actions that the Fund, acting on its own, would not otherwise be subject. While the bank joint venture partner would be expected to assume some of these liabilities directly, the JV Participant would nevertheless have some exposure, potentially in respect of larger liabilities. Such liabilities could be significant. Furthermore, the activities of the joint venture may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to the bank or its internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or that otherwise relate to such requirements. The Adviser believes that any such joint venture will be structured in a manner that would not cause a violation of applicable banking laws and regulations. However, it is possible that future changes or clarifications in statutes, regulations or interpretations concerning the permissible activities of bank holding companies, as well as further judicial or administrative decisions and interpretations of present or future statutes or regulations could restrict (or possibly prevent) the banking partner from continuing to participate in the joint venture in the manner originally contemplated. In such event, the Adviser and the applicable banking partner may agree to alter or restrict the investment program or may elect to terminate the investment program altogether. Any such restructuring or termination may adversely affect the returns realized by the Fund in connection with its participation in the investment program. Certain Investments Inside the Fund s Mandate that are not Pursued by the Fund. Under certain circumstances, the Adviser may determine not to pursue some or all of an investment opportunity within the Fund s mandate pursuant to its investment allocation policies and procedures, including without limitation, as a result of business, reputational or other reasons applicable to the Fund, Other Clients, their respective portfolio companies or the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser may determine that the Fund should not pursue some or all of an investment opportunity, including, by way of example and without limitation, because the Fund has already invested sufficient capital in the investment, sector, industry, geographic region or markets in question, as determined by the Adviser in its good faith discretion, or the investment is not appropriate for the Fund for other reasons as determined by the Adviser in its good faith reasonable sole discretion. In any such case the Adviser or its affiliates could, thereafter, offer such opportunity to other parties, including Other Clients or portfolio companies or limited partners or shareholders of the Fund or Other Clients, joint venture partners, related parties or third parties. Any such Other Clients may be advised by a different FDS affiliate, which could determine an investment opportunity to be more attractive than the Adviser believes to be the case. In any event, there can be no assurance that the Adviser s assessment will prove correct or that the performance of any investments actually pursued by the Fund will be comparable to any investment opportunities that are not pursued by the Fund. The Adviser and its affiliates, including their personnel, may receive compensation from any such party that makes the investment, including an allocation of carried interest or referral fees, and any such compensation could be greater than amounts paid by the Fund to the Adviser. In some cases, the Adviser or its affiliates earn greater fees when Other Clients participate alongside or instead of the Fund in an investment. Allocation of Revolver, Delayed-Draw Investment or Line of Credit Obligations . The Fund generally expects to participate in one or more investments that are structured as revolvers, delayed-draws or lines of credit with funding obligations that extend past the initial date of investment. Later funding obligations related to such investments may not be allocated pro rata among all the investors who participated in the initial funding of an investment. In particular, the Fund may participate in the initial funding of an investment, but may not participate in later-arising funding obligations i.e ., the revolver, delayed-draw or line of credit portions) related to such investment, including because of capacity limitations that an investment vehicle may have for making new revolver, delayed-draw investments or lines of credit. As a result, the Fund may be allocated a smaller or larger portion of revolver, delayed-draw investments or lines of credit than other investors participating in the loan (or may not be allocated any portion). Fund investors that participate in the initial funding of an investment may receive certain economic benefits in connection with such initial funding, such as OID, closing payments, or commitment fees and these benefits are expected to be allocated based on participation in the initial funding, regardless of participation in future funding obligations. In addition, where the Fund and any other participating investors have not participated in each funding of an investment on a pro rata basis, conflicts of interest may arise between the Fund and the other investors as the interests of the Fund and the other investors may not be completely aligned with respect to such investment. In that regard, the revolver, delayed draw or line of credit portion of an investment may be senior to the investment in the portfolio company made by the Fund, and as a result, the interests of the Fund may not be aligned with other participating investors. Insurance. The Adviser will cause the Fund to purchase, and/or bear premiums, fees, costs and expenses (including any expenses or fees of insurance brokers) for insurance to insure the Fund and the Board against liability in connection with the activities of the Fund. This includes a portion of any premiums, fees, costs and expenses for one or more umbrella, group or other insurance policies maintained by the Adviser or its affiliates that cover the Fund and one or more of the Other Clients, the Adviser, and/or its affiliates (including their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, independent client representative (if any) and other Indemnified Parties). The Adviser will make judgments about the allocation of premiums, fees, costs and expenses for such umbrella, group or other insurance policies among the Fund, one or more Other Clients, the Adviser, and/or its affiliates on a fair and reasonable basis, subject to approval by the Board. Expense Allocations . The Administrator and its affiliates provide, or oversee the provision of, administrative resources to the Fund. The resources provided by the Administrator and its affiliates to the Fund include shared resources among the Fund and Other Clients. The Fund is responsible for paying its allocable share of such expenses. The Administrator takes into account a variety of considerations when allocating such expenses, both between the Administrator/its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Fund and Other Clients on the other, and between and among the Fund and Other Clients. The Administrator seeks to allocate expenses using fair and reasonable methodologies. The Administrator will make judgments about the allocation of fees, costs and expenses among the Fund, one or more Other Clients, the Adviser, the Administrator and/or its affiliates on a fair and reasonable basis, subject to oversight of the Board. Additional Potential Conflicts of Interest . The officers, directors, members, managers, employees and personnel of the Adviser, as applicable, may trade in securities for their own accounts, subject to restrictions and reporting requirements as may be required by law or the policies of the Adviser and its affiliates, or otherwise determined from time to time by the Adviser. In addition, certain Other Clients may be subject to the 1940 Act or other regulations that, due to the role of the Adviser or its affiliates, could restrict the ability of the Fund to buy investments from, to sell investments to or to invest in the same securities as, such Other Clients. Such regulations may have the effect of limiting the investment opportunities available to the Fund. Finally, although Fidelity believes its positive reputation in the marketplace provides benefit to the Fund and Other Clients, the Adviser could decline to undertake investment activity or transact with a counterparty on behalf of the Fund for reputational reasons, and this decision could result in the Fund foregoing a profit or suffering a loss. The foregoing list of conflicts does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the actual and potential conflicts involved in an investment in the Fund. Prospective investors should read the Fund s prospectus and consult with their own advisers before deciding whether to invest in the Fund. In addition, as the Fund s investment program develops and changes over time, an investment in the Fund may be subject to additional and different actual and potential conflicts. Although the various conflicts discussed herein are generally described separately, prospective investors should consider the potential effects of the interplay of multiple conflicts. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 None. 
 Item 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 Fidelity and its Enterprise Cybersecurity organization, on behalf of the Fund, have established a comprehensive risk management program, which includes processes to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks, including material risks from cybersecurity threats, and to put in place appropriate controls to mitigate these risks and reduce the potential impact to the Fund and its shareholders. The Fund does not currently have any employees and relies upon Fidelity and its Enterprise Cybersecurity organization for the Fund s day-to-day operations and to establish strategies, policies, and standards for the security of, and operations in, cyberspace. 
 The Fund depends on and engages various third parties, including suppliers, vendors, and service providers, to operate its business. Through its vendor management program, and on behalf of the Fund, Fidelity oversees and identifies risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers. This vendor oversight program includes periodic reviews of the cybersecurity controls of third-party service providers, The frequency of such reviews is generally based on the nature of the Fund s information processed by the vendor and the vendor s criticality to business operations. 
 On behalf of the Fund, Fidelity engages third-party consultants to assess, identify, and/or manage material risks from cybersecurity threats. For example, Fidelity engages third-party consultants to perform audits of its cybersecurity measures and risk management processes, including those applicable to the Fund. Fidelity has also hired qualified independent assessors to review applicable security controls in accordance with the AICPA s System and Organization Controls assurance programs. Additionally, Fidelity utilizes third-party consultants with specific areas of cybersecurity expertise to review and report on various aspects of its cybersecurity program, including those applicable to the Fund. The results of these consulting engagements are shared with the Fund s Board of Trustees as part of periodic reports. 
 Fidelity s Enterprise Cybersecurity organization has a threat intelligence program which monitors for emerging cyber threats. Taking information gathered from public and private sources, including industry groups such as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the organization analyzes such information and incorporates tactics, techniques, and procedures into the program s security monitoring and detection tools and processes. 
 The potential impact of risks from cybersecurity threats on the Fund are assessed on an ongoing basis, and how such risks could materially affect the Fund s business strategy, operational results, and financial condition are regularly evaluated. During the reporting period, the Fund did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Fund, including its day-to-day operations, financial condition, and business strategies. In conjunction with Fidelity s Enterprise Cybersecurity, the Fund participates in regular testing of applicable incident response processes to ensure appropriate escalation, mitigation, communication and reporting processes are in place. 
 73 

The Board provides strategic oversight regarding cybersecurity risks and threats. The Board receives and reviews periodic reports from senior executives in Fidelity s enterprise cybersecurity organization and the Fund s management, including Fidelity s Chief Information Security Officer CISO ), members of the CISO s staff and the Fund s CCO. These reports contain information about risks from cybersecurity threats, including the results of recent independent reviews of the cybersecurity program, summaries of recent cybersecurity threat intelligence assessments, progress on key initiatives and strategies, and updates on recent regulatory activities, including new regulations and examinations. 
 The Fund s management, including the CCO of the Fund, is responsible for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. In connection with the Fund s reliance on Fidelity and its Enterprise Cybersecurity organization, the CCO relies on the cybersecurity expertise of Fidelity s CISO and members of the CISO s staff to assist in assessing and managing the Fund s material risks from cybersecurity threats. The CISO has over twenty years of experience in technology and information security and has served as Fidelity s CISO since May 2021. The CCO has been responsible for this oversight function as CCO to the Fund since the Fund s inception and has worked in the financial services industry for sixteen years, during which the CCO has gained expertise in assessing and managing risks applicable to the company. 
 Management of the Fund is informed about and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents impacting the Fund, including through the receipt of notifications from service providers and reliance on communications with risk management, legal, information technology, and/or compliance personnel of Fidelity. The Board is also made aware of material cybersecurity incidents which impacted the Fund. 
 Item 2. Propert ies. 
 We do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operation. Our corporate headquarters are located at 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is currently conducted. 
 Item 3. Legal P roceedings. 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceedings threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such legal or regulatory framework cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 Not Applicable.

PART II 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 Share Issuances 
 The Offering consists of three classes of shares of our Common Stock, Class I shares, Class S shares, and Class D shares. The share classes have different ongoing shareholder servicing fees. Other than the differences in ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, each class of Common Stock has the same economics and voting rights. Shares of our common stock are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market and there is no established public trading market for our common stock. 
 As of March 18, 2024 there were 2,915 holders of record of our Class I common stock, 1 holder of record of our Class S common stock, and 1 holder of record of our Class D common stock. 
 We expect to determine our NAV for each class of shares each month as of the last day of each calendar month. The NAV per share for each class of shares is determined by dividing the value of total assets attributable to the class minus liabilities attributable to the class by the total number of Common Shares outstanding of the class at the date as of which the determination is made. 
 The following table presents our monthly NAV per share for each of the classes of shares since our inception through December 31, 2023:

Distributions 
 We have paid regular monthly distributions commencing with the first full calendar quarter after the escrow period concluded. Any distributions we make will be at the discretion of our Board, considering factors such as our earnings, cash flow, capital needs and general financial condition and the requirements of Delaware law. As a result, our distribution rates and payment frequency may vary from time to time. 
 Our Board s discretion as to the payment of distributions will be directed, in substantial part, by its determination to cause us to comply with the RIC requirements. To maintain our treatment as a RIC, we generally are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our shareholders of at least 90 of investment company taxable income. See Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations . 
 The per share amount of distributions on Class S, Class D and Class I shares generally differ because of different class-specific shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees that are deducted from the gross distributions for each share class. Specifically, distributions on Class S shares will be lower than Class D shares and Class I shares, and distributions on Class D shares will be lower than Class I shares because we are required to pay higher ongoing shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to the Class S shares (compared to Class D shares and Class I shares), and we are required to pay higher ongoing shareholder servicing fees with respect to Class D shares (compared to Class I shares).

Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fees 
 The following table shows the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees we pay the Managing Dealer with respect to the Class S, Class D and Class I on an annualized basis as a percentage of our NAV for such class. Subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation, the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month. 

Shareholder Servicing and/ or Distribution Fee as a of NAV 

Class S shares 

0.85 

Class D shares 

0.25 

Class I shares 

Subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation described in Limitations on Underwriting Compensation below, we will pay a shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee equal to 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV for the Class S shares, a shareholder servicing fee equal to 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV for the Class D shares, in each case, payable monthly. 
 The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid monthly in arrears. The Managing Dealer will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan. 
 76 

Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding us, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Managing Dealer will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase. 
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends or distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends or distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board of Trustees may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our operations. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The information in this section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
 Overview 
 We are a newly organized, externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company formed as a Delaware statutory trust on March 23, 2022 that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, determining the value of Fund investments, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. We also intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code. 
 An externally-managed BDC generally does not have any employees, and its investment and management functions are provided by an outside investment adviser and administrator under an advisory agreement and administration agreement. Instead of directly compensating employees, we pay FDS for investment and management services pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. The Fund intends to operate as a non-exchange traded, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. The Fund uses the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration, whose shares of common stock are intended to be sold by the Fund on a continuous basis at a price generally equal to the Fund s NAV per share. 
 Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Fund will achieve these objectives primarily through directly originated loans to private companies but also liquid credit investments, like broadly syndicated loans, and other select Private Credit investments. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80 of its total assets in Private Credit investments. If the Fund changes its 80 test, the Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60 days prior notice of such change. The Adviser may also invest to a lesser degree in equity linked instruments (which may include debt with warrants, preferred equity investments, or equity co-investments). Most of our investments will be in private U.S. operating companies, but (subject to compliance with BDCs requirement to invest at least 70 of its assets in private U.S. companies) we may also invest to a lesser degree in non-U.S. companies. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other affiliated funds. From time to time, we may co-invest with other affiliated funds. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on loans and securities, including syndicated loans, of private U.S. companies. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, trading prices of loans and other securities and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. OIDs and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 78 

Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. The Administrator or its affiliates will bear all fees, costs, and expenses incurred that are not specifically assumed by the Fund under the Administration Agreement. 
 The Adviser and/or its affiliates agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf through the date on which we broke escrow for our Offering. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, for the twelve month period commencing the date of Agreement, September 23, 2022, and unless terminated, for each successive one year period, the Adviser is obligated to advance all of our Other Operating Expenses (including organizational and offering expenses) to the effect that such expenses do not exceed 0.70 (on an annualized basis) of the Fund s NAV. We will be obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses only if certain conditions are met. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. 
 From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator) or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser or Administrator) or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, FDS (in its capacity as the Adviser and Administrator) may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders, subject to the cap on Other Operating Expenses described above. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with our Adviser. As of March 13, 2023, FDS has voluntarily agreed to waive its right to receive any Reimbursement Payment for any Excess Operating Funds incurred in any month prior to a revocation. Any such amounts shall not be considered unreimbursed Expense Payments reimbursable in future months pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. This voluntary arrangement can be terminated at any time, upon thirty days prior written notice to the Fund. For additional information, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired 534.7 million aggregate principal amount of investments (including 99.3 million of unfunded commitments). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had no portfolio investment activity.

Our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each portfolio company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

80 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company s industry; and 

review of monthly or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

As part of the monitoring process, our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser rates the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The rating system is as follows: 
 1 The portfolio investment is performing above our underwriting expectations. 
 2 The portfolio investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting. As a general rule, new investments are initially rated a 2. 
 3 The portfolio investment is operating below our underwriting expectations and requires closer monitoring. The company may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, principal or interest payments are generally not past due. 
 4 The portfolio investment is performing materially below our underwriting expectations and returns on our investment are likely to be impaired. Principal or interest payments may be past due, however, full recovery of principal and interest payments are expected. 
 5 The portfolio investment is performing significantly below expectations and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. The company is in payment default and the principal and interest payments are not expected to be repaid in full. 
 The following table shows the composition of our debt portfolio on the 1 to 5 rating scale as of December 31, 2023

Results of Operations 
 On March 13, 2023, we commenced operations and accepted 102.1 million of subscriptions. 
 The following table represents the operating results: 

Year Ended December 31, 2023 

For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 

Total investment income 

26,391,281

6,944,914 

Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 

27,449,812 

81 

Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. As a result, comparisons may not be meaningful. 
 Investment Income 
 Investment income was as follows: 

Year Ended December 31, 2023 

For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 

Interest income 

25,116,260 

Dividend income 

1,275,021 

Total Investment Income 

26,391,281 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, total investment income was 26.4 million, driven by our deployment of capital during the year. The size of our investment portfolio at fair value was 531.5 million at December 31, 2023 and our weighted average yield on debt and income producing investments, at fair value, was 11.55 . For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 there was no net investment income recorded as the Fund had not yet broken escrow and settled purchase of any investments. 
 Rising interest rates have favorably impacted our investment income during 2023 due to the floating rate nature of our investments. Despite constructing our portfolio factoring in higher interest rates when determining appropriate capital structures of our borrowers, continued interest rate increases and the resulting higher cost of capital have the potential to negatively impact the free cash flow of certain borrowers which could impact their ability to service their debt. Additionally, if higher interest rates occur concurrently during a slowdown in growth or period of economic weakness, our borrowers and potentially our portfolio performance may be negatively impacted. Alternatively, if interest rates decline, our investment income on the existing investment portfolio could be negatively impacted. 
 Expenses 
 Expenses were as follows:

Net Expenses

Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense (including unused fees and amortization of deferred financing costs) of 3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, was driven by borrowings under our credit facilities subsequent to our commencement of operations. 
 82 

For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 no amount of interest expense was incurred as the Fund had not yet commenced operations. 
 Management Fees 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, management fees were 2.5 million. The Adviser waived management fees from March 13, 2023 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2023, which resulted in a waiver of 2.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no management fees recorded or waived for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. Management fees are payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. 
 Income Based Incentive Fees 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, income based incentive fees were 2.7 million. The Adviser waived income based incentive fees from March 13, 2023 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2023, which resulted in a waiver of 2.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no income based incentive fees recorded or waived for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. 
 Capital Gains Based Incentive Fees 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, we accrued capital gains incentive fees of 0.9 million, none of which was payable under the Advisory Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the accrued incentive fees were attributable to net unrealized gains of 6.9 million. There were no capital gains incentive fees accrued for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Organization costs and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our continuous Offering. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, technology and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Fund. Administrative fees represent expenses incurred for services provided by FDS in its capacity as Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Administration Agreement. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Total other expenses increased to 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 0.8 million for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 primarily driven by the larger portfolio and associated costs with managing the Fund. 
 We entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify annually for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual required distributable amount of income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 83 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Fund did not incur any U.S. federal income taxes, but the Fund did incur 0.1 million of excise taxes. The Fund did not incur any U.S. federal income taxes or excise taxes for the period ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) was comprised of the following: 

Year Ended December 31, 2023 

For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 

Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on non-controlled / non-affiliate investments 

6,560,468 

Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on non-controlled / affiliate investments 

358,609 

Net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on assets and liabilities in foreign currencies 

25,837 

Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 

6,944,914 

The net change in unrealized appreciation for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to spread tightening in the credit markets and positive portfolio company performance. For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 there was no net change in unrealized appreciation as the Fund had not yet broken escrow and settled purchase of any investments. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous Offering of Common Shares, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facility, income earned and repayments on principal on our debt investments. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (i) originating and purchasing debt and other investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs, (iv) funding repurchases under our share repurchase program and (v) cash distributions to the holders of our shares. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had one revolving credit facility outstanding. The Fund may, from time to time, enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facility or issue additional debt securities, including debt securitizations, unsecured debt or other forms of debt. Any such incurrence or issuance may be from sources within the U.S. or from various foreign geographies or jurisdictions and may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of December 31, 2023, we had 105.8 million of debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and our asset coverage ratio was 483 . 
 Cash as of December 31, 2023, taken together with our 375.2 million of available capacity under our credit facility (subject to borrowing base availability), proceeds from new or amended financing arrangements and the continuous Offering of our Common Shares is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. This determination is based in part on our expectations for the timing of funding investment purchases and the timing and amount of future proceeds from sales of our Common Shares and the use of existing and future financing arrangements. We plan to fund using proceeds from offering our Common Shares and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities for new investments. 
 Although we were able to secure financing in 2023, any disruption in the financial markets or any other negative economic development could restrict our access to financing in the future. We may not be able to find new financing for future investments or liquidity needs and, even if we are able to obtain such financing, such financing may not be on as favorable terms as we could have obtained previously. These factors may limit our ability to make new investments and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 84 

As of December 31, 2023, we had 1.1 million in cash and 0.3 million in foreign cash. During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 481.5 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments. Cash provided by financing activities was 483.0 million during the period, primarily as a result of new share issuances and net borrowings under our credit facility. 
 During the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, the Fund had not yet commenced operations and cash flows consisted of the seed capital. 
 Equity 
 As of March 13, 2023, the Fund satisfied the minimum offering requirement, and the Fund s Board of Trustees authorized the release of proceeds from escrow.

For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 there were no distributions. 
 With respect to distributions, the Fund has adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders (other than shareholders residing in certain states that require an opt in plan). As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. Shareholders located in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, as well as those who are clients of certain participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan, will automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan and have their cash distributions reinvested in additional Common Shares. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The following table reflects the sources of cash distributions on a U.S. GAAP basis that we declared on our shares of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023:

Share Repurchase Program 
 At the discretion of the Board, the Fund has commenced a share repurchase program in which the Fund may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the NAV of the Fund s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Fund s liquidity, adversely affect the Fund s operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Fund that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. The Fund intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase plan, to the extent the Fund offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at an Early Repurchase Deduction. The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders across all shares.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not expect to have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. 
 Our investment portfolio contains and is expected to continue to contain debt investments in the form of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the underlying loan agreements. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had unfunded commitments to borrowers in the aggregate principal amount of 99.3 million and 0, respectively. 
 From time to time, the Fund may become party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2023, management is not aware of any pending or threatened litigation.

Affiliated investments;

an agreement with Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company LLC relating to transfer agency services. 

In addition to the aforementioned agreements, we, our Adviser, and certain of our Adviser s affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Financial Statements Note 3. Related Party Agreements and Transactions . 
 Recent Developments 
 See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Financial Statements Note 12. Subsequent Events for a summary of recent developments. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Fund values its investments, upon which its NAV is based, in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure fair value and prescribes disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5, the Board has designated the Adviser as the valuation designee responsible for valuing all of the Fund s investments, including making fair valuation determinations as needed. The Adviser has established a Fair Value Committee to carry out the day-to-day fair valuation responsibilities and has adopted policies and procedures to govern activities of the Fair Value Committee and the performance of functions required to determine the fair value of a fund s investments in good faith. These functions include periodically assessing and managing material risks associated with fair value determinations, selecting, applying, reviewing, and testing fair value methodologies, monitoring for circumstances that may necessitate the use of fair value, and overseeing and evaluating pricing services used. 
 In accordance with the Adviser s policies and procedures, which have been approved by the Board, investments, including debt securities, that are publicly traded but for which no readily available market quotations exist are generally valued on the basis of information furnished by an independent third-party pricing service that uses a valuation matrix which incorporates both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures, engages in oversight activities with respect to third-party pricing sources used and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations or prices received from third-party pricing services are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 89 

Investments that are not publicly traded or whose current market prices or quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by the Adviser in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s Board-approved policies and procedures. Factors used in determining fair value vary by investment type and may include market or investment specific events, transaction data, estimated cash flows, and market observations of comparable investments. In determining fair value of the Fund s loan investments the types of factors that the Fair Value Committee may take into account generally include comparison to publicly-traded securities including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of the portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. 
 The Fund has engaged an independent valuation firm to prepare month-end valuation recommendations for investments for which market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each month. The independent valuation firm undertakes a full analysis of the investments and provides estimated fair values for such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firm also provides analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Adviser s Fair Value Committee reviews and approves each valuation recommendation and confirms it has been calculated in accordance with the Board-approved policies and procedures. The Fair Value Committee manages the Fund s fair valuation practices and maintains the fair valuation policies and procedures. The Adviser reports to the Board information regarding the fair valuation process and related material matters. The Board may determine to modify its designation of the Adviser as valuation designee, relating to any or all Fund investments, at any time. 
 Our accounting policy regarding the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and requires the use of estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining fair value measurements, the fair values of our investments may differ from the amounts that we ultimately realize or collect from sales or maturities of our investments, and the differences could be material. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser, based on, among other things, input from independent third-party valuation firms engaged to review our investments. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we are required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on our investments to be different than the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) reflected in the valuations currently recorded. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates, including changes due to inflation. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 
 90 

As of December 31, 2023, 100 of our debt investments at fair value were at floating rates. Based on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure):

Report of Independent Register ed Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees of Fidelity Private Credit Fund: 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of Fidelity Private Credit Fund (the Fund as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, including the consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the period from March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the period from March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, by correspondence with the custodian, loan agents, borrowers, and brokers; when replies were not received, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Notes t o Consolidated Financial Statements 
 of its total assets in private credit investments. Specific private investments may include: (a) directly originated first lien loans, senior secured revolving lines of credit, term loans and delayed draw term loans, (b) directly originated second lien, last out senior, secured or unsecured mezzanine term loans and delayed draw term loans, (c) club deals (investments generally comprised from a small group of lenders), and broadly syndicated leveraged loans (investments generally arranged or underwritten by investment banks or other intermediaries), and (d) other debt (collectively referred to as "Private Credit"). The Adviser may also invest to a lesser degree in equity linked instruments (may include debt with warrants, preferred equity investments, or equity co-investments). The Adviser may lead and structure the transaction as sole-lender, as the agent of a club credit facility (a group of similar direct lenders that invest in the same tranches), or may participate as a non-agent investor in a large club or syndicated transactions. In order to provide liquidity for share repurchases, the Fund intends to maintain an allocation to syndicated loans and other liquid investments. The Fund will invest at least of its total assets in investments that meet regulatory requirements of the BDC structure, which will generally include investments in companies that are private and may be backed by a Sponsor but may also include investments in small capitalization public companies or companies that are backed by a non-private equity sponsor ownership group. The majority of the Fund s investments will be loans targeted at private U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than . The Fund may also invest to a lesser degree in non-U.S. companies. The Fund offers on a continuous basis up to of common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Shares pursuant to an offering registered with the SEC (the Offering ). The Fund offers to sell any combination of three classes of Common Shares, Class S shares, Class D shares, and Class I shares, with a dollar value up to the maximum offering amount. The share classes have different ongoing distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees. The initial offering price for the Common Shares was per share. Thereafter, the purchase price per share for each class of Common Shares equals the net asset value NAV per share as of the effective date of the monthly share purchase date. 

t have any unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated financial statements; nor is the Fund aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next twelve months. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Fund files a U.S. federal income tax return, in addition to state and local tax returns as required. The Fund s U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a period of three fiscal years after they are filed. State and local tax returns may be subject to examination for an additional fiscal year depending on the jurisdiction. To qualify for and maintain qualification as a RIC, the Fund must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, the Fund must distribute to its shareholders, for each taxable year, at least of its investment company taxable income for that year, which is generally its ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of its realized net short-term capital gains over its realized net long-term capital losses. In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible U.S federal excise tax on undistributed income unless the Fund distributes in a timely manner in each taxable year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) of capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Fund that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. For year ended December 31, 2023 , the Fund did t incur any U.S. federal income taxes, but the Fund did incur excise tax of . 

t hold any cash equivalents. 

For purposes of the Advisory Agreement, net assets mean the Fund s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Fund has operations, net assets will be measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Fund breaks escrow. On August 9, 2023, the Adviser decided to extend the waiver of the Fund s management fee and incentive fee based on income until December 31, 2023. Previously, the Adviser had agreed to waive the management fee and incentive fee based on income for the first six months following the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which occurred on March 13, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, management fees earned were , pro-rated for the period March 13 through December 31, 2023, all of which were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. There were no management fees earned for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , amounts were payable to the Adviser for management fees. In addition, during the period the investment adviser or an affiliate reimbursed and/or waived a portion of management fee expenses from underlying funds in the am ount of . Incentive Fees The incentive fee will consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Fund s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Fund s capital gains, each as described below. Incentive Fee based on Income The incentive fee based on the Fund s income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns attributable to each class of the Fund s Common Shares. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fee, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance and fees earned by the Adviser or an affiliate accrued during the month, minus operating expenses for the month (including the management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement with the Fund s administrator, any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee and shareholder servicing and /or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with payment-in-kind PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that the Fund has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Fund s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of per quarter (5.00 annualized). The Fund will pay the Adviser an income based incentive fee with respect to the Fund s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 

These calculations are pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. On August 9, 2023, the Adviser decided to extend the waiver of the Fund s management fee and incentive fee based on income until December 31, 2023. Previously, the Adviser had agreed to waive the management fee and incentive fee based on income for the first six months following the date on which the Fund broke escrow, which occurred on March 13, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, incentive fees based on income were , all of which was voluntarily waived by the Adviser. There were incentive fees based on incom e for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, amounts were payable to the Adviser for incentive fees based on income. Incentive Fee based on Capital Gains The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains attributable to the applicable share class from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. US GAAP requires that the incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation of investments in the calculation, as an incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Advisory Agreement (the GAAP Incentive Fee ). There can be no assurance that such unrealized appreciation will be realized in the future. Accordingly, such fee, as calculated and accrued, would not necessarily be payable under the Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of incentive fees in subsequent period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, , of expense was recognized related to the GAAP Incentive Fee and is recorded in capital gains incentive fees on the consolidated statements of operations. There was no expense recognized related to the GAAP Incentive Fee For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, related to the GAAP Incentive Fee is recorded in capital gains incentive fee payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, there was amount related to the GAAP Incentive Fee recorded in capital gains incentive fee payable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Administration Agreement The Fund has entered into an Administration Agreement (the Administration Agreement with FDS (the Administrator ). Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides, or oversees the performance of, administrative and compliance services necessary for the Fund's operations, including, but not limited to, maintaining financial records, overseeing the calculation of NAV, compliance monitoring (including diligence and oversight of our other service providers), preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC and other regulators, preparing materials and coordinating meetings of our Board, managing the payment of expenses, the payment and receipt of funds for investments and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others and providing office space, equipment and office services. In consideration of the administrative services provided by the Administrator to the Fund, The fee paid to the Administrator is an expense paid out of the Fund s net assets and is computed based on the value of the net assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month (including any assets in respect of Common Shares that are repurchased as of the end of the quarter). From time to time, FDS, in its capacity as both the Adviser and the Administrator or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. Unless such expenses are specifically assumed by the Adviser, Administrator or its affiliates under the Advisory Agreement or Administration Agreement, the Fund will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on the Fund s behalf. From time to time, the Adviser or the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. Costs and expenses of FDS in its capacity as both the Administrator and the Adviser that are eligible for reimbursement by the Fund will be reasonably allocated to the Fund on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Fund incurred , in expenses under the Administration Agreement, pro-rated for the period March 13, 2023 through December 31, 2023, which were recorded as Administration Fees on the consolidated statements of operations.

In addition, at the end of the month in which the Managing Dealer in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid with respect to any single share held in a shareholder s account would exceed, in the aggregate, 10 of the gross proceeds from the sale of such share (or a lower limit as determined by the Managing Dealer or the applicable broker), the Managing Dealer shall cease receiving the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee on either (i) each such share that would exceed such limit or (ii) all Common Shares in such shareholder s account, in the Managing Dealer s discretion. At the end of such month, the applicable Distribution Shares in such shareholder s account will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV. Either party may terminate the Managing Dealer Agreement upon 60 days written notice to the other party or immediately upon notice to the other party in the event such other party failed to comply with a material provision of the Managing Dealer Agreement. Obligations under the Managing Dealer Agreement to pay the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to the Class S and Class D shares distributed in our Offering as described therein shall survive termination of the agreement until such shares are no longer outstanding (including such shares that have been converted into Class I shares, as described above). Shareholder Servicing and/or Distribution Fees 

Class D shares 

Class I shares 

The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees will be paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the NAV of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month, subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation. The Managing Dealer will reallow (pay) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers, and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class S shares and Class D shares are calculated based on the aggregate NAV for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the NAV with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under our distribution reinvestment plan. Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class S or Class D shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding us, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Managing Dealer will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are ongoing fees that are not paid at the time of purchase. For the period from November 1, 2023 (Class S and Class D inception date) to December 31, 2023, the Fund incurred distribution and shareholder servicing fees of and for Class S and Class D, respectively. No amount was incurred for distribution and shareholder servicing fees for the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 there was payable and recorded in shareholder servicing fee payable. As of December 31, 2022 , there were amounts payable for distribution and shareholder servicing fees. Affiliate Ownership As of December 31, 2022 , an affiliate of the Adviser held shares of the Fund s Class I Common Shares. As of December 31, 2023, an affiliate of the Adviser held shares and shares of the Fund s Class D Common Shares and Class S Common Shares, respectively. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement The Fund has entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, for the twelve month period commencing the date of Agreement, September 23, 2022, and unless terminated, for each successive one year period, the Adviser is obligated to advance all of our Other Operating Expenses (including organizational and offering expenses) to the effect that such expenses do not exceed (on an annualized basis) of the Fund s NAV. Any Required Expense Payment must be paid by the Adviser to the Fund in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds and/or offset against amounts due from the Fund to the Adviser or its affiliates. Other Operating Expenses means the Fund s organization and offering expenses, professional fees (including accounting, legal, and auditing fees), custodian and transfer agent fees, third party valuation agent fees, insurance costs, trustee fees, Administration Fees, and other general and administrative expenses. Upon the termination of Adviser s obligation to make Required Expense Payments, the Adviser may elect to pay, at such times as the Adviser determines, certain expenses on the Fund s behalf, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or distribution and/or shareholder servicing fees of the Fund (referred to as Voluntary Expense Payment and together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments ). Any Voluntary Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Fund in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than 45 days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Fund to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar month in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Fund s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar month (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), the Fund shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Fund within 3 years prior to the last business day of such calendar month have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Fund shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Fund s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Fund s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Fund on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). No Reimbursement Payment for any month shall be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share declared by the Fund at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, (2) the Fund s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relate, or (3) the Fund s Other Operating Expenses at the time of such Reimbursement Payment exceeds of the Fund s NAV. Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365-day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder servicing fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, management and incentive fees owed to the Adviser, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and interest expense, by the Fund s net assets. Operating Expenses means all of the Fund s operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies. The Fund s obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment shall automatically become a liability of the Fund on the last business day of the applicable calendar month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the applicable month. Effective from the date the Fund broke escrow, which was March 13, 2023, FDS has voluntarily agreed to waive its right to receive any Reimbursement Payment for any Excess Operating Funds incurred in any month prior to a revocation. Any such amounts shall not be considered unreimbursed Expense Payments reimbursable in future months pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. This voluntary arrangement can be terminated at any time, upon thirty days prior written notice to the Fund.

There were affiliated holdings at December 31, 2022. Co-investment Relief The Fund and the Adviser have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits the Fund, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons in negotiated transactions, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to such order, the Fund s Board may establish Board-Established Criteria clearly defining co-investment opportunities in which the Fund will have the opportunity to participate with other public or private affiliated funds that target similar assets. If an investment falls within the Board-Established Criteria, the Adviser must offer an opportunity for the Fund to participate. The Fund may determine to participate or not to participate, depending on whether the Adviser determines that the investment is appropriate for the Fund (e.g., based on investment strategy). The co-investment would generally be allocated to the Fund and the other affiliated funds that target similar assets in accordance with the Adviser s allocation policies and procedures. If the Adviser determines that such investment is not appropriate for the Fund, the investment will not be allocated to the Fund, but the Adviser will be required to report such investment and the rationale for its determination for the Fund to not participate in the investment to the Board at the next quarterly board meeting. Due to Affiliates As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Fund owed and , respectively, to various affiliates for expenses paid including offering costs, professional fees, Board of Trustees fees, Administration Fees, and other general and administrative expenses.

The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at the Fund s discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Fund for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The Fund intends to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act.

For the period March 23, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 there were no distributions. With respect to distributions, the Fund has adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders (other than shareholders residing in certain states that require an opt in plan). As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. Shareholders located in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, as well as those who are clients of certain participating brokers that do not permit automatic enrollment in our distribution reinvestment plan, will automatically receive their distributions in cash unless they elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan and have their cash distributions reinvested in additional Common Shares.

 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Fund s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 The Fund s management, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Treasurer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Fund s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC.

 Communications with Trustees 
 Shareholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of the Board by mail. To communicate with the Board, any individual Trustees or any group or committee of Trustees, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or any such individual Trustees or group or committee of Trustees by either name or title. All such correspondence should be sent to Fidelity Private Credit Fund, c/o Fidelity Investments, 245 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. 
 Code of Ethics 
 We and the Adviser have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code are permitted to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code s requirements. 
 Committee of the Board 
 Our Board currently has one committee: an audit committee. We do not have a compensation committee because our executive officers do not receive any direct compensation from us. We also do not have a nominating committee; such matters are considered by the full Board, including the Independent Trustees, or, when applicable, by only the Independent Trustees. The Board will consider nominees for Trustees recommended by shareholders. Recommendations should be submitted to the Independent Trustees in care of the Secretary of the Fund. 
 Audit Committee 
 The audit committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by the Board. The charter sets forth the responsibilities of the audit committee. The primary function of the audit committee is to serve as an independent and objective party to assist the Board in selecting, engaging and discharging our independent accountants, reviewing the plans, scope and results of audit engagements with our independent accountants, approving professional services provided by our independent accountants (including compensation therefore), reviewing the independence of our independent accountants and reviewing the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting. The audit committee is presently composed of three persons including Jennifer Birmingham, Matthew Conti and Tara Kenney, all of whom are considered independent for purposes of the 1940 Act. Jennifer Birmingham serves as the chair of the Audit Committee. Our Board has determined that Jennifer Birmingham qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act. Each of the members of the audit committee meet the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and, in addition, is not an interested person of the Fund or of the Adviser as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. 
 133 

A copy of the charter of the Audit Committee is available in print to any shareholder who requests it, and it will also be available on the Fund s website at fidcredit.com. 
 Board Leadership Structure 
 Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Among other things, our Board sets broad policies for us, approves the appointment of our investment adviser, administrator and officers, and has oversight of the valuation process used to establish the Fund s NAV. The role of our Board, and of any individual Trustees, is one of oversight and not of management of our day-to-day affairs. 
 Under our bylaws, our Board may designate one of our Trustees as chair to preside over meetings of our Board and meetings of shareholders, and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by our Board. David B. Jones is an interested person and currently serves as Chairman. The Trustees have determined that an interested Chairman is appropriate and benefits shareholders because an interested Chairman has a personal and professional stake in the quality and continuity of services provided to the Fund. Independent Trustees exercise their informed business judgment to appoint an individual of their choosing to serve as Chairman, regardless of whether the Trustee happens to be independent or a member of management. The Independent Trustees have determined that they can act independently and effectively without having an Independent Trustee serve as Chairman and that a key structural component for assuring that they are in a position to do so is for the Independent Trustees to constitute a substantial majority for the Board. The Independent Trustees also regularly meet in executive session. 
 Fidelity funds are overseen by different Boards of Trustees. Our Board oversees the Fund and certain Fidelity s alternative investment funds. Other Boards oversee Fidelity s investment-grade bond, money market, asset allocation, high income and equity funds. The use of separate Boards, each with its own committee structure, allows the Trustees of each group of Fidelity funds to focus on the unique issues of the funds they oversee, including common research, investment, and operational issues. On occasion, the separate Boards establish joint committees to address issues of overlapping consequences for the Fidelity funds overseen by each Board. 
 Board Role in Risk Oversight 
 The Fund s Board believes that, collectively, the Trustees have balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, which allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Fund and protecting the interests of shareholders. 
 The Board performs its risk oversight function primarily through (i) its Audit Committee, which reports to the entire Board and is comprised solely of Independent Trustees, and (ii) active monitoring by our CCO and our compliance policies and procedures. 
 Oversight of our investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by the Adviser as part of its day-to-day management of our investment activities. The Board anticipates reviewing risk management processes at both regular and special board meetings throughout the year, consulting with appropriate representatives of the Adviser as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or presentations. The goal of the Board s risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks associated with our investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly addressed. Investors should note, however, that the Board s oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value of investments. 
 We believe that the role of our Board in risk oversight is generally effective and appropriate given the extensive regulation to which we are subject as a BDC. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements that control the levels of risk in our business and operations. For example, we are limited in our ability to enter into certain transactions with our affiliates, including investing in any portfolio company in which one of our affiliates currently has an investment. 
 Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 
 Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Fund s executive officers and trustees, and any persons holding more than 10 of the Fund s shares, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Fund is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based on the Fund s review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by such persons and information provided by the Fund s executive officers and trustees, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, all section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons were timely filed.

Co-Investment Relief 
 We and the Adviser have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons in negotiated transactions, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to such order, the Fund s Board may establish Board-Established Criteria clearly defining co-investment opportunities in which the Fund will have the opportunity to participate with other public or private affiliated funds that target similar assets. If an investment falls within the Board-Established Criteria, the Adviser must offer an opportunity for the Fund to participate. We may determine to participate or not to participate, depending on whether the Adviser determines that the investment is appropriate for the Fund e.g. , based on investment strategy). The co-investment would generally be allocated to us and the other affiliated funds that target similar assets in accordance with the Adviser s allocation policies and procedures described above. If the Adviser determines that such investment is not appropriate for us, the investment will not be allocated to us, but the Adviser will be required to report such investment and the rationale for its determination for us to not participate in the investment to the Board at the next quarterly board meeting. 
 Transactions with Promoters and Certain Control Persons

The Administrator, for its services to us, are entitled to receive reimbursement of certain expenses. In addition, under the Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law and in the discretion of the Fund s Board, we have indemnified the Adviser and the Administrator and certain of their affiliates. See Item 1. Business .

 Aggregate Non-Audit Fees 
 No non-audit fees were billed to the Adviser and service affiliates by Deloitte Touche LLP for non-audit services for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. This includes any non-audit services required to be pre-approved or non-audit services that did not require pre-approval since they did not directly relate to the Fund s operations or financial reporting. 
 Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Provided to the Fund 
 As part of this responsibility, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services performed by the Fund s independent auditor (the Independent Auditor in order to assure that the performance of these services does not impair the auditor s independence from the Fund. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures, which sets forth the conditions and procedures governing the pre-approval services that the Independent Auditor proposes to provide. 
 Annual Approval 
 On an annual basis, at the time of the appointment of the Fund s Independent Auditor and such other times as determined by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee will consider and approve the services (including audit, audit-related, tax and all other services) that the Independent Auditor may initiate. Summary descriptions of the types of services the Audit Committee believes are appropriate for annual approval are provided in accordance with adopted policies and procedures. In addition, in connection with the annual pre-approval of services, the Audit Committee will supplementally review and approve a detailed presentation that sets forth the types of audit, audit-related, tax and other services proposed to be provided by the Independent Auditor, which shall include estimates of the fees for such services. The Audit Committee may periodically revise the list of pre-approved services based on subsequent determinations. 
 Specific Pre-Approval 
 Specific pre-approval is required for the provision of certain audit services as described in the policies and procedures. In addition, if a service proposed to be performed by the Independent Auditor does not fall within an existing pre-approval, either because it is a new type of service or because provision of the service would cause the Independent Auditor to exceed the maximum dollar amount approved for a particular type of service, the proposed service will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
 139 

De Minimis Exception 
 In the event that the Independent Auditor is inadvertently engaged other than by the Audit Committee for a non-audit service, such engagement will not be a violation of the Audit Committee s Independent Auditor Services Policy if: (i) any and all such services do not aggregate to more than 5 of total revenues paid by the Fund to the Independent Auditor in the fiscal year when services are provided; (ii) the services were not recognized as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; (iii) the services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or one or more designated representatives; and (iv) separate disclosure of the services retroactively approved under this exception is made in accordance with the proxy disclosure rules. 
 The Audit Committee has considered these fees and the nature of the services rendered, and has concluded that they are compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte Touche LLP. The Audit Committee did not approve any of the audit-related, tax, or other non-audit fees described above pursuant to the de minimis exceptions set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) and Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. Deloitte Touche LLP did not provide any audit-related services, tax services or other non-audit services to the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund that the Audit Committee was required to approve pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. The Audit Committee considered whether any provision of non-audit services rendered to the Adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund that were not pre-approved by the Audit Committee because the engagement did not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund is compatible with maintaining Deloitte Touche LLP s independence.

Exhibit 4.1 

 DESCRIPTION OF OUR COMMON SHARES 
 REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES 
 EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 
 The following description is based on relevant portions of Delaware law and on our Declaration of Trust and bylaws. This summary is not necessarily complete, and we refer you to Delaware law, our Declaration of Trust and our bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of our Common Shares is attached as an exhibit. 
 General 
 The terms of the Declaration of Trust authorize an unlimited number of Common Shares of any class, par value 0.01 per share, of which 4,084,372 shares outstanding as of March 18, 2024, and an unlimited number of shares of preferred shares, par value 0.01 per share. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Board may classify or reclassify any unissued Common Shares into one or more classes or series of Common Shares or preferred shares by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, or limitations as to dividends, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of the shares. There is currently no market for our Common Shares, and we can offer no assurances that a market for our shares will develop in the future. We do not intend for the shares offered under this prospectus to be listed on any national securities exchange. There are no outstanding options or warrants to purchase our shares. No shares have been authorized for issuance under any equity compensation plans. Under the terms of our Declaration of Trust, shareholders shall be entitled to the same limited liability extended to shareholders of private Delaware for profit corporations formed under the Delaware General Corporation Law, 8 Del. C. 100, et. seq. Our Declaration of Trust provides that no shareholder shall be liable for any debt, claim, demand, judgment or obligation of any kind of, against or with respect to us by reason of being a shareholder, nor shall any shareholder be subject to any personal liability whatsoever, in tort, contract or otherwise, to any person in connection with the Fund s assets or the affairs of the Fund by reason of being a shareholder. 
 None of our shares are subject to further calls or to assessments, sinking fund provisions, obligations of the Fund or potential liabilities associated with ownership of the security (not including investment risks). In addition, except as may be provided by the Board in setting the terms of any class or series of Common Shares, no shareholder shall be entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with any transaction.

Common Shares 
 Under the terms of our Declaration of Trust, all Common Shares will have equal rights as to voting and, when they are issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Dividends and distributions may be paid to the holders of our Common Shares if, as and when authorized by our Board and declared by us out of funds legally available therefore. Except as may be provided by our Board in setting the terms of classified or reclassified shares, our Common Shares will have no preemptive, exchange, conversion, appraisal or redemption rights and will be freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws or by contract and except that, in order to avoid the possibility that our assets could be treated as plan assets, we may require any person proposing to acquire Common Shares to furnish such information as may be necessary to determine whether such person is a benefit plan investor or a controlling person, restrict or prohibit transfers of such shares or redeem any outstanding shares for such price and on such other terms and conditions as may be determined by or at the direction of the Board. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our Common Shares would be entitled to share pro rata in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred shares, if any preferred shares are 
 1 

outstanding at such time. Subject to the rights of holders of any other class or series of shares, each share of our Common Shares will be entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, including the election of Trustees. Except as may be provided by the Board in setting the terms of classified or reclassified shares, and subject to the express terms of any class or series of preferred shares, the holders of our Common Shares will possess exclusive voting power. There will be no cumulative voting in the election of Trustees. Subject to the special rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred shares to elect Trustees, each Trustee will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast with respect to such Trustee s election except in the case of a contested election (as defined in our bylaws), in which case Trustees will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in the contested election of Trustees. Pursuant to our Declaration of Trust, our Board may amend the bylaws to alter the vote required to elect Trustees. 
 Class S Shares 
 Neither the Fund nor the Managing Dealer will charge an upfront sales load with respect to Class S shares; however, if you purchase Class S shares from certain financial intermediaries, they may directly charge you transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine, provided that they limit such charges to a 3.50 cap on NAV for Class S shares. Class S shares are subject to a minimum initial investment of 2,500. All subsequent purchases of Class S, except for those made under our distribution reinvestment plan, are subject to a minimum investment size of 500 per transaction. The Managing Dealer can waive the initial or subsequent minimum investment at its discretion. 
 We pay the Managing Dealer selling commissions over time as a shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee with respect to our outstanding Class S shares equal to 0.85 per annum of the aggregate NAV of our outstanding Class S shares, including any Class S shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears. The Managing Dealer reallows (pays) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers and will waive shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. In addition to the above payments, the Distribution and Service Plan for Class S specifically recognizes that the Adviser may make payments from its management fee revenue, past profits, or other resources to the Managing Dealer in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of Class S shares and/or shareholder support services. The Adviser, directly or through the Managing Dealer or one or more affiliates, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries that provide those services. Currently the Board of the fund has authorized such payments for Class S. 
 Class D Shares 
 Neither the Fund nor the Managing Dealer will charge an upfront sales load with respect to Class D shares; however, if you purchase Class D shares from certain financial intermediaries, they may directly charge you transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, in such amount as they may determine, provided that they limit such charges to a 1.50 cap on NAV for Class D shares. Class D shares are subject to a minimum initial investment of 2,500. All subsequent purchases of Class D, except for those made under our distribution reinvestment plan, are subject to a minimum investment size of 500 per transaction. The Managing Dealer can waive the initial or subsequent minimum investment at its discretion. 
 We pay the Managing Dealer selling commissions over time as a shareholder servicing fee with respect to our outstanding Class D shares equal to 0.25 per annum of the aggregate NAV of all our outstanding Class D shares, including any Class D shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. The shareholder servicing fees are paid monthly in arrears. The Managing Dealer reallows (pays) all or a portion of the shareholder servicing fees to participating brokers and servicing brokers for ongoing shareholder services performed by such brokers and will waive shareholder servicing fees to the extent a broker is not eligible to receive it for failure to provide such services. 
 Class D shares are generally available for purchase in this offering only (1) through fee-based programs, also known as wrap accounts, sponsored by participating brokers or other intermediaries that provide access to Class D shares, (2) through participating brokers that have alternative fee arrangements with their clients to provide access to Class D shares, (3) through transaction/ brokerage platforms at participating brokers, (4) through certain registered investment advisers, (5) through bank trust departments or any other organization or person authorized to act in a fiduciary capacity for its clients or customers or (6) by other categories of investors that we name in an amendment or supplement to this prospectus. 
 2 

In addition to the above payments, the Distribution and Service Plan for Class D specifically recognizes that the Adviser may make payments from its management fee revenue, past profits, or other resources to the Managing Dealer in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of Class D shares and/or shareholder support services. The Adviser, directly or through the Managing Dealer or one or more affiliates, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries that provide those services. Currently the Board of the fund has authorized such payments for Class D. 
 Class I Shares 
 No upfront selling commissions are paid for sales of any Class I shares. Class I shares are subject to a minimum initial investment of 1,000,000, which is waived or reduced by the Managing Dealer to 25,000 or less for certain investors as described below and may be increased or decreased pursuant to agreements with financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries may be permitted to impose higher or lower investment minimums for purchases made through their platforms. Investors should consult their financial intermediary for more information. All subsequent purchases of Class I, except for those made under our distribution reinvestment plan, are subject to a minimum investment size of 500 per transaction. The Managing Dealer can waive the initial or subsequent minimum investment at its discretion. 
 No shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid for sales of any Class I shares. However, Class I has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act that recognizes that the Adviser may make payments from its management fee revenue, past profits, or other resources to the Managing Dealer in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of Class I shares and/or shareholder support services. The Adviser, directly or through the Managing Dealer or one or more affiliates, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries that provide those services. Currently the Board of the fund has authorized such payments for Class I. 
 Class I shares are generally available for purchase in this offering only (1) through fee-based programs, also known as wrap accounts, sponsored by participating brokers or other intermediaries that provide access to Class I shares, (2) by endowments foundations, pension funds and other institutional investors, (3) through participating brokers that have alternative fee arrangements with their clients to provide access to Class I shares, (4) through transaction/ brokerage platforms at participating brokers, (5) by our executive officers and Trustees and their immediate family members, as well as officers and employees of the Adviser or other affiliates and their immediate family members, and, if approved by our Board, joint venture partners, consultants and other service providers, or (6) by other categories of investors that we name in an amendment or supplement to this prospectus. In certain cases, where a holder of Class S or Class D shares exits a relationship with a participating broker for this offering and does not enter into a new relationship with a participating broker for this offering, such holder s shares may be exchanged into an equivalent NAV amount of Class I shares. We may also offer Class I shares to certain feeder vehicles primarily created to hold our Class I shares, which in turn offer interests in themselves to investors; we expect to conduct such offerings pursuant to exceptions to registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and not as a part of this offering. Such feeder vehicles may have additional costs and expenses, which would be disclosed in connection with the offering of their interests. We may also offer Class I shares to other investment vehicles. 
 Without limiting the foregoing, the Managing Dealer waives or reduces to 25,000 or less Class I investment minimums for purchases: (1) through fee-based programs, also known as wrap accounts, sponsored by participating brokers or other intermediaries that provide access to Class I shares, (2) through participating brokers that have alternative fee arrangements with their clients to provide access to Class I shares, (3) through transaction/brokerage platforms at participating brokers, (4) by our executive officers and Trustees and their immediate family members, as well as officers and employees of the Adviser or other affiliates and their immediate family members, and, if approved by our Board, joint venture partners, consultants and other service providers, and (5) by other categories of investors that we name in an amendment or supplement to this prospectus. The foregoing categories of investors who are granted waivers or reductions by the Managing Dealer from the Class I investment minimums include investors described in the foregoing sentence who make purchases for eligible retirement plans and IRAs. Waivers and reductions are subject to the terms and conditions of agreements that the Managing Dealer enters into with participating intermediaries, as applicable. 
 Other Terms of Common Shares 
 3 

We will cease paying the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee on the Class S shares and Class D shares on the earlier to occur of the following: (i) a listing of Class I shares, (ii) our merger or consolidation with or into another entity, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or (iii) the date following the completion of the primary portion of this offering on which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources in connection with this offering, including the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee and other underwriting compensation, is equal to 10 of the gross proceeds from our primary offering. In addition, as required by exemptive relief for which we have applied to allow us to offer multiple classes of shares, at the end of the month in which the Managing Dealer in conjunction with the transfer agent determines that total transaction or other fees, including upfront placement fees or brokerage commissions, and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees paid with respect to any single share held in a shareholder s account would exceed, in the aggregate, 10 of the gross proceeds from the sale of such share (or a lower limit as determined by the Managing Dealer or the applicable selling agent), we will cease paying the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee on either (i) each such share that would exceed such limit or (ii) all Class S shares and Class D shares in such shareholder s account. We may modify this requirement if permitted by applicable exemptive relief. At the end of such month, the applicable Class S shares or Class D shares in such shareholder s account will convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares), with an equivalent aggregate NAV as such Class S or Class D shares. In addition, immediately before any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each Class S share and Class D share will automatically convert into a number of Class I shares (including any fractional shares) with an equivalent NAV as such share. 
 Limitation on Liability of Trustees and Officers; Indemnification and Advance of Expenses 
 Delaware law permits a Delaware statutory trust to include in its declaration of trust a provision to indemnify and hold harmless any trustee or beneficial owner or other person from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever. Our Declaration of Trust provides that our Trustees will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a trustee to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our Declaration of Trust provides for the indemnification of any person to the full extent permitted, and in the manner provided, by Delaware law. In accordance with the 1940 Act, we will not indemnify certain persons for any liability to which such persons would be subject by reason of such person s willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office. 
 Pursuant to our Declaration of Trust and subject to certain exceptions described therein, we will indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to (i) any individual who is a present or former Trustee or officer of the Fund and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or (ii) any individual who, while a Trustee or officer of the Fund and at the request of the Fund, serves or has served as a trustee, officer, partner or trustee of any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity (each such person, an Indemnitee ), in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not provide indemnification for any loss, liability or expense arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws by an Indemnitee unless (i) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations, (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the Indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should be made and the court considering the request for indemnification has been advised of the position of the SEC and of the published position of any state securities regulatory authority in which securities were offered or sold as to indemnification for violations of securities laws. 
 We will not indemnify an Indemnitee against any liability or loss suffered by such Indemnitee unless (i) the Fund determines in good faith that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in the best interest of the Fund, (ii) the Indemnitee was acting on behalf of or performing services for the Fund, (iii) such liability or loss was not the result of (A) negligence or misconduct, in the case that the party seeking indemnification is a Trustee (other than an Independent Trustee), officer, employee, controlling person or agent of the Fund, or (B) gross negligence or willful misconduct, in the case that the party seeking indemnification is an Independent Trustee, and (iv) such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of assets of the Fund and not from the shareholders. 
 4 

In addition, the Declaration of Trust permits the Fund to advance reasonable expenses to an Indemnitee, and we will do so in advance of final disposition of a proceeding (a) if the proceeding relates to acts or omissions with respect to the performance of duties or services on behalf of the Fund, (b) the legal proceeding was initiated by a third party who is not a shareholder or, if by a shareholder of the Fund acting in his or her capacity as such, a court of competent jurisdiction approves such advancement and (c) upon the Fund s receipt of (i) a written affirmation by the trustee or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Fund and (ii) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Fund, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met. 
 Delaware Law and Certain Declaration of Trust Provisions 
 Organization and Duration 
 We were formed in Delaware on March 23, 2022 and will remain in existence until dissolved in accordance with our Declaration of Trust or pursuant to Delaware law. 
 Purpose 
 Under the Declaration of Trust, we are permitted to engage in any business activity that lawfully may be conducted by a statutory trust organized under Delaware law and, in connection therewith, to exercise all of the rights and powers conferred upon us pursuant to the agreements relating to such business activity. 
 Our Declaration of Trust contains provisions that could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. Our Board may, without shareholder action, authorize the issuance of shares in one or more classes or series, including preferred shares; our Board may, without shareholder action, amend our Declaration of Trust to increase the number of our Common Shares, of any class or series, that we will have authority to issue; and our Declaration of Trust provides that, while we do not intend to list our shares on any securities exchange, if any class of our shares is listed on a national securities exchange, our Board will be divided into three classes of Trustees serving staggered terms of three years each. These provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our Board. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms. 
 Sales and Leases to the Fund 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that, unless otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act or applicable guidance or exemptive relief of the SEC, except as otherwise permitted under the 1940 Act, we may not purchase or lease assets in which the Adviser or any of its affiliates have an interest unless all of the following conditions are met: (a) the transaction is fully disclosed to the shareholders in a prospectus or in a periodic report; and (b) the assets are sold or leased upon terms that are reasonable and fair to us and at a price not to exceed the lesser of cost or fair market value as determined by an independent expert. However, the Adviser may purchase assets in its own name (and assume loans in connection therewith) and temporarily hold title, for the purposes of facilitating the acquisition of the assets, the borrowing of money, obtaining financing for us, or the completion of construction of the assets, so long as all of the following conditions are met: (i) the assets are purchased by us at a price no greater than the cost of the assets to the Adviser; (ii) all income generated by, and the expenses associated with, the assets so acquired will be treated as belonging to us; and (iii) there are no other benefits arising out of such transaction to the Adviser apart from compensation otherwise permitted by the Omnibus Guidelines, as adopted by the North American Securities Administrators Association. 
 Sales and Leases to our Adviser, Trustees or Affiliates 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that, unless otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act or applicable guidance or exemptive relief of the SEC, we may not sell assets to the Adviser or any of its affiliates unless such sale is approved by the holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Shares. Our Declaration of Trust also provides that we may not lease assets to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof unless all of the following conditions are met: (a) the transaction 
 5 

is fully disclosed to the shareholders in a prospectus or in a periodic report; and (b) the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable to us. 
 Loans 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that, unless otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act or applicable guidance or exemptive relief of the SEC, except for the advancement of indemnification funds, no loans, credit facilities, credit agreements or otherwise may be made by us to the Adviser or any of its affiliates. 
 Commissions on Financing, Refinancing or Reinvestment 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that, unless otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act or applicable guidance or exemptive relief of the SEC, we generally may not pay, directly or indirectly, a commission or fee to the Adviser or any of its affiliates in connection with the reinvestment of cash available for distribution, available reserves, or the proceeds of the resale, exchange or refinancing of assets. 
 Lending Practices 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that, with respect to financing made available to us by the Adviser, the Adviser may not receive interest in excess of the lesser of the Adviser s cost of funds or the amounts that would be charged by unrelated lending institutions on comparable loans for the same purpose. The Adviser may not impose a prepayment charge or penalty in connection with such financing and the Adviser may not receive points or other financing charges. 
 Number of Trustees; Vacancies; Removal 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that the number of Trustees will be set by our Board in accordance with our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire Board may at any time increase or decrease the number of Trustees. Our Declaration of Trust provides that the number of Trustees generally may not be less than three. Except as otherwise required by applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and as may be provided by our Board in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred shares, pursuant to an election under our Declaration of Trust, any and all vacancies on our Board may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Trustees in office, even if the remaining Trustees do not constitute a quorum, and any Trustee elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the Trustee for whom the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualified, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Independent Trustees will nominate replacements for any vacancies among the Independent Trustees positions. 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that a Trustee may be removed without cause upon the vote of a majority of then-outstanding shares. 
 We have a total of four members of our Board, three of whom are Independent Trustees. Our Declaration of Trust provides that a majority of our Board must be Independent Trustees except for a period of up to 60 days after the death, removal or resignation of an Independent Trustee pending the election of his or her successor. Each Trustee will hold office until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. While we do not intend to list our shares on any securities exchange, if any class of our shares is listed on a national securities exchange, our Board will be divided into three classes of Trustees serving staggered terms of three years each. 
 Action by Shareholders 
 Our bylaws provide that shareholder action can be taken at an annual meeting of shareholders held to consider such matters as may appropriately come before such meeting, at a special meeting of shareholders, or by unanimous consent in lieu of a meeting. The shareholders will only have voting rights as required by the 1940 Act or as otherwise provided for in the Declaration of Trust. Under our Declaration of Trust and bylaws, the Fund holds annual meetings of shareholders to consider such matters as may appropriately come before such meeting. Special meetings of shareholders may be called in the manner provided in the bylaws, including by a majority of the Independent Trustees or the President, and will be limited to the purposes for any such special meeting set forth in the notice thereof. In addition, our Declaration of Trust provides that, subject to the satisfaction of certain procedural and informational 
 6 

requirements by the shareholders requesting the meeting, a special meeting of shareholders will be called by the secretary of the Fund to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of shareholders upon the written request of shareholders entitled to cast not less than 10 of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting. Notice of any special meeting called by such shareholders will be sent to all shareholders within 10 days of the receipt of the written request and the special meeting will be held at the time and place specified in the shareholder request not less than 15 days nor more than 60 days after we are provided notice by such shareholders of the request for a special meeting; provided, however, that if no time or place is so specified in the shareholder request, at such time and place convenient to the shareholder. If there are no Trustees, the officers of the Fund will promptly call a special meeting of the shareholders entitled to vote for the election of successor Trustees. Any meeting may be adjourned and reconvened as the Board may determine or as otherwise provided in the bylaws. These provisions will have the effect of significantly reducing the ability of shareholders being able to have proposals considered at a meeting of shareholders. 
 With respect to special meetings of shareholders, only the business specified in our notice of the meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board at a special meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by the Board or (3) provided that the Board has determined that Trustees will be elected at the meeting, by a shareholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the Declaration of Trust. 
 Our Declaration of Trust also provides that the following actions may be taken by the shareholders, without concurrence by our Board or the Adviser, upon a vote by the holders of more than 50 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to: 
 modify the Declaration of Trust; 

remove the Adviser or appoint a new investment adviser; 

dissolve the Fund; or 

sell all or substantially all of our assets other than in the ordinary course of business. 

The purpose of requiring shareholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our Board a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of any other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by our Board, to inform shareholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of shareholders. Although our Declaration of Trust does not give our Board any power to disapprove shareholder nominations for the election of Trustees or proposals recommending certain action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of Trustees or the consideration of shareholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of trustees or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our shareholders. 
 Our Adviser may not, without the approval of a vote by the holders of more than 50 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such matters: 
 amend the Declaration of Trust; 

amend the Advisory Agreement except for amendments that would not adversely affect the rights of our shareholders; 

except as otherwise permitted under the Advisory Agreement, voluntarily withdraw as our investment adviser unless such withdrawal would not affect our tax status and would not materially adversely affect our shareholders; 

appoint a new investment adviser (other than a sub-adviser pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement and applicable law); 

7 

sell all or substantially all of our assets other than in the ordinary course of business; or 

cause the merger or similar reorganization of the Fund. 

Amendment of the Declaration of Trust and Bylaws 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that shareholders are entitled to vote upon a proposed amendment to the Declaration of Trust if the amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares held by such shareholders so as to affect them adversely. Approval of any such amendment requires at least a majority of the votes cast by such shareholders at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present. In addition, amendments to our Declaration of Trust to make our Common Shares a redeemable security or to convert the Fund, whether by merger or otherwise, from a closed-end company to an open-end company each must be approved by (a) the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter and (b) the affirmative vote of shareholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter upon and following the occurrence of a listing of any class of our shares on a national securities exchange. 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that our Board has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws. Except as described above and for certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust relating to shareholder voting and the removal of Trustees, our Declaration of Trust provides that our Board may amend our Declaration of Trust without any vote of our shareholders. 
 Actions by the Board Related to Merger, Conversion, Reorganization or Dissolution 
 The Board may, without the approval of holders of our outstanding shares, approve a merger, conversion, consolidation or other reorganization of the Fund, provided that the resulting entity is a business development company under the 1940 Act. The Fund will not permit the Adviser to cause any other form of merger or other reorganization of the Fund without the affirmative vote by the holders of more than fifty percent (50 of the outstanding shares of the Fund entitled to vote on the matter. The Fund may be dissolved at any time, without the approval of holders of our outstanding shares, upon affirmative vote by a majority of the Trustees. 
 Derivative Actions 
 No person, other than a Trustee, who is not a shareholder shall be entitled to bring any derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Fund. No shareholder may maintain a derivative action on behalf of the Fund unless holders of at least ten percent (10 of the outstanding shares join in the bringing of such action. The requirement for ten percent (10 of the outstanding shares to join in a derivative action does not apply to claims arising under the federal and state securities laws. 
 In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3816 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute, a shareholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the Fund only if the following conditions are met: (i) the shareholder or shareholders must make a pre-suit demand upon the Board to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the Board to bring such an action is not likely to succeed; and a demand on the Board shall only be deemed not likely to succeed and therefore excused if a majority of the Board, or a majority of any committee established to consider the merits of such action, is composed of Board who are not Independent Trustees (as that term is defined in the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute); and (ii) unless a demand is not required under clause (i) above, the Board must be afforded a reasonable amount of time to consider such shareholder request and to investigate the basis of such claim; and the Board shall be entitled to retain counsel or other advisers in considering the merits of the request and may require an undertaking by the shareholders making such request to reimburse the Fund for the expense of any such advisers in the event that the Board determine not to bring such action. For purposes of this paragraph, the Board may designate a committee of one or more Trustees to consider a shareholder demand. 
 Exclusive Delaware Jurisdiction 
 Each Trustee, each officer and each person legally or beneficially owning a share or an interest in a share of the Fund (whether through a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing or otherwise), to the fullest extent permitted by law, including Section 3804(e) of the Delaware Statutory 
 8 

Trust Statute, (i) irrevocably agrees that any claims, suits, actions or proceedings asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs (or similar) doctrine or arising out of or relating in any way to the Fund, the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute or the Declaration of Trust (including, without limitation, any claims, suits, actions or proceedings) to interpret, apply or enforce (A) the provisions of the Declaration of Trust, (B) the duties (including fiduciary duties), obligations or liabilities of the Fund to the shareholders or the Board, or of officers or the Board to the Fund, to the shareholders or each other, (C) the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the Fund, the officers, the Board or the shareholders, (D) any provision of the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute or other laws of the State of Delaware pertaining to trusts made applicable to the Fund pursuant to Section 3809 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute or (E) any other instrument, document, agreement or certificate contemplated by any provision of the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute or the Declaration of Trust relating in any way to the Fund (regardless, in each case, of whether such claims, suits, actions or proceedings (x) sound in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, (y) are based on common law, statutory, equitable, legal or other grounds or (z) are derivative or direct claims), shall be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court in the State of Delaware with subject matter jurisdiction, (ii) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in connection with any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, (iii) irrevocably agrees not to, and waives any right to, assert in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding that (A) it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts or any other court to which proceedings in such courts may be appealed, (B) such claim, suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or (C) the venue of such claim, suit, action or proceeding is improper, (iv) consents to process being served in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding by mailing, certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy thereof to such party at the address in effect for notices hereunder, and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof; provided, nothing in clause (iv) hereof shall affect or limit any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law and (v) irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding. Nothing disclosed in this section will apply to any claims, suits, actions or proceedings asserting a claim brought under federal securities laws or state securities laws. 
 Restrictions on Roll-Up Transactions 
 In connection with a proposed roll-up transaction, which, in general terms, is any transaction involving the acquisition, merger, conversion or consolidation, directly or indirectly, of us and the issuance of securities of an entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction, we will obtain an appraisal of all of our properties from an independent expert. In order to qualify as an independent expert for this purpose, the person or entity must have no material current or prior business or personal relationship with us and must be engaged to a substantial extent in the business of rendering opinions regarding the value of assets of the type held by us, who is qualified to perform such work. Our assets will be appraised on a consistent basis, and the appraisal will be based on the evaluation of all relevant information and will indicate the value of our assets as of a date immediately prior to the announcement of the proposed roll-up transaction. The appraisal will assume an orderly liquidation of our assets over a 12-month period. The terms of the engagement of such independent expert will clearly state that the engagement is for our benefit and the benefit of our shareholders. We will include a summary of the appraisal, indicating all material assumptions underlying the appraisal, in a report to the shareholders in connection with the proposed roll-up transaction. If the appraisal will be included in a prospectus used to offer the securities of the roll-up entity, the appraisal will be filed with the SEC and the states as an exhibit to the registration statement for the offering. 
 In connection with a proposed roll-up transaction, the person sponsoring the roll-up transaction must offer to the shareholders who vote against the proposal a choice of: 
 accepting the securities of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction offered in the proposed roll-up transaction; or 

one of the following: 

o remaining as shareholders and preserving their interests in us on the same terms and conditions as existed previously; or 

o receiving cash in an amount equal to their pro rata share of the appraised value of our net assets. 

We are prohibited from participating in any proposed roll-up transaction: 
 9 

which would result in shareholders having voting rights in the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction that are less than those provided in the charter, including rights with respect to the election and removal of Trustees, annual and special meetings, amendments to the charter and our dissolution; 

which includes provisions that would operate as a material impediment to, or frustration of, the accumulation of Common Shares by any purchaser of the securities of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction, except to the minimum extent necessary to preserve the tax status of such entity, or which would limit the ability of an investor to exercise the voting rights of its securities of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction on the basis of the number of shares held by that investor; 

in which shareholders rights to access to records of the entity that would be created or would survive after the successful completion of the roll-up transaction will be less than those provided in the charter; 

in which we would bear any of the costs of the roll-up transaction if the shareholders reject the roll-up transaction; or 

unless the organizational documents of the entity that would survive the roll-up transaction provide that neither its adviser nor its managing dealer may vote or consent on matters submitted to its shareholders regarding the removal of its adviser or any transaction between it and its adviser or any of its affiliates. 

Access to Records 
 Any shareholder will be permitted access to all of our records to which they are entitled under applicable law at all reasonable times and may inspect and copy any of them for a reasonable copying charge. Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute, our shareholders are entitled to inspect and copy the following corporate documents: (i) our charter; (ii) our bylaws; (iii) a current list of shareholders; and (iv) information regarding our business and financial condition. A shareholder may also request access to any other corporate records, which may be evaluated solely in the discretion of our Board. Inspection of our records by the office or agency administering the securities laws of a jurisdiction will be provided upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours. An alphabetical list of the names, addresses and business telephone numbers of our shareholders, along with the number of Common Shares held by each of them, will be maintained as part of our books and records and will be available for inspection by any shareholder or the shareholder s designated agent at our office. The shareholder list will be updated at least quarterly to reflect changes in the information contained therein. A copy of the list will be mailed to any shareholder who requests the list within ten days of the request. A shareholder may request a copy of the shareholder list for any proper and legitimate purpose, including, without limitation, in connection with matters relating to voting rights and the exercise of shareholder rights under federal proxy laws. A shareholder requesting a list will be required to pay reasonable costs of postage and duplication. Such copy of the shareholder list shall be printed in alphabetical order, on white paper, and in readily readable type size (no smaller than 10 point font). 
 A shareholder may also request access to any other corporate records. If a proper request for the shareholder list or any other corporate records is not honored, then the requesting shareholder will be entitled to recover certain costs incurred in compelling the production of the list or other requested corporate records as well as actual damages suffered by reason of the refusal or failure to produce the list. However, a shareholder will not have the right to, and we may require a requesting shareholder to represent that it will not, secure the shareholder list or other information for the purpose of selling or using the list for a commercial purpose not related to the requesting shareholder s interest in our affairs. We may also require that such shareholder sign a confidentiality agreement in connection with the request. 
 Reports to Shareholders 
 Within 60 days after each fiscal quarter, we will distribute our quarterly report on Form 10-Q to all shareholders of record. In addition, we will distribute our annual report on Form 10-K to all shareholders within 120 days after the end of each calendar year, which must contain, among other things, a breakdown of the expenses 
 10 

reimbursed by us to the Adviser. These reports will also be available on our website at fidcredit.com and on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov . 
 Subject to availability, you may authorize us to provide prospectuses, prospectus supplements, annual reports and other information, or documents, electronically by so indicating on your subscription agreement, or by sending us instructions in writing in a form acceptable to us to receive such documents electronically. Unless you elect in writing to receive documents electronically, all documents will be provided in paper form by mail. You must have internet access to use electronic delivery. While we impose no additional charge for this service, there may be potential costs associated with electronic delivery, such as on-line charges. If our e-mail notification is returned to us as undeliverable, we will contact you to obtain your updated e-mail address. If we are unable to obtain a valid e-mail address for you, we will resume sending a paper copy by regular U.S. mail to your address of record. You may revoke your consent for electronic delivery at any time and we will resume sending you a paper copy of all required documents. However, in order for us to be properly notified, your revocation must be given to us a reasonable time before electronic delivery has commenced. We will provide you with paper copies at any time upon request. Such request will not constitute revocation of your consent to receive required documents electronically. If you invest in our shares through a financial adviser or a financial intermediary, such as a broker-dealer, and such adviser or intermediary delivers all or a portion of the reports above, any election with respect to delivery you have made with such financial adviser or intermediary will govern how you receive such reports. 
 Conflict with the 1940 Act 
 Our Declaration of Trust provides that, if and to the extent that any provision of Delaware law, or any provision of our Declaration of Trust conflicts with any provision of the 1940 Act, the applicable provision of the 1940 Act will control.

 SECTION 1.08.	 Interest Rates; Benchmark Notification . The interest rate on a Loan denominated in dollars or an Agreed Foreign Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Section 2.15 2.13 (b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.

A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure at such time of the Issuing Banks (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed 30,000,000 (or such greater amount as may be agreed between the Borrower and the Issuing Banks from time to time), (ii) the aggregate LC Exposure of such Issuing Bank (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed such Issuing Bank s LC Commitment (or such greater amount as may be agreed between the Borrower and such Issuing Bank from time to time, subject to clause (c)(i) above), (iii) the total Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments and the total Revolving Dollar Credit Exposures shall not exceed the aggregate Dollar Commitments, (iv) with respect to each Issuing Bank (without duplication), the sum of such Issuing Bank s outstanding Syndicated Loans of a Class, its LC Exposure of such Class, its outstanding Swingline Loans of such Class and its Swingline Exposure of such Class shall not exceed its Commitment of such Class and (v) the total Covered Debt Amount shall not exceed the Borrowing Base then in effect. 
 (d)	 Expiration Date . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any or extension thereof, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date); provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the extension thereof for additional one-year periods; provided further , that (x) in no event shall a Letter of Credit expire after the Commitment Termination Date unless the Borrower (1) deposits Cash, on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date, into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account, an amount equal to 102 of the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit that remain outstanding as of the close of business on the Commitment Termination Date and (2) pays in full, on or prior to the Commitment Termination Date, all commissions required to be paid with respect to any such Letter of Credit through the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit and (y) no Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date after the Maturity Date. 
 (e)	 Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by an Issuing Bank, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Bank or the Lenders, (i) in the case of a Multicurrency Issuing Bank, such Multicurrency Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Multicurrency Lender, and each Multicurrency Lender hereby acquires from such Multicurrency Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and (ii) in the case of a Dollar Issuing Bank, such Dollar Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Dollar Lender, and each Dollar Lender hereby acquires from such Dollar Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any 
 66 

amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the applicable Class of Commitments. 
 In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, (x) each Multicurrency Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Multicurrency Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Multicurrency Issuing Bank and (y) each Dollar Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Dollar Issuing Bank, such Lender s Applicable Dollar Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Dollar Issuing Bank, in each case, promptly upon the request of such Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(f), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. 
 (f)	 Reimbursement . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit issued by it, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time; provided that, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein (other than any minimum amounts, including as set forth in Section 2.02(c)), request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with a Term Benchmark Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month s duration of either Class, an RFR Borrowing, an ABR Borrowing or a Swingline Loan of either Class in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Term Benchmark Borrowing having an Interest Period of one month s duration, an RFR Borrowing, ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan, as applicable. 
 If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each affected Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender s Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage, as applicable, thereof. 
 67 

(g)	 Obligations Absolute . The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower s obligations hereunder. 
 None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks, or any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Banks or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by any Issuing Bank s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that: 
 (i)	the Issuing Banks may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; 
 (ii)	the Issuing Banks shall have the right, in their sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and 
 (iii)	this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Banks when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). 
 (h)	 Disbursement Procedures . Each Issuing Bank shall, within the time allowed pursuant to the Letter of Credit Documents following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by such 
 68 

Issuing Bank. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telecopy or e-mail of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
 (i)	 Interim Interest . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Term Benchmark Loans having an Interest Period of one month s duration (or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Sterling, the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency); provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement within two Business Days following the date when due pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section, then the provisions of Section 2.12(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. 
 (j)	 Replacement of Issuing Banks . Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Lenders of any such replacement of any Issuing Bank. In addition, if any Issuing Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, assigns all of its Loans and Commitments in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such Issuing Bank may, with the prior written consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j), or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing), resign as an Issuing Bank hereunder upon not less than three Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, provided further , in determining whether to give any such consent, the Borrower may consider, among other factors, the sufficiency of availability of Letters of Credit hereunder. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all its unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term Issuing Bank and/or Issuing Banks shall be deemed to refer to such successor or successors (and the other current Issuing Banks, if applicable) or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor or successors (and all other current Issuing Banks) and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of any Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
 69 

(k)	 Cash Collateralization . If the Borrower shall be required to provide cover for its LC Exposure of a Class pursuant to Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d), Section 2.10(e) or the last paragraph of Article VII, the Borrower shall promptly deposit into a segregated collateral account or accounts (herein, collectively, the Letter of Credit Collateral Account in the name and under the dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, Cash denominated in the Currency of the Letter of Credit under which such LC Exposure arises in an amount equal to the amount required under Section 2.09(a), Section 2.10(c), Section 2.10(d), Section 2.10(e) or the last paragraph of Article VII, as applicable. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral in the first instance for its LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the Secured Obligations, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the Letter of Credit Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property held therein. If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii), such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as set forth in this Section 2.05(k)) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures would not exceed the aggregate Commitments. 
 (l)	 Designation of Additional Issuing Banks . The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), designate as additional Issuing Banks one (1) or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of an appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such designated Lender and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein or therein to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an issuer of Letters of Credit hereunder. 
 SECTION 2.06.	 Funding of Borrowings . 
 (a)	 Funding by Lenders . Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(f) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank. 
 (b)	 Presumption by the Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that 
 70 

such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in the corresponding Currency with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the NYFRB Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Term Benchmark Loans having an Interest Period of one month s duration made to the Borrower (or, if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Sterling, the rate per annum then applicable to RFR Loans for the applicable Currency). If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve any Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder, and shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 SECTION 2.07.	 Interest Elections .

Thereafter the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as provided in this Section; provided , however , that (i) a Borrowing of a Class may only be continued or converted into a Borrowing of the same Class, (ii) a Borrowing denominated in one Currency may not be continued as, or converted into, a Borrowing in a different Currency, (iii) no Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may be continued if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments, and (iv) a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be converted into a Borrowing of a different Type. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders of the respective Class holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall thereafter be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loan Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. 
 (b)	 Notice of Elections . To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by delivery of a signed Interest Election Request or by e-mail by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such e-mail Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or e-mail to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower. 
 71 

(c)	 Content of Interest Election Requests . Each Interest Election Request (whether a written Interest Election Request or an e-mail request) shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

 (ii)	the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; 
 (iii)	in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and 
 (iv)	if the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term Interest Period and permitted under Section 2.02(d). 
 (d)	 Notice by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders . Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
 (e)	 Failure to Elect; Events of Default . If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, (i) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a Term Benchmark Borrowing of the same Class having an Interest Period of one month s duration, and (ii) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as such Event of Default is continuing no outstanding Term Benchmark Borrowing may have an Interest Period of more than one month s duration. 
 SECTION 2.08.	 Termination, Reduction or Increase of the Commitments . 
 (a)	 Scheduled Termination . Unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Commitments of each Class shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date.

 72 

effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans of any Class in accordance with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Commitments of such Class. 
 (c)	 Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction . The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided that any such notice of termination or reduction of the Commitments of a Class may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other events, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

Each termination or reduction of Commitments of a Class made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 shall (i) be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class and (ii) result in a permanent termination of Commitments in an amount equal to the Commitments so terminated or reduced. Each Lender authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to, concurrently with and immediately after the effectiveness of any termination or reduction of Commitments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08, amend Schedule I to reflect the aggregate amount of each Lender s aggregate Commitments.

 (v)	 Terms of Loans Issued on the Commitment Increase Date . The terms and provisions of any new Loans issued by any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, and the Commitment Increase of any Assuming Lender or Increasing Lender, shall be identical to the terms and provisions of Loans issued by, and Commitments of, the Lenders immediately prior to the applicable Commitment Increase Date (except that any upfront or similar one-time fee may be different). 
 SECTION 2.09.	 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt . 
 (a)	 Repayment . The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay the Loans of each Class as follows: 
 (i)	 to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders the outstanding principal amount of each Class of Loans and all other amounts due and owing hereunder and under the other Loan Documents on the Maturity Date;

(iii)	 to the applicable Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan of such Class made by such Swingline Lender denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, on the earlier of the (A) Maturity Date and (B)(1) in the case of any Swingline Loan denominated in GBP, the fourth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made or (2) for any other Swingline Loan denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, the fifth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a Syndicated Borrowing of such Class is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans of such Class then outstanding. 
 In addition, on the Maturity Date, to the extent any Letter of Credit is outstanding (notwithstanding the requirements of clause (y) of the second proviso of Section 2.05(d)), the Borrower shall deposit into the Letter of Credit Collateral Account Cash an amount equal to 102 of the undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding on the close of business on the Maturity Date, such deposit to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for the LC Exposure under this Agreement in respect of the undrawn portion of such Letters of Credit. 
 (b)	 Manner of Payment . Subject to Section 2.10(e), prior to any repayment or prepayment of any Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telecopy or e-mail of such selection not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment. If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the Class to be repaid or prepaid is specified (or if no Class is specified and there is only one Class of Loans with Borrowings denominated in Dollars outstanding), the Borrower shall repay or prepay any outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class pro rata and thereafter repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings within such Class in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first). If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in Dollars and the Class to be repaid or prepaid is not specified, the Borrower shall repay or prepay pro rata between any outstanding ABR Borrowings of the Dollar Lenders and the Multicurrency Lenders, and thereafter repay or prepay the remaining Borrowings denominated in Dollars in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowings with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first). If the repayment or prepayment is denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency (including as a result of the Borrower s receipt of proceeds from a prepayment event in such Agreed Foreign Currency), the Borrower may, at its option, repay or prepay any outstanding Borrowings in such Currency ratably among just the Multicurrency Lenders in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first), and, if after such payment, the balance of the Borrowings denominated in such Currency is zero, then if there are any remaining proceeds, the Borrower shall repay or prepay the Loans (or provide cover for outstanding Letters of Credit as contemplated by Section 2.05(k)) on a pro-rata basis between each outstanding Class of Revolving Credit Exposure in the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid or prepaid first). Each payment of a Borrowing of a Class shall be applied ratably to the Loans of such Class included in such Borrowing. 
 (c)	 Maintenance of Records by Lenders . Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such 
 76 

Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts and Currency of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
 (d)	 Maintenance of Records by the Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the amount and Currency of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount and Currency of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender of such Class hereunder and (iii) the amount and Currency of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. 
 (e)	 Effect of Entries . The entries made in the records maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence, absent manifest error, of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. In the event of any conflict between the Register and any other accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.

In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its permitted registered assigns) in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E or in such other form as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its permitted registered assigns).

 (b)	 Mandatory Prepayments Due to Changes in Exchange Rates . 
 (i)	 Determination of Amount Outstanding . On each Revaluation Date, the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure. For the purpose of this determination, the outstanding principal amount of any Loan or LC Exposure that is denominated in any Foreign Currency shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the amount in the Foreign Currency of such Loan or LC Exposure, determined as of such Revaluation Date. Upon making such determination, 
 77 

the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Multicurrency Lenders and the Borrower thereof. 
 (ii)	 Prepayment . If, on such Revaluation Date, the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure minus the Multicurrency LC Exposure fully cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.05(k) on such date exceeds 105 of the aggregate amount of the Multicurrency Commitments as then in effect, the Borrower shall prepay the Swingline Multicurrency Loans and Multicurrency Loans (and/or provide cover for Multicurrency LC Exposure as specified in Section 2.05(k)) within 15 Business Days following receipt of the Administrative Agent s notice after such Revaluation Date in such aggregate amounts, if any, as shall be necessary so that after giving effect thereto and the determination of the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure as of such date the aggregate Revolving Multicurrency Credit Exposure does not exceed the Multicurrency Commitments.

 78 

Borrowing Base Deficiency shall not be a Specified Default or Event of Default hereunder until the expiration of the applicable grace or cure period.

 (ii)	the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders of any affected Class with respect to such Class that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, the AUD Rate, the CDOR Adjusted Term CORRA Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, the EURIBOR Rate or applicable Local Rate for the applicable Currency and such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable Currency and such Interest Period or (B) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for the applicable Currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for the applicable Currency, 
 then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the affected Lenders in writing by e-mail as promptly as practicable thereafter setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03, (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing and any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing shall instead 
 85 

be deemed to be an Interest Election Request or a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not also the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Borrowing if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings also is the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above and (B) for Loans denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing and any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing, in each case, for the relevant Benchmark, shall be ineffective; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted; provided further that, in connection with any ABR Borrowing made pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.13(a), the determination of the Alternate Base Rate shall disregard clause (c) of the definition thereof. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Foreign Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 2.13(a) with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03, (A) for Loans denominated in Dollars, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not also the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Borrowing if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings also is the subject of Section 2.13(a)(i) or (ii) above and, (B) for Loans denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan and (2) any RFR Loan shall immediately, bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency plus the CBR Spread (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin) ; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency shall, at the Borrower s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (B) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan) on such day and (C) any RFR Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency plus the CBR Spread; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency, at the Borrower s election, shall either (i) be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Agreed Foreign Currency) immediately or (ii) be prepaid in full immediately. 
 
 (b)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document (and any Hedging Agreement shall be deemed not to be a Loan Document for purposes of this Section 2.13), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark 
 86 

Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement with respect to Dollars and/or Canadian Dollars for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement with respect to any Currency for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders of each affected Class. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR or Daily Simple CORRA , all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 (c)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document other than as provided in the definition of Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes (provided that the Administrative Agent s determination shall be generally consistent with determinations made for borrowers of syndicated loans in the United States denominated in the applicable Currency). 
 (d)	The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.13, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.13. 
 (e)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or Term CORRA and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other 
 87 

information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of Interest Period for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. 
 (f)	Upon the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, either (x) the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for (1) a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to (A) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) an ABR Borrowing if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) any Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in an Agreed Foreign Currency shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement for such Currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.13, (i) for Loans denominated in Dollars, any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Loan if the Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day or (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is denominated in any Agreed Foreign Currency, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, at the Borrower s election prior to such day: (A) bear interest at the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency plus the Applicable Margin; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate (or in the case of Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate) for the applicable Agreed Foreign Currency cannot be determined, the Borrower may not make an election under this subclause (A), (B) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (C) be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and (subject to the remainder of this subclause (C)) shall constitute, an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Loan) on such day (it being 
 88 

understood and agreed that if the Borrower does not so prepay such Loan on such day by 12:00 noon, Local Time, the Administrative Agent is authorized to effect such conversion of such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, as applicable, into an ABR Loan denominated in Dollars). 
 SECTION 2.14.	 Computation of Interest . All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (a) Term Benchmark Borrowings in Canadian Dollars, AUD shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) and (b) RFR Borrowings, and ABR Borrowings, at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate, shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, EURIBOR Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or Daily Simple RFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 SECTION 2.15.	 Increased Costs . 
 (a)	If any Change in Law shall: 
 (i)	impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, compulsory loan, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate) or any Issuing Bank; or 
 (ii)	impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense, affecting this Agreement or Term Benchmark Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank or participation by such Lender therein; 
 and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost (other than costs which are (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Connection Income Taxes or (C) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes) to such Lender of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Term Benchmark Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost (other than costs which are Taxes) to such Lender or such Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that no Lender will claim the payment of any of the amounts referred to in this paragraph (a) if not generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances. 
 (b)	 Capital Requirements . If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of 
 89 

such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Swingline Loans and in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity requirements), by an amount deemed to be material by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, then, upon the request of such Lender or such Issuing Bank, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in Dollars, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered; provided that no Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, will claim the payment of any of the amounts referred to in this paragraph (b) if not generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances. 
 (c)	 Certificates from Lenders . A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank (x) setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the calculation of the amount or amounts, in Dollars, necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and (y) certifying that such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, is generally claiming similar compensation from its other similar customers in similar circumstances, shall be promptly delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided, however that no Lender shall be requested to disclose confidential or price sensitive information or any other information, to the extent prohibited by applicable law. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
 (d)	 Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
 SECTION 2.16.	 Break Funding Payments . With respect to Term Benchmark Loans, in the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of the occurrence of any Commitment Increase Date or an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term Benchmark Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (including, in connection with any Commitment Increase Date, and regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(g) and is revoked in accordance herewith) or (d) the assignment as a result of a request by the Borrower 
 90 

pursuant to Section 2.20(b) of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each affected Lender for such Lender s loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (excluding loss of anticipated profits). Payments under this Section shall be made upon written request of a Lender delivered to the Borrower not later than 10 Business Days following a payment, conversion, or failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay that gives rise to a claim under this Section accompanied by a written certificate of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and calculation of the amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof. 
 SECTION 2.17.	 Taxes . 
 (a)	 Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) the Borrower shall make such deductions or withholding, (ii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (iii) if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made. 
 (b)	 Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . In addition, the Borrower shall pay, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
 (c)	 Indemnification by the Borrower . The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank for, and within 30 Business Days after written demand therefor, pay the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such recipient and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A written certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (d)	 Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by 
 91 

such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
 (e)	 Foreign Lenders . Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. 
 In addition, any applicable Foreign Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Foreign Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:

 (ii)	duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or any successor form certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, 
 (iii)	in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (1) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (3) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) (or any successor form), or 
 (iv)	any other form including Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY as applicable prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
 92 

(f)	 United States Lenders . Each Lender and each Issuing Bank that is not a Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prior to the date on which such Issuing Bank or such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, and at times reasonably requested by the Borrower, duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or any successor form, certificate or documentation provided it is legally able to do so at the time. 
 (g)	 FATCA . If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (g), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 In addition, each Lender agrees that if any certificate or documentation previously delivered under this Section by such Lender expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect it shall update such certificate or documentation, provided it is legally able to do so at the time. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at any time the chief tax officer of such Lender becomes aware that it no longer satisfies the legal requirements to provide any previously delivered form, certificate or documentation to the Borrower (or any other form, certificate or documentation adopted by the U.S. or other taxing authorities for such purpose). 
 
 (h)	 Treatment of Certain Refunds . If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or an Issuing Bank, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in a 
 93 

less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to make available its tax returns or its books or records (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 (i)	 Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 (j)	 Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section, the term applicable law includes FATCA. 
 SECTION 2.18.	 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs . 
 (a)	 Payments by the Borrower . The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Account, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document and except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All amounts owing under this Agreement (including commitment fees, payments required under Section 2.15, and payments required under Section 2.16 relating to any Loan denominated in Dollars, but not including principal of, and interest on, any Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency or payments relating to any such Loan required under Section 2.16 or any reimbursement or cash collateralization of any LC Exposure denominated in any Foreign Currency, which are payable in such Foreign Currency) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) are payable in Dollars. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or LC Disbursement when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise), the unpaid portion of such Loan or such LC Disbursement shall, if such Loan or such LC Disbursement is not denominated in Dollars, automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date thereof (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent 
 94 

thereof on the date of such redenomination and such principal shall be payable on demand; and if the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or LC Disbursement that is not denominated in Dollars, such interest shall automatically be redenominated in Dollars on the due date therefor (or, if such due date is a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day of such Interest Period) in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof on the date of such redenomination and such interest shall be payable on demand. 
 (b)	 Application of Insufficient Payments . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees of a Class then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees of such Class then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements of such Class then due to such parties. 
 (c)	 Pro Rata Treatment . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing of a Class shall be made from the Lenders of such Class, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders of such Class, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Borrowing of a Class shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the making of Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment of commitment fees under Section 2.11 shall be made for the account of the Lenders pro rata according to the average daily unutilized amounts of their respective Commitments; (iv) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; and (v) each payment of interest on Loans of a Class by the Borrower shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to such Lenders. 
 (d)	 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender of a Class shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, within its Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon of such Class then due than the proportion received by any other Lender of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of such Class; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, 
 95 

without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (d) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (d) shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing, and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower may make a Borrowing under the Dollar Commitments or Multicurrency Commitments (if otherwise permitted hereunder) and may use the proceeds of such Borrowing (x) with Dollar Commitments to prepay the Multicurrency Loans (without making a ratable prepayment of the Dollar Loans) or (y) with Multicurrency Commitments to prepay the Dollar Loans (without making a ratable payment to the Multicurrency Loans). 
 (e)	 Presumptions of Payment . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
 (f)	 Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. 
 SECTION 2.19.	 Defaulting Lenders . 
 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
 (a)	commitment fees pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender to the extent and during the period such Lender is a Defaulting Lender; 
 (b)	the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether two-thirds of the Lenders, two-thirds of the 
 96 

Lenders of a Class, the Required Lenders or the Required Lenders of a Class have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Documents (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders (or all Lenders of a Class) or each affected Lender (if applicable to such Defaulting Lender), including as set forth in Section 9.02(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; 
 (c)	if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
 (i)	all or any part of such Swingline Exposure (other than the portion of such Swingline Exposure consisting of Swingline Loans made by such Defaulting Lender) and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non Defaulting Lenders holding Commitments of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender in accordance with their respective Applicable Multicurrency Percentages or Applicable Dollar Percentages, as applicable, but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Credit Exposures of such Class plus such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Class does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments of such Class and (y) no non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Credit Exposure of such Class will exceed such Lender s Commitment of such Class; 
 (ii)	if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law, within three Business Days following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(k) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; 
 (iii)	if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b) with respect to such LC Exposure during the period such LC Exposure is cash collateralized; 
 (iv)	if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non Defaulting Lenders Applicable Multicurrency Percentages or Applicable Dollar Percentages, as applicable, in effect immediately after giving effect to such reallocation; 
 (v)	if any Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.19(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all commitment fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender s Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.11(b) with respect to such LC Exposure 
 97 

shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and 
 (vi)	no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation; and 
 (d)	so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lenders shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank of the same Class as such Defaulting Lender shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit of such Class, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure will be 100 covered by the Commitments of the non Defaulting Lenders of such Class and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.19(c), and Swingline Exposure related to any newly made Swingline Loan and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders of such Class in a manner consistent with Section 2.19(c)(i) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein). 
 In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Banks (with respect to the Swingline Lenders and any Issuing Bank, only to the extent that such Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank acts in such capacity under the same Class of Commitments held by a Defaulting Lender) each agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then, on the date of such agreement, such Lender shall no longer be deemed a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall no longer be required to cash collateralize any portion of such Lender s LC Exposure cash collateralized pursuant to Section 2.19(c)(ii) above and the Swingline Exposure and the LC Exposure of the Lenders of the affected Class shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Commitment of such Class and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par the portion of the Loans of the other Lenders of such Class (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Multicurrency Percentage or Applicable Dollar Percentage, as applicable, in effect immediately after giving effect to such agreement. 
 SECTION 2.20.	 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 
 (a)	 Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall at the request of the Borrower use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any cost or expense not required to be reimbursed by the Borrower and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 98 

(b)	 Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or is a non-consenting Lender (as provided in Section 9.02(d)), then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 and Section 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts then due and payable), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any assignment as a result of a non-consenting Lender (that the Borrower is permitted to replace as provided in Section 9.02(d)), the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 (c)	 Defaulting Lender . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(e), 2.06 or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
 SECTION 2.21.	 Maximum Rate . 
 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the Charges ), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the Maximum Rate which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all related Charges, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate. To the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of a Loan, but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section, shall be cumulated and the 
 99 

interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

If the Borrower shall fail to determine the value of any Portfolio Investment as at any date pursuant to the requirements (but subject to the exclusions) of the foregoing subclauses (A) through (C), the Value of such Portfolio Investment as at such date shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of the Borrowing Base until such time as the value of such Portfolio Investment is determined in accordance with this Agreement. 
 (E)	 Initial Value of Assets . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the Effective Date until the date when the first valuation reports are required to be delivered under Section 5.01(i), the Value of any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with respect to each 
 117 

Borrower shall be the Value as determined in a manner consistent with Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) and as delivered to the Collateral Agent on or prior to the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(B) the value of any Portfolio Investments determined in accordance with any provision of this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in good faith in accordance with this Section 5.12 
 provided that, the Borrower shall value substantially all Portfolio Investments pursuant to the foregoing requirements no less frequently than once in any rolling twelve-month period. 
 
 (iii)	 Scheduled Testing of Values . 
 (A)	Each February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 of each calendar year, commencing on May 31, 2023 (or such other dates as are agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, but in no event less frequently than once per calendar quarter, each a Valuation Testing Date ), the Administrative Agent through an Independent Valuation Provider will test the values determined, or required to be determined, pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) of those Unquoted Investments (x) included in the Borrowing Base as of such Valuation Testing Date or at any time between such Valuation Testing Date and the immediately preceding Valuation Testing Date, in each case, unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder and (y) selected by the Administrative Agent; provided , that the aggregate value of such Unquoted Investments tested on any Valuation Testing Date will be equal to the Tested Amount (as defined below) (or as near thereto as reasonably practical). For the avoidance of doubt, Unquoted Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date or at any time between the applicable Valuation Testing Date and the immediately preceding Valuation Testing Date (unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder) shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iii). 
 (B)	For purposes of this Agreement, the Tested Amount shall be equal to the greater of: (i) an amount equal to (y) 125 of the Covered Debt Amount (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date) minus (z) the sum of the values of all Cash and all Quoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date) and (ii) 10 of the aggregate value of all Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base (as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date); provided , however , in no event shall more than 25 (or, if clause (ii) applies, 10 , or as near thereto as reasonably practicable) of the aggregate value of the Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base be tested by the Independent Valuation Provider in respect of any applicable Valuation Testing Date. If the Value of the Unquoted Investments included in the Borrowing Base is less than the Tested Amount as calculated in the immediately preceding sentence, then the Tested Amount shall equal the Value of such Unquoted Investments. 
 118 

(C)	With respect to any Unquoted Investment, if the value of such Unquoted Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is not more than the lesser of (1) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percentage of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Unquoted Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par, otherwise this clause (1) shall not be applicable) and (2) 110 of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider, then the value for such Unquoted Investment determined in accordance with Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the Value for purposes of this Agreement. If the value of any Unquoted Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is more than the lesser of the values set forth in clause (C)(1) and (2) (to the extent applicable), then for such Unquoted Investment, the Value for purposes of this Agreement shall become the least of (x) the highest value of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider, (y) five (5) points more than the midpoint of the valuation range (expressed as a percentage of par) provided by the Independent Valuation Provider (provided that the value of such Unquoted Investment is customarily quoted as a percentage of par, otherwise this clause (y) shall not be applicable) and (z) 110 of the midpoint of the valuation range provided by the Independent Valuation Provider; provided that, if a Portfolio Investment is acquired during a fiscal quarter and until such time as the Value is obtained with respect to such Portfolio Investment pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(A), 5.12(b)(ii)(B) or 5.12(b)(iii), the Value of such Portfolio Investment shall be deemed to be equal to the lower of (x) the value of such Portfolio Investment determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii)(C) and (y) the cost of such Unquoted Investment. 
 (iv)	 Supplemental Testing of Values . 
 (A)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent individually or at the request of the Required Lenders, shall, at any time, have the right to request, in its reasonable discretion, any Portfolio Investment included in the Borrowing Base with a value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) to be independently tested by the Independent Valuation Provider. There shall be no limit on the number of such tests that may be requested by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion. If (x) the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is less than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this clause, then the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the Value for purposes of this Agreement and (y) if the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) is greater than the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this clause and the difference between such values is: (1) less than or equal to 5 of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall continue to be used as the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement; (2) greater than 5 and less than or equal to 20 of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the value determined pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii) and the value determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to this clause; and (3) greater than 20 of the value determined 
 119 

pursuant to Section 5.12(b)(ii), then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, shall retain an additional third-party appraiser and, upon the completion of such appraisal, the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement shall become the average of the three (3) valuations (with the average of the Independent Valuation Provider s value and the Borrower s value determined pursuant to this clause to be used as the Value of such Portfolio Investment for a period of up to five (5) Business Days following written notice from the Administrative Agent of the Value determined pursuant to this clause and once such third-party appraiser has been retained and until the earlier of (x) the date such third value is obtained and (y) the immediately subsequent Valuation Testing Date, provided that if such third value is not obtained by the subsequent Valuation Testing Date, the Value of such Portfolio Investment shall be the Independent Valuation Provider s Value until such Portfolio Investment is revalued in accordance with this Section 5.12). For the avoidance of doubt, Portfolio Investments that are part of the Collateral but not included in the Borrowing Base as of the applicable Valuation Testing Date or at any time between the applicable Valuation Testing Date and the immediately preceding Valuation Testing Date (unless such Portfolio Investment is no longer in the Collateral Pool pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder) shall not be subject to testing under this Section 5.12(b)(iv). 
 (B)	Except as otherwise provided herein, the Value of any Portfolio Investment for which the Independent Valuation Provider s value is used shall be the midpoint of the range (if any) determined by the Independent Valuation Provider. The Independent Valuation Provider shall apply a recognized valuation methodology that is commonly accepted by the business development company industry for valuing Portfolio Investments of the type being valued and held by the Obligors. 
 (C)	For the avoidance of doubt, the Value of any Portfolio Investment determined in accordance with this Section 5.12 shall be the Value of such Portfolio Investment for purposes of this Agreement until a new Value for such Portfolio Investment is subsequently determined in accordance with this Section 5.12. 
 (D)	The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of any valuation reasonably incurred by the Administrative Agent, under this Section 5.12 shall be at the expense of the Borrower; provided that the Borrower s obligation to reimburse valuation costs incurred by the Administrative Agent, pursuant to this Section 5.12(b)(iv) shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the greater of (x) 100,000 and (y) 0.015 of the total Commitments for any 12-month period (the IVP Supplemental Cap ). 
 (E)	In addition, the values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider shall be deemed to be Information hereunder and subject to Section 9.13 hereof. 
 120 

(F)	The Administrative Agent shall provide a copy of the final results of any valuation performed by the Independent Valuation Provider or an Approved Third-Party Appraiser to any Lender promptly upon such Lender s request, except to the extent that such recipient has not executed and delivered a customary and reasonable non-reliance letter, confidentiality agreement or similar agreement requested or required by such Independent Valuation Provider or Approved Third-Party Appraiser, as applicable; provided, that without the consent of the Borrower, no final report may be provided by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders prior to the earlier of the date that the Borrower delivers its financial statements for the related period and the date on which the Borrower is required to so deliver such financial statements pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b). 
 (v)	For the avoidance of doubt, any Values determined by the Independent Valuation Provider pursuant to Sections 5.12(b)(iii) and (iv) shall only be required to be used for purposes of calculating the Borrowing Base and shall not be required to be utilized by the Borrower for any other purpose, including, without limitation, the delivery of financial statements or valuations required under ASC 820 or the Investment Company Act. 
 (vi)	The Independent Valuation Provider shall be instructed to conduct its tests in a manner not disruptive in any material respect to the business of the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of its receipt of the final results of any valuation performed by the Independent Valuation Provider promptly upon its receipt thereof and shall provide a copy of such results and the related report to the Borrower promptly upon the Borrower s request. 
 (c)	 Investment Company Diversification Requirements .

The Borrower will at all times, subject to applicable grace or cure periods set forth in the Code, comply with the portfolio diversification and similar requirements set forth in the Code applicable to RICs. 
 (d)	 Participation Interests . The Value attributable to any Participation Interest shall be the Value determined with respect to the underlying portfolio investment related to such Participation Interest in accordance with this Section 5.12, provided any participation interest that does not satisfy the definition of Participation Interest shall have a Value of zero for purposes of this Agreement. 
 
 SECTION 5.13.	 Calculation of Borrowing Base . For purposes of this Agreement, the Borrowing Base shall be determined, as at any date of determination, as the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (x) the Value of each Portfolio Investment in the Collateral Pool to the extent the Borrower elects to include such Portfolio Investment in the Borrowing Base by (y) the applicable Advance Rate, provided that:

 First Lien Bank Loan means a Bank Loan that is entitled to the benefit of a first lien and first-priority perfected security interest (subject to any Permitted Prior Working Capital Lien and other customary encumbrances) on a substantial portion of the assets (subject to customary exceptions) of the respective borrower and guarantors obligated in respect thereof; provided that any First Lien Bank Loan that is also a First Lien Unitranche Bank Loan shall be treated for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate as a First Lien Unitranche Bank Loan; provided further that any First Lien Bank Loan that is also a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan shall be treated for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate as a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan; provided further that any First Lien Bank Loan that is also a Late-Stage Loan shall be treated for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate as a Late-Stage Loan.

An Obligor s investment 
 126 

in the last out portion of a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan shall be treated as a First Lien Last Out Bank Loan for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate for such Portfolio Investment under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Obligor s investment in the portion of such Bank Loan that is not the last out portion (the first out portion) shall be treated as a First Lien Bank Loan for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate for such Portfolio Investment under this Agreement and whether such Portfolio Investment constitutes a Senior Investment under this Agreement, and an Obligor s investment in any last out portion of a First Lien Bank Loan that does not meet the foregoing criteria shall be treated as a Second Lien Bank Loan for purposes of determining the applicable Advance Rate for such Portfolio Investment under this Agreement and whether such Portfolio Investment constitutes a Senior Investment under this Agreement.

The Administrative Agent may resign by providing not less than thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower. Upon any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld (or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in consultation with the Borrower), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent s resignation shall nonetheless become effective at the end of such thirty (30) day period, except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. 
 Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
 Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02(b) with respect to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent may, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders (but not otherwise), consent to any modification, supplement or waiver under any of the Loan Documents; provided that, without the prior consent of each Lender, the Administrative Agent shall not (except as provided herein or in the Security Documents) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under any Security Document providing for collateral security, agree to additional obligations being secured by all or substantially all of such collateral security (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder in accordance with the Guarantee and Security Agreement) , or alter or subordinate the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the benefits of the Liens created under the Security Documents with 
 150 

respect to all or substantially all of the Collateral, except that no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, to (1) release (which such release shall be automatic and require no further action from any party) any Lien covering property that is the subject of either a disposition of property permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented, (2) release from any Guarantee and Security Agreement any Subsidiary Guarantor (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a Designated Subsidiary by the Borrower or becomes an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary in accordance with this Agreement or which is no longer required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor , so long as in the case of this clause (2): (A) immediately after giving effect to any such release and any Concurrent Transactions, the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed the Borrowing Base and the Borrower delivers a certificate of a Financial Officer to such effect to the Administrative Agent, (B) either, immediately after giving effect to any Concurrent Transactions, (I) the amount of any excess availability under the Borrowing Base immediately prior to such release is not diminished as a result of such release or (II) the Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base immediately after giving effect to such release is at least 110 of the Covered Debt Amount and (C) no Specified Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (3) spread Liens to any Designated Indebtedness or Hedging Agreement Obligations (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) in accordance with the Guarantee and Security Agreement and (4) release from any Guarantee and Security Agreement any Obligor (and any property of such Obligor) that is concurrently being joined as an Obligor under the Guarantee and Security Agreement in connection with a transaction permitted hereunder. 
 None of the Lead Arrangers shall have obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder. 
 Each Lender and Issuing Bank hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender or Issuing Bank that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender or Issuing Bank from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a Payment were erroneously transmitted to such Lender or Issuing Bank (whether or not known to such Lender or Issuing Bank), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender or Issuing Bank shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender or Issuing Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received, including without limitation any defense based on discharge for value or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to the foregoing shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 151 

Each Lender and Issuing Bank hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a Payment Notice or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender or Issuing Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. 
 The Borrower and each other Obligor hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not recovered from any Lender or Issuing Bank that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender or Issuing Bank with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Obligor; provided that this paragraph shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the Secured Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Secured Obligations that would have been payable had such erroneous Payment not been made by the Administrative Agent, except, in each case, to the extent such Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Obligor for the purpose of making any payment hereunder. 
 Each party s obligations pursuant to the foregoing shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, an Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 Each of the Administrative Agent and any Lender agree that the obligations assumed by any Obligor hereunder shall be limited in all cases to such Obligor and its assets and none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective agents or assigns shall seek satisfaction of any such obligation from the officers, agents, employees, directors, trustees, managers, members, shareholders or partners of any such Obligor.

The Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.

SECTION 9.02.	 Waivers; Amendments . 
 (a)	 No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative . No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 9.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
 (b)	 Amendments to this Agreement . Subject to Sections 2.15(b), (c) and (d) and Section 9.02(e) below, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, no such agreement shall: 
 (i)	increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, 
 (ii)	reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than with respect to the election of or the failure to elect the default rate in accordance with Section 2.12(d)), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, 
 (iii)	postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, 
 (iv)	change Section 2.18(b), (c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby, 
 (v)	change any of the provisions of this Section 9.02 (b) or the definition of the term Required Lenders or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, 
 156 

(vi)	other than as permitted by this Agreement, the Guarantee and Security Agreement or any other applicable Loan Document, release or subordinate all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien created under the Guarantee and Security Agreement or release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their obligations as Subsidiary Guarantors thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, or 
 (vii)	amend the definition of Applicable Percentage , Applicable Dollar Percentage or Applicable Multicurrency Percentage , without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; 
 provided further that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be and (y) the consent of Lenders holding not less than two-thirds of the holders of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments will be required (A) for any adverse change (from the Lenders perspective) affecting the provisions of this Agreement solely relating to the calculation of the Borrowing Base (excluding changes to the provisions of Section 5.12(b)(iii) or (iv), but including changes to the provisions of Section 5.12(c) and the definitions set forth in Section 5.13) unless otherwise expressly provided herein and (B) for any release of Collateral other than for fair value or as otherwise permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. 
 For purposes of this Section 9.02, the scheduled date of payment of any amount shall refer to the date of payment of such amount specified in this Agreement, and shall not refer to a date or other event specified for the mandatory or optional prepayment of such amount. In addition, whenever a waiver, amendment or modification requires the consent of a Lender affected thereby, such waiver, amendment or modification shall, upon consent of such Lender, become effective as to such Lender whether or not it becomes effective as to any other Lender, so long as the Required Lenders consent to such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above. 
 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver, amendment or modification as provided above; provided , however , in no other circumstances shall the concurrence of the Required Lenders of a particular Class be required for any waiver, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 (c)	 Amendments to Security Documents . Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in the Guarantee and Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents, no Security Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, nor may the Liens granted under the Guarantee and Security Agreement be spread to secure any additional obligations (excluding (x) any increase in the Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder pursuant to a Commitment Increase under Section 2.08(e), (y) any increase in any Other Secured Indebtedness permitted hereunder and (z) the spreading of such Liens to any Designated 
 157 

Indebtedness or Hedging Agreement Obligations (as such terms are defined in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) as provided for in the Guarantee and Security Agreement) except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Collateral Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, except as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan Documents, (i) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the Obligors from their respective obligations under the Security Documents and (ii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, or release all or substantially all of the guarantors under the Guarantee and Security Agreement from their guarantee obligations thereunder, except that, in each case described in clause (i) or (ii), no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower) to direct the Collateral Agent under the Guarantee and Security Agreement (in addition to the rights of such parties under the Guarantee and Security Agreement), to and the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may, (1) release any Lien covering property (and to release any such guarantor) that is the subject of either a disposition of property (including, without limitation, any property subject to a participation or repurchase transaction or in connection with the origination of any CLO Security or any Back-to-Back Transaction) permitted hereunder or a disposition to which the Required Lenders or the required number or percentage of Lenders have consented (and such Lien shall be released automatically to the extent provided in the Guarantee and Security Agreement, which includes the automatic release of any Lien covering Collateral that is the subject of a disposition to a Person that is not an Obligor in a transaction not prohibited under this Agreement (including, without limitation, any asset subject to a participation interest or repurchase transaction not prohibited hereunder) and each then extant Designated Indebtedness Document), (2) release from the Guarantee and Security Agreement any Subsidiary Guarantor (and any property of such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is designated as a Designated Subsidiary or becomes an Excluded Asset or an Immaterial Subsidiary in accordance with this Agreement or is otherwise no longer required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor (including, without limitation, because it ceases to be consolidated on the Borrower s financial statements), in each case pursuant to a transaction permitted hereunder, so long as (A) immediately after giving effect to any such release under this clause (2) and any Concurrent Transactions, the Covered Debt Amount does not exceed the Borrowing Base and the Borrower delivers a certificate of a Financial Officer to such effect to the Administrative Agent, (B) immediately after giving effect to any Concurrent Transactions, either (I) the amount of any excess availability under the Borrowing Base immediately prior to such release is not diminished as a result of such release or (II) the Adjusted Gross Borrowing Base, immediately after giving effect to such release is at least 110 of the Covered Debt Amount and (C) no Specified Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 
 (d)	 Replacement of Non-Consenting Lender .

 158 

more Lenders whose consent is required for such proposed change, waiver, amendment, consent, discharge or termination is not obtained, then (so long as no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (i), (j) or (k) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing) the Borrower shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders with one or more replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 2.20(b) so long as at the time of such replacement, each such replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge, termination or addition.

In addition, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and each Lender may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to any market data collector or similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in connection with the administration or servicing of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.

Such remedy shall not be deemed to 
 170 

be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other legal, equitable or contractual remedies that the Borrower may have.

Each Obligor agrees that nothing in this Agreement or the Loan Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and such Obligor, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. The Obligors acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Obligors, on the other, and (ii) solely in connection therewith and solely with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Obligor, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Obligor, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to any Obligor except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender is acting hereunder solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Obligor, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the process leading thereto. Each Obligor agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services in connection with the Loan Documents of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Obligor, solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or the process leading thereto. 
 SECTION 9.17.	 Certain ERISA Matters .

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

 Rules for 
 Employee Investing 
 CODE OF ETHICS FOR PERSONAL INVESTING 
 Fund Access Version 

Rules for Employee Investing 
 These Rules for Employee Investing contain the Code of Ethics for Personal Investing and the Global Policy on Inside Information. 
 The Fund Access Version of the Code of Ethics for Personal Investing contains rules about owning and trading securities for personal benefit. This version applies to officers, directors, and employees of Fidelity companies that are involved in the management and operations of Fidelity s funds, or have access to non-public information about the funds, including investment advisors to the funds, the principal underwriter of the funds, and anyone designated by the Ethics Office. Keep in mind that if you change jobs within Fidelity, a different version of the Code of Ethics may apply to you. 
 The Global Policy on Inside Information, which applies to every Fidelity employee, contains rules on inside information and how to prevent its unauthorized use or dissemination. 
 1 | Code of Ethics for Personal Investing 
 
 The Rules for Employee Investing are fairly comprehensive. They cover most of the personal investing situations a Fidelity employee is likely to experience. Yet it s always possible you will encounter a situation that isn t fully addressed by the rules. If that happens, you need to know what to do. The easiest way to make sure you are making the right decision is to follow these three principles: 
 1. Know the policy. 

If you think your situation isn t covered, check again. It never hurts to take a second look at the rules. 
 
 2. Seek guidance. 

Asking questions is always appropriate. Talk with your manager or the Ethics Office if you re not sure about the policy requirements or how they apply to your situation. Additionally, resources are available at MyCompliance to assist you with your questions. 
 3. Use sound judgment. 

Analyze the situation and weigh the options. Think about how your decision would look to an outsider. 
 Understanding and following the Rules for Employee Investing is one of the most important ways we can ensure our customers interests always come first.

1 | Code of Ethics for Personal Investing 
 Fund Access Version 
 Following the rules in letter and in spirit 
 This Fund Access Version of the Code of Ethics contains rules about owning and trading securities for personal benefit. Certain rules, which are noted, apply both to you and to anyone else who is a covered person (see Key Concepts on page 14). 
 You have a fiduciary duty to never place your personal interests ahead of the interests of Fidelity s clients, including shareholders of the Fidelity funds. This means never taking unfair advantage of your relationship to the funds or Fidelity in attempting 
 to benefit yourself or another party. It also means avoiding any actual or potential 
 conflicts of interest with the funds or Fidelity when managing your personal investments. 
 Because no set of rules can anticipate every possible situation, it is essential that you follow these rules not just in letter, but in spirit as well. Any activity that compromises Fidelity s integrity, even if it does not expressly violate a rule, has the potential to harm Fidelity s reputation and may result in scrutiny or further action from the Ethics Office. 

WHAT S REQUIRED 
 
 Acknowledging that you understand the rules 
 When you begin working for Fidelity, and again each year, you are required to: 
 acknowledge that you understand and will comply with all rules that apply to you 

authorize Fidelity to have access to all your covered accounts (see Key Concepts on page 14) and to obtain and review account and transaction data (including duplicate copies of non-Fidelity account statements) for compliance or employment-related purposes 

acknowledge that you will comply with any new or existing rules that become applicable to you in the future 

To Do 
 Promptly take action on any emails or alerts that you receive from the Ethics Office requiring you to acknowledge the Code of Ethics. All employees need to acknowledge within 10 days of receipt. 

Complying with securities laws 
 In addition to complying with these rules and other company-wide policies, you need to comply with U.S. securities laws and any other securities laws to which you are subject. 
 
 Reporting violations to the Ethics Office 
 If you become aware that you or someone else has violated any of these rules, you need to promptly report the violation. 
 To Do 

Call the Ethics Office Service Line at 617-563-5566 or 800-580-8780. 

Call the Chairman s Line at 800-242-4762 if you would prefer to speak on a non-recorded line. 

Disclosing securities accounts and holdings in covered securities 
 You must disclose all securities accounts those that hold covered securities (see Key Concepts on page 14) and those that do not. You must also disclose all covered securities held in your covered accounts and those not held in an account. This rule covers not only securities accounts and holdings under your own name or control, but also those under the name or control (including trading discretion or investment control) of your covered persons (see Key Concepts on page 14). It includes securities accounts held at Fidelity as well as those held at other financial institutions. Information regarding these holdings must not be more than 45 days old when you submit it. 
 
 To Do 
 Employees newly subject to this rule 
 Within 10 days of hire or of being noti ed by the Ethics Office that this version of the Code of Ethics applies to you, you will be asked to certify as to your understanding of the applicable Code of Ethics and, in conjunction with your certi cation, you will be 

required to disclose all your securities accounts and holdings in covered securities not held in an account. Submit the most recent statement for each securities account listed to the Ethics Office if not held at Fidelity. 
 Current employees 
 Each year, you will be asked to complete an Annual Code of Ethics Certi cation. You will be required to con rm that all information previously disclosed is accurate and complete. 

As soon as any new securities account is opened, or a preexisting securities account becomes associated with you (such as through marriage or inheritance), complete an Account Disclosure Form (available at MyCompliance.fmr.com) with the new 

information and submit it promptly to the Ethics Office. 
 On your next Quarterly Trade Veri cation, con rm that the list of disclosed securities accounts in the appropriate section of the report is accurate and complete.

Disclosing transactions of covered securities

For accounts held at FBS a nd DBS that you have disclosed, the Ethics Office will receive transaction reports automatically. For approved covered accounts held outside FBS or DBS, comply with any Ethics Office requests for duplicate reporting. For any other transactions in covered securities (for example, if you or any of your covered persons purchases interests in a Fidelity-advised investment product in a non-brokerage account outside Fidelity), you need to disclose this transaction information to the Ethics Office. 
 Exception 
 You do not have to report transactions in a covered account if the transactions are being made through an approved discretionary managed account or under an automatic investment plan (see Key Concepts on 

page 14) and the details of the account or plan have been provided to the Ethics Office.

 For transactions in covered securities not made through a covered account, submit a completed Securit y Transaction s r eport (available at MyCompliance.fmr.com) to the Ethics Office within 30 days following 

the end of the quarter in which the transaction was completed.

This includes, among other things, inheritances of covered securities and donations of covered securities to charities.

 You and your covered persons need prior written approval from the Ethics Office for each and every intended investment in a private placement or other private securities transaction in covered securities, including non-public limited entities (e.g., limited partnerships, LLCs, S Corporations, or other legal entities). This includes any add-on, any subsequent investment, or any investment whose terms materially differ from any previous approval you may have received. 
 To Do 
 Before engaging in any private securities transaction, submit a Private Securities Request form (available at MyCompliance.fmr.com). 

Report the nal transaction within 30 days following the end of the quarter in which it was completed using a Securit y Transaction s r eport (available at MyCompliance.fmr.com). 

When requested each quarter, promptly con rm or update your transaction history in private securities transactions on the Quarterly Trade Veri cation. 

Con rm your holdings in completing your Annual Code of Ethics Certi cation. 

For private securities transactions offered by a Fidelity company, the Ethics Office will typically preapprove such investments for employees who are offered an opportunity to invest. In such cases, you will receive notification that the offering has been preapproved by the Ethics Office. 
 
 Prohibited transaction 
 You and your covered persons are prohibited from selling and/or offering your privately held shares into an IPO. 
 
 Delegating pre-clearance responsibilities 
 In very limited circumstances, you may, with the prior written approval of the Ethics Office, designate someone to obtain pre- clearance approvals for you. In such a case, the agent is responsible for obtaining the correct approvals, and you are responsible for maintain- ing reasonable supervision over that person s activities related to pre-clearance. 

Clearing trades in advance (pre-clearance) 
 You and your covered persons must obtain pre- clearance approval before placing any orders to buy, sell, or tender a covered security (see How to Pre- Clear a Trade in the sidebar). The purpose of this rule is to reduce the possibility of conflicts between personal trades in covered securities and trades made by the funds. When you apply for pre- clearance, you are not just asking for approval, you are giving your word that you and your covered persons: 
 do not have any inside information on the security you want to trade (see Global Policy on Inside Information on page 15) 

are not using knowledge of actual or potential fund trades to bene t yourself or others 

believe the trade is available to the general investor on the same terms 

will provide any relevant information requested by the Ethics Office 

Generally, requests will not be approved if it is determined that your transaction may take advantage of trading by the funds or create an actual or perceived conflict of interest with fund trades. 
 Note: If a non-covered person has authority to trade on one of your covered account(s), the non-covered person is also expected to pre-clear trades for that covered account. 
 The rules of pre-clearance 
 It is important to understand the following rules before requesting pre-clearance for a trade: 
 You have to request and receive pre- clearance approval during the market session in which you intend to trade and prior to placing the trade. 

Pre-clearance approval is only good during the market session for which you receive it. If you do not trade during the market session for which you were granted approval, it expires. 

Place day orders only (orders that automatically expire at the end of the trading session). Good-til- cancelled orders (such as orders that 

stay open inde nitely until a security reaches a speci ed market price) are not permitted. 
 Check the status of all orders at the end of the market session and cancel any orders that have not been executed. If any covered person leaves 

an order open and it is executed the next day (or later), it will generate a violation that will be assigned to you. 

Trade only during the regular market hours, or the after-hours trading session, of the exchange(s) where the security in question is traded. 

Place requests for pre-clearance after the market has been open for a while, as pre-clearance is not available right at market opening. To nd out when pre-clearance for a given market typically becomes available, visit preclear.fmr.com (internal) or preclear. delity.com (external). 

Unless an exception listed below applies or the Ethics Office has instructed you otherwise, these pre-clearance rules apply to all your covered accounts including Fidelity accounts and any outside covered accounts that belong to you or any of your covered persons. 

Exceptions 
 You do not need to pre-clear trades or transactions in certain covered securities. These include: 
 shares of Fidelity funds 

exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 

(note that you and your covered persons are restricted from trading in single-stock ETFs) 
 options and futures that are based on an index (e.g., S P 100 and S P 500) or that are based on one or more instruments that are not covered securities (e.g. commodities, currencies, and U.S. Treasuries; see Key Concepts on page 14 for an expanded list of non-covered securities) 

securities being transferred as a gift or a donation 

automatic dividend reinvestments 

subscription rights 

currency warrants 

the regular exercise of an employee stock option (note that any resulting sale of the underlying stock at current market prices 

must be pre- cleared) 
 With the prior written approval of the Ethics Office, there are a few situations where you may be permitted to trade without pre-clearing. These situations are: 
 trades in a discretionary managed account (see Key Concepts on page 14) 

trades made through an automatic investment plan, the details of which have been disclosed to the Ethics Office in advance 

when you can show that a repeated rejection of your pre-clearance request is causing a signi cant hardship 

To Do 
 Before placing any trade in a covered security, 

pre-clear it using the Fidelity Global Pre-Clearance System, available at preclear.fmr.com (internal) and preclear. delity.com 
 (external). 
 Immediately cancel any good-til-cancelled orders in your covered accounts. 

Option transactions under the 60-Day Rule 
 Option transactions can be matched either to a prior purchase of the under- lying security or to prior option transactions in the opposite direction. 
 When matching an option transaction to prior purchases of the underlying security, opening an option position by selling a call or buying a put is treated as a sale and will be matched to any purchases of the underlying security made during the preceding 60 days. 
 When matching an option transaction to prior option transactions, a closing position is matched to any like opening positions taken during the preceding 60 days. 
 When exercising an option, the initial purchase or sale of an option, not the exercise or assignment of the option, is matched to any opposite transactions made during the preceding 60 days. The sale of the underlying securities received from the exercise of an option will also be matched to any opposite transactions made during the period. 
 There is no exception to the 60-Day Rule for the selling of securities upon the automatic exercise of an option that is in the money at its expiration date. To avoid surrendering 60-day gains that would result from an automatic liquidation, you need to cancel the automatic liquidation before it happens. 
 Surrendering 60-day gains (60-Day Rule) 
 Any sale of covered securities in a covered account will be matched against any purchases of that security, 
 or its equivalent, in the same account during the previous 60 days (starting with the earliest purchase in the 60-day period). Any gain resulting from any matched transactions must be surrendered. For specific information about how certain option transactions are treated under this rule, see the sidebar and the examples below. 
 In addition, the premium received from the opening of an option position in which the expiration of that contract will occur within the next 60 days must be surrendered (e.g., selling a call to open or selling a put to open that expires within 60 days). 
 Gains are calculated differently under this rule than they would be for tax purposes. Neither losses nor potential tax liabilities will be offset against the amount that must be surrendered under this rule. 
 Exceptions 
 This rule does not apply: 
 to transactions in shares of Fidelity funds 

to transactions in options and futures on, or ETFs that track, the following indexes: Dow Jones Industrial Average, FTSE 100, FTSE 250, 

Hang Seng, MSCI China, MSCI EAFE, MSCI EM, NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225, NSE S P CNX Nifty 
 (Nifty 50), Russell 1000, Russell 2000, Russell 3000, 
 S P 100, S P 500, S P Europe 350, S P MidCap 
 400, and S P/TSX 60 
 to transactions in options, futures, and ETFs based on one or more instruments that are not covered securities (e.g., commodities, currencies, and U.S. Treasuries; see Key Concepts on page 14 for an expanded list of non-covered securities) 

to transactions made in a discretionary managed account (see Key Concepts on page 14) that has been approved by the Ethics Office 

to transactions under an automatic investment plan, and the details of the plan have been provided to the Ethics Office 

to tax-planning transactions, provided that there is a demonstration of how the proposed transaction relates to the covered person s tax strategy; this 

exception is not automatic, is granted on a case-by-case basis, and requires advanced review and written approval of the Ethics Office 

when the rule would impose a substantial unforeseen personal nancial hardship on the employee; this exception is not automatic, is granted on a case-by-case basis, and requires advanced review and written approval of the Ethics Office (note that an employee seeking relief must establish a bona de nancial hardship, such as unforeseen medical expenses, and should be prepared to demonstrate, among other things, that he or she possesses no other assets to meet the nancial need) 

To Do 
 Before trading a covered security in a covered account that might trigger the 60-Day Rule, make sure you understand how much may have to be surrendered. The calculation may be complicated, especially if options or multiple prior purchases are involved. If you have any questions about this provision, call the Ethics Office at 617-563-5566 or 800-580-8780. 

To request permission for a tax-planning or hardship exception, you must contact the Ethics Office before trading. Allow at least two business days for your request to be considered. Approvals will be based on fund trading and other pre-clearance tests. You are limited to a total of ve exceptions per calendar year across all your covered accounts.

 Selling short 
 Selling a security that is on loan to you from a broker- dealer (rather than owned by you) at the time you sell it. 

Option transactions 
 You are not permitted to use the same underlying shares of a security to cover two different option transactions (e.g., if you own 100 shares of a stock, you can sell 1 covered call or buy 1 protective put using those shares to cover your short position, but you cannot execute both option transactions using the same underlying shares). 

WHAT S PROHIBITED 
 
 Trading restricted securities 
 Neither you nor your covered persons may trade a security that Fidelity has restricted. If you have been notified not to trade a particular security, neither you nor your covered persons may trade that security until you are notified that the restriction has been removed. 
 
 Note: Fidelity has restricted trading in all single-stock exchange traded products. 
 
 Selling short 
 The short position in a particular covered security may not exceed the number of shares of that security held in the same account. This prohibition includes the following actions: selling securities short, buying puts to open, selling calls to open, as well as writing straddles, collars, and spreads. 
 Exceptions 
 Options and futures on, or ETFs that track, the following indexes: Dow Jones Industrial Average, FTSE 100, FTSE 250, Hang Seng, MSCI China, MSCI EAFE, MSCI EM, NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225, 

NSE S P CNX Nifty (Nifty 50), Russell 1000, Russell 2000, Russell 3000, S P 100, S P 500, S P 
 Europe 350, S P MidCap 400, and S P/TSX 60 
 Options, futures, and ETFs based on one or more instruments that are not covered securities (e.g., commodities, currencies, and U.S. Treasuries; 

see Key Concepts on page 14 for an expanded list of non-covered securities) 

Participating in an IPO 
 Neither you nor your covered persons are allowed to participate in an initial public offering (IPO) of securities where no public market in a similar security of the issuer previously existed. This rule applies to equity securities, corporate debt securities, and free stock offers through the Internet. 
 Exceptions 
 With prior written approval from the Ethics Office, 
 you or your covered persons may participate if: 
 you or your covered persons have been offered shares because you already own equity in the company 

you or your covered persons have been offered shares because you are a policyholder or depositor of a mutual company that is reorganizing into a stock company 

you or your covered persons have been offered shares because of employment with the company 

you or your covered persons want to participate in an IPO of a closed-end fund 

To Do 
 For written approval to participate in an IPO that may qualify as an exception, submit to the Ethics Office a completed Request Initial Public Offering (IPO) Exception form (available at MyCompliance.fmr.com). 

Do not participate in any IPO without prior written approval from the Ethics Office. 

Participating in an investment club Neither you nor your covered persons may participate in an investment club or similar entity. 
 
 Investing in a hedge fund 
 Neither you nor your covered persons may invest in a hedge fund, alternative investment, or similar investment product or vehicle. 
 Exceptions 
 Investment products or vehicles issued or advised by Fidelity. 

A hedge fund, alternative investment, or similar investment product or vehicle that you or your covered persons bought before joining Fidelity. The prior written approval of your manager and the Ethics Office is required to qualify for this exception. Note 

that even if your request is approved, neither you nor your covered persons can make any further investments in the product. 

To Do 
 To request an exception, submit a Private Securities Request form (available at MyCompliance.fmr.com) to the Ethics Office. 

Excessive trading 
 Excessive trading in covered accounts is strongly discouraged. In general, anyone trading covered securities more than 60 times (other than Fidelity funds) in a quarter across all his or her covered accounts should expect additional scrutiny of his or her trades. Note that you and 
 your covered persons also need to comply with the policies in any Fidelity fund prospectus concerning excessive trading. 
 The Ethics Office monitors trading activity and may limit the number of trades allowed in your covered accounts during a given period. 
 Exceptions 
 Trades in a discretionary managed account (see Key Concepts on page 14) that has been approved by the Ethics Office. 

Trades made through an automatic, regular investment program that has been disclosed to the Ethics Office in advance. 

Buying securities of certain broker-dealers 
 Neither you nor your covered persons are allowed to buy the securities of a broker-dealer or its parent company if the Ethics Office has restricted those securities. 
 
 Trading after a research note 
 Neither you nor your covered persons are allowed to trade a covered security of an issuer until two full business days have elapsed following the date of the publication of a research note on that issuer by any Fidelity entity. For purposes of clarity, the prohibited period begins with the publication of the note and continues for an additional two full business days. 
 
 Profiting from knowledge of fund transactions 

You may not use your knowledge of transactions in funds or other accounts advised by any Fidelity entity to profit by the market effect of these transactions. 
 
 Influencing a fund to benefit yourself or others 
 The funds and accounts advised by Fidelity are required to act in the best interests of their shareholders and clients, respectively. Accordingly, you are prohibited from influencing any of these funds or accounts to act for the benefit of any party other than their shareholders or clients. 

For example, you may not influence a fund to buy, sell, or refrain from trading a security that would affect that security s price to advance your own interests or the interests of a party that has or seeks to have a business relationship with Fidelity. 
 
 Attempting to defraud a client or fund 
 Attempting to defraud a fund or an account advised by any Fidelity entity in any way is a violation of Fidelity s rules and securities law. 
 
 Using a derivative to get around a rule 
 If something is prohibited by these rules, then it 
 is also against these rules to effectively accomplish the same thing by using a derivative. This includes futures, options, and other types of derivatives. 

HOW WE ENFORCE THE CODE OF ETHICS 
 
 The Ethics Office regularly reviews the forms and reports it receives. If these reviews turn up information that is incomplete, questionable, or potentially in violation of the Code of Ethics, the Ethics Office will investigate the matter and may contact you. 
 
 If it is determined that you or any of your covered persons has violated the Code of Ethics, the Ethics Office or another appropriate party may take action. Among other things, subject to applicable law, potential actions may include: 

an informational memorandum a written warning 

a fine, a deduction from wages, disgorgement of profit, or other payment a limitation or ban on personal trading 

referral of the matter to Human Resources 

dismissal from employment 

referral of the matter to civil or criminal authorities 

disclosure of the matter to a regulator as required by law or regulation 

Fidelity takes all Code of Ethics violations seriously, and, at least once a year, provides the funds trustees with a summary of actions taken in response to material violations of the Code of Ethics. You should be aware that other securities laws and regulations not addressed by the Code of Ethics may also apply to you, depending on your role at Fidelity. 
 
 The Head of Ethics and their designees retain the discretion to interpret and grant exceptions to the Code of Ethics and to decide how the rules apply to any given situation for the purpose of protecting the funds and being consistent with the general principles and objectives of the Code of Ethics. 
 
 Exceptions In cases where exceptions to the Code of Ethics are noted and you may qualify for them, you need to get prior written approval from the Ethics Office. The way to request any particular exception is discussed in the text of the relevant rule. If you believe that you have a situation that warrants an exception that is not discussed in the Code of Ethics, you may submit a written request to the Ethics Office. Your request will be considered by the Ethics Office, and you will be noti ed of the outcome. 
 
 Appeals If you believe a request of yours has been incorrectly denied or that an action is not warranted, you may appeal the decision. To make an appeal, you need to provide the Ethics Office with a written explanation of your reasons for appeal within 30 days of when you were informed of the decision. Be sure to include any extenuating circumstances or other factors not previously considered. During the review process, you may, at your 
 own expense, engage an attorney to represent you. The Ethics Office may arrange for senior management or other parties to be part of the review process. The Ethics Office will notify you in writing about the outcome of your appeal. 

Additional Rules for Traders, 
 Research Analysts, and Portfolio Managers 
 Employees trading for the funds (traders), employees making investment recommendations for the funds (research analysts), and employees who manage a fund or a portion of a fund s assets (portfolio managers) 

WHAT S REQUIRED 
 
 Notification of your ownership of covered securities in a research note 
 You must check the box on a research note you are publishing to indicate any ownership, either by you or your covered persons, of any covered security of an issuer (see Key Concepts on page 14) that is the subject of the research note. 
 
 Disclosing trading opportunities to the funds before personally trading 
 There are three aspects to this rule: 
 Disclosing information received from an issuer 
 Any time you receive, directly from an issuer, material information about that issuer (that is not considered inside information), you must check to see if that information has been disclosed to the funds in a research note. If not, you must communicate that information to the funds before you or any of your covered persons personally trade any securities of that issuer. 
 To Do 
 Con rm whether a Fidelity research note has been published with the relevant information. 

If not, publish a research note or provide the information to the relevant head of research. 

If you are a trader, disclose the information to the analyst covering the issuer. 

If you think you may have received inside information, follow the rules in the Global Policy on Inside Information (see page 15). 

Disclosing information about an issuer that is assigned to you 
 If you are a research analyst, you must disclose in a research note material information you have about an issuer that is assigned to you before you or any of your covered persons personally trade a security of that issuer. 
 Exception 
 You or any of your covered persons may be permitted to trade the assigned security in a covered account without publishing a research note if you have obtained the prior approval of both the relevant head of research and the Ethics Office. 

To Do 
 Publish a research note with the relevant information, and indicate any ownership interest in the issuer that you or your covered persons may have before personally trading a security you are assigned to cover. 

Note: You will not be able to obtain pre- clearance approval for your personal trade until two full business days have elapsed (not including the day the note was published) following the publication of your research note. 

To request an exception to this rule, rst contact the relevant head of research and seek approval. Then contact the Ethics Office for approval. Do not personally trade the security until you have received full approval. 

Recommending trading opportunities 
 In addition, you must recommend for the funds, and, if you are a portfolio manager, trade for the funds, a suitable security before personally trading that security. 
 WHAT S PROHIBITED 
 
 Trading within seven days of a fund you manage 
 Neither you nor your covered persons are allowed to trade within seven calendar days (not including the day of the trade) before or after a trade is executed in any covered security of the same issuer (see Key Concepts on page 14) by any of the funds you manage. 
 Exceptions 
 When the rule would work to the disadvantage of a fund 
 You must never let a personal trade prevent a fund you manage from subsequently trading a covered security of the same issuer, if not making the trade would disadvantage the fund. However, you need approval from the Ethics Office before making any trades under this exception. The Ethics Office will need to know, among other things, what new information arose since the date of the trade in your covered account. 
 When the con icting fund trade results from standing orders 

A personal trade may precede a fund trade in a covered security of the same issuer when the fund s trade was generated independently by the trading desk because of a standing instruction to trade proportionally across the fund s holdings in response to fund cash ows. 

When the con icting fund trade is the result of a proportional slice 
 A personal trade may precede a fund trade in a covered security of the same issuer when the fund s trade was conducted as part of the execution of a proportional slice across the fund for cash management or rebalancing purposes. 
 When the covered account is independently managed 
 This exception applies only to discretionary managed accounts (See Key Concepts on page 14) that have received Ethics Office approval. 
 When the con icting personal trade or fund trade is in options or futures on, or ETFs that track, the following indexes: Dow Jones Industrial Average, FTSE 100, FTSE 2 50, Hang Seng, MSCI China, MSCI EAFE, MSCI EM, NASDAQ 100, Nikkei 225, NSE S P 
 CNX Nifty (Nifty 50), Russell 1000, Russell 2000, 
 Russell 3000, S P 100, S P 500, S P Europe 350, S P 
 MidCap 400, and S P/TSX 60 
 When the con icting personal trade or fund trade is in options, futures, or ETFs based on one or more instruments that are not covered securities (e.g., commodities, currencies, and U.S. Treasuries; see Key Concepts on page 14 for an expanded list of non- covered securities). 
 
 To Do 
 Before trading personally, consider whether there is any likelihood that you may be interested in trading a covered security of the same issuer in your assigned funds within seven calendar days following the day of the fund trade. If so, refrain from personally 

trading in a covered account. 
 If a fund you manage has recently traded a security, you must delay any covered account trades in any covered security of the same issuer for seven calendar days following the day of the most recent fund trade. 

Contact the Ethics Office immediately to discuss any situation where these rules would work to the disadvantage of the funds. 

Legal Information The Code of Ethics for Personal Investing constitutes the code of ethics required by Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and by Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 for the Fidelity funds, investment advisers or principal underwriters, and any other entity designated by the Ethics Office. 

KEY CONCEPTS 
 These definitions encompass broad categories, and the examples given are not all inclusive. If you have any questions regarding these definitions or application of these rules to a person, security, or account that is not addressed in this section, you can contact the Ethics Office for additional guidance. 

Covered person 
 
 Fidelity is concerned not only that you observe the requirements of the Code of Ethics, but also that those in whose affairs you are actively involved observe the Code of Ethics . This means that the Code of Ethics can apply to persons owning assets over which you have control or influence or in which you have an opportunity to directly or indirectly profit or share in any profit derived from a securities transaction. This includes: 
 
 you 

your spouse or domestic partner who shares your household 

any other immediate family member who shares your household and (a) is under 18 or (b) is supported financially by you or who financially supports you 

anyone else the Ethics Office has designated as a covered person 

This is not an exclusive list, and a covered person may include, for example, immediate family members who live with you but whom you do not financially support, or whom you financially support or who financially support you but who do not live with you. If you have any doubt as to whether a person would be considered a covered person under the Code of Ethics , contact the Ethics Office. 
 
 Immediate family member 
 Your spouse or domestic partner who shares your household, and anyone who is related to you in any of the following ways, whether by blood, adoption, or marriage: 
 
 children, stepchildren, and grandchildren 

parents, stepparents, and grandparents 

siblings 

parents-, children-, and siblings-in-law 

Domestic partner 
 A person in a marriage-like relationship with you who is not your relative, has reached the age of majority, and is not married to any other person. You and your domestic partner must have lived together for at least one year, with the intent to be life partners, and generally must be economically interdependent. 
 Covered account 
 The term covered account encompasses a fairly wide range of accounts. Important factors to consider are: 
 
 your actual or potential investment control over an account, including whether you have trading authority, power of attorney, or investment control over an account 

Specifically, a covered account is a brokerage account or any other type of account that holds, or is capable of holding, a covered security, and that belongs to, or is controlled by (including trading discretion or investment control), any of the following: 
 
 a covered person 

any corporation or similar entity where a covered person is a controlling shareholder or participates in investment decisions by the entity 

any trust of which you or any of your covered persons: 

participates in making investment decisions for the trust 

is a trustee of the trust 

is a settlor who can independently revoke the trust and participate in making investment decisions for the trust 

Exception 
 With prior written approval from the Ethics Office, a covered account may qualify for an exception from these rules where: 
 
 it is the account of a nonprofit organization and a covered person is a member of a board or committee responsible for the investments of the organization, provided that the covered person does not participate in investment decisions with respect to covered securities 

it is an educational institution s account that is used in connection with an investment course that is part of an MBA or other educational program, and a covered person participates in investment decisions with respect to the account 

Fidelity fund 
 The terms fund and Fidelity fund mean any investment company or pool of assets that is advised or sub advised by any Fidelity entity. 
 Issuer 
 An entity, including its wholly owned bank branch, foreign office, or term note program that offers securities or other financial instruments to investors. 
 Discretionary Managed Account 
 
 A covered account may be eligible for certain exceptions, as specified in the Code of Ethics, with prior written approval of the Ethics Office validating that the covered account is managed by a third-party investment advisor who has discretionary trading authority over that covered account. To qualify for this exception, the third-party investment advisor must exercise all trading discretion over the covered account and will not accept any order to buy or sell specific securities from the employee or any other covered person. An approved discretionary managed account will still be subject to the Code of Ethics and all provisions in the Code of Ethics unless otherwise stated in a specific exception. 
 
 Covered security 
 
 This definition applies to all persons subject to this version of the Code of Ethics . 
 
 Covered securities include securities in which a covered person has the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in such securities, and encompasses most types of securities, including, but not limited to: 
 
 shares of Fidelity mutual funds (except money market funds), including shares of Fidelity funds in a 529 plan 

shares of another company s mutual fund if it is advised by Fidelity (check the prospectus to see if this is the case)

shares, debentures, or other securities issued by FMR LLC to you as compensation or a benefit associated with your employment 

U.S. Treasury securities 

obligations of U.S. government agencies with remaining maturities of one year or less

fidelity funds 
 CODE OF ETHICS 
 FOR PRESIDENT, TREASURER 
 AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER 

2023 

FIDELITY FUNDS CODE OF ETHICS FOR 
 PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER 

I. Purposes of the Code/Covered Officers 
 
 This document constitutes the Code of Ethics (Code) adopted by the Fidelity Funds (Funds) pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Code applies to the Fidelity Funds President and Treasurer, and Chief Financial Officer (Covered Officers). Fidelity s Ethics Office, within Enterprise Compliance, administers the Code. 
 
 The purposes of the Code are to deter wrongdoing and to promote, on the part of the Covered Officers: 
 
 honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 

full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Fidelity Funds submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other public communications by a Fidelity Fund; 

compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; 

the prompt internal reporting to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of violations of the Code; and 

accountability for adherence to the Code. 

Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. 
 
 II.	Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically 
 Actual and Apparent Conflicts of Interest 
 
 Overview. A conflict of interest occurs when a Covered Officer s private interest interferes with the interests of, or their service to, the Fidelity Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of their family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of their position with the Fidelity Funds. 
 
 Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Covered Officers and the Fidelity Funds and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with a Fidelity Fund because of their status as affiliated persons of the Fund. Separate compliance programs and procedures of the Fidelity Funds, Fidelity Management Research Company (FMR) and the other Fidelity companies are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code. 
 
 Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between the Fidelity Funds and FMR (or another Fidelity company) of which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fidelity Funds, FMR or another Fidelity company), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that have different effects on the Fidelity Funds, FMR and other Fidelity companies. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Fidelity Funds and FMR (or another Fidelity company) and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of 
 2023 

their duties as officers of the Fidelity Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds Board of Trustees (Board) that the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other Fidelity Funds covered by this Code. 
 
 Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of a Fidelity Fund. 

Each Covered Officer must: 
 
 not use their personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by any Fidelity Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of any Fidelity Fund; 

not cause a Fidelity Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of the Fidelity Fund; 

not engage in any outside business activity, including serving as a director or trustee, that prevents the Covered Officer from devoting appropriate time and attention to the Covered Officer s responsibilities with the Fidelity Funds; 

not have a consulting or employment relationship with any of the Fidelity Funds service providers that are not affiliated with Fidelity; and 

not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of actual or potential misconduct, which are made in good faith. 

With respect to other fact patterns, if a Covered Officer is in doubt, other potential conflict of interest situations should be described immediately to the Fidelity Ethics Office for resolution. Similarly, any questions a Covered Officer has generally regarding the application or interpretation of the Code should be directed to the Fidelity Ethics Office immediately. 
 
 III. Disclosure and Compliance 
 
 Each Covered Officer should familiarize themself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fidelity Funds. 

Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about any Fidelity Fund to others, whether within or outside Fidelity, including to the Board and auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations; 

Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within their area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Fidelity Funds, FMR and the Fidelity service providers, and with the Board s Compliance Committee, with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fidelity Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Fidelity Funds; and 

It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

2023 

IV. Reporting and Accountability 
 
 Each Covered Officer must: 
 
 upon receipt of the Code, and annually thereafter, submit to the Fidelity Ethics Office an acknowledgement stating that they have received, read, and understand the Code; and 

notify the Fidelity Ethics Office promptly if they know of any violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code . 

The Fidelity Ethics Office shall take all action it considers appropriate to investigate any actual or potential violations reported to it. Upon completion of the investigation, if necessary, the matter will be reviewed with senior management or other appropriate parties, and a determination will be made as to whether any action should be taken as detailed below. The Covered Officer will be informed of any action determined to be appropriate. The Fidelity Ethics Office will inform the Personal Trading Committee of all Code violations and actions taken in response. Without implied limitation, appropriate remedial, disciplinary or preventive action may include a written warning, a letter of censure, suspension, dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement authorities. Additionally, other legal remedies may be pursued. 
 
 The policies and procedures described in the Code do not create any obligations to any person or entity other than the Fidelity Funds. The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fidelity Funds and does not constitute a promise, contract or an admission by or on behalf of any Fidelity Fund as to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion. The Fidelity Funds, the Fidelity companies and the Fidelity Head of Ethics retain the discretion to decide whether the Code applies to a specific situation, and how it should be interpreted. 
 
 V. Oversight 
 
 Material violations of this Code will be reported promptly by FMR (or another Fidelity company) to the Board s Compliance Committee. In addition, at least once each year, FMR (or another Fidelity company) will provide a written report to the Board, which describes any issues arising under the Code since the last report to the Board, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the Code and action taken in response to the material violations. 

VI. Other Policies and Procedures 
 
 This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fidelity Funds for purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Other Fidelity policies or procedures that cover the behavior or activities of Covered Officers are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers (and others) and are not part of this Code. 
 
 VII. Amendments 
 
 Any material amendments or changes to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fidelity Funds. 
 
 VIII. Records and Confidentiality 
 
 Records of any violation of the Code and of the actions taken as a result of such violations will be kept by the Fidelity Ethics Office. All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be 
 2023 

considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fidelity Ethics Office, the Personal Trading Committee, the Board, appropriate personnel at the relevant Fidelity company or companies and the legal counsel of any or all of the foregoing.
