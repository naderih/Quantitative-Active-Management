Optical Components 

Medical Device Products and Assemblies 

Technology Rights 

Total Revenues 

Other selling costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are expensed as
incurred due to the short-term nature of a majority of contracts. The Company extends terms of payment to its customers based on commercially
reasonable terms for the markets of its customers, while also considering their credit quality. Shipping and handling costs charged to
customers are included in revenue. 

Revenue recognition policies for each of the four product and service
types appear below. 

Engineering Design Services 

The Company enters into contractual agreements
with our customers, including design services agreements, statements of work and receive purchase orders for development projects. These
agreements provide costs on an estimated basis for the services we have agreed to provide. Engineering Design Services are rendered on
a time and materials basis. The Company recognizes revenue as customers are invoiced for the actual engineering services provided in the
period. Revenue is also recognized on materials purchased for development projects at the time of receipt. Engineering Design Services
are provided on a best-efforts basis; no warranty is provided as there is no guarantee that the work will result in the attainment of
the customer s project objectives. The Company may obtain customer deposits in advance of rendering engineering design services.
Customer deposits are treated as contractual liabilities until the terms of customer agreements are satisfied and are not a component
of revenue. 

Optical Components, Finished Products and Assemblies 

The Company provides fixed price quotations to
our customers and requires purchase orders for all purchased optical components, medical devices and assemblies. Revenue is recognized
at the time title passes to our customer based on our review of the customer contract, generally at the time of shipment from our facilities.
Occasionally the Company may enter into bill and hold contractual arrangements where title is held by our customers while
goods are stored at our facilities for their convenience. 

Technology Rights and Royalties 

The Company may recognize
revenue for the sale of technology rights and through the receipt of royalties obtained under a license of our intellectual property.
These revenues are recognized in the period in which, in our judgment, they are earned and no longer contingent under the terms and conditions
of the relevant customer contract. 

Contract Assets and Liabilities 

The nature of the Company s products and
services does not generally give rise to contract assets as it typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a product or
service is provided to a customer. The Company s costs to obtain contracts are typically in the form of sales commissions paid to
employees. The Company has elected to expense sales commissions associated with obtaining a contract as incurred as the amortization period
is generally less than one year. These costs have been recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31,
2023, there were no contract assets recorded in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company s contract liabilities arise
from unearned revenue received from customers at inception of contracts or where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction
of our performance obligations. The Company generally satisfies performance obligations within one year from the contract s inception
date. 

Contract liabilities, which were recorded as
customer advances in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and unearned revenue are comprised of the following:

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to those
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and with our audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on September 28, 2023. 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements. When used in this report, the words anticipate, suggest, estimate, plan, project, continue, ongoing, potential,
expect, predict, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks described in this report, the risks described in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023 and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe
the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they relate only to events as of
the date on which the statements are made. We do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report
to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. 

Overview 

We have been a developer and manufacturer of advanced
optical instruments since 1982. Our proprietary medical instrumentation line, unique custom design and manufacturing capabilities, and
expert engineering and development has generated traditional proprietary endoscopes and endocouplers as well as other custom imaging and
illumination products for our customers use in minimally invasive surgical procedures. We design and manufacture 3D endoscopes
and very small Microprecision lenses, assemblies and complete medical devices to meet the surgical community s continuing demand
for smaller, disposable, and more enhanced imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery. 

Effective June 1, 2019 we acquired the operating
assets of Ross Optical Industries, Inc. of El Paso, Texas. As Ross Optical Industries we also operate as a supplier of custom optical
components and assemblies for military and defense, medical and various other industrial applications. All products sold by us under the
Ross Optical name include a custom or catalog optic, which is sourced through our extensive domestic and worldwide network of optical
fabrication suppliers. Most systems make use of optical lenses, prisms, mirrors and windows and range from individual optical components
to complex mechano-optical assemblies. Products often include thin film optical coatings that are applied using our in-house coating department. 

Effective October 1, 2021 we acquired the operating
assets of Lighthouse Imaging, LLC of Windham, Maine. Our Lighthouse Imaging division supplements our operations as a manufacturer of advanced
optical imaging systems and accessories and has provided further expertise in electrical engineering and development of end-to-end medical
visualization devices. Product development competencies at Lighthouse Imaging include Systems, Optical, Mechanical, Electrical and Process
Development Engineering. Since the purchase we have integrated these acquired engineering and operational capabilities to provide an expanded,
unified offering to our customers. Our product development team has extensive experience developing visualization systems that are used
in a variety of clinical applications. Lighthouse Imaging is an industry leader in chip-on-tip visualization systems. 

The markets in which we do business are highly
competitive and include both foreign and domestic competitors. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources
than we do. Furthermore, other domestic or foreign companies, some with greater financial resources than we have, may seek to produce
products or services that compete with ours. Over the years we have developed extensive experience collaborating with other optical specialists
worldwide. 

13 

The markets for our products have increasingly
been driven by the demand for smaller and more enhanced imaging systems by the needs of the surgical community, including applications
for the brain, eye, ear, urology, cardiology/angiography and the spine. We market directly to established medical device companies primarily
in the United States that we believe could benefit from our advanced endoscopy visualization systems. Through this direct marketing, referrals,
attendance at trade shows and a presence in online professional association websites, we have expanded our on-going pipeline of projects
to significant medical device companies as well as well-funded emerging technology companies. We expect our customer pipeline to continue
to expand as development projects transition to production orders and new customer projects enter the development phase. Our Ross Optical
division markets through existing customers and trade shows, in addition to proactive online marketing strategies executed primarily through
its website. 

We produce micro-precision optics, which are nominally
millimeter sized and smaller cameras with low manufacturing costs. The small size provides visualization for new procedures in new parts
of the body and for existing procedures that are currently performed blind or with sub-optimal imaging, facilitating the development of
new surgical procedures that are currently impractical. We use patented and patent-pending approaches to fabricating opto-mechanical and
opto-electronic systems. We have developed and helped commercialize applications for numerous customers in the medical device and defense/aerospace
industries. 

We believe that our future success depends to
a large degree on our ability to develop new optical products and services to enhance the performance characteristics and methods of
manufacture or existing products. Competition amongst medical device companies is increasing with multiple companies now pursuing less
expensive, procedure specific robotic systems. We expect to continue to seek and obtain product-related design and development contracts
with customers and to selectively invest our own funds on research and development, particularly in the areas of Microprecision optics,
micro medical cameras, illumination, single-use endoscopes, and 3D endoscopes. We are one of only a handful of companies in the world
to design and provide high-quality 3D endoscopes. By designing systems with low manufacturing costs, we have also begun to penetrate
the single-use endoscope market. Single-use endoscopes virtually eliminate the potential for patient cross-contamination and support
a number of additional operational benefits for hospitals and surgeons. We estimate this segment of the overall minimally invasive surgical
market is growing at two to three times the rate of the overall market. 

Current sales and marketing activities are intended
to broaden awareness of the benefits of our new technology platforms and our successful application of these new technologies to medical
device projects requiring surgical-grade visualization from millimeter sized devices and 3D endoscopy, including single-use products and
assemblies. 

We are registered to the ISO 9001:2015 and ISO
13485:2016 Quality Standards and comply with the FDA Good Manufacturing Practices.

General 

This management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions and any such differences may be material. 

There have been no significant changes in our
critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Notes to our Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2023.

31, 2023 were 4,824,289, as compared to 5,886,961 for the same period in the prior year, and for the six months ended December 31, 2023
was 9,145,544 as compared to 10,972,262 for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of 1,826,718, or 16.6 . A decrease of 600,000
in both periods was attributable to the sale of one-time technology rights recognized in the prior year. 

Revenue from Engineering Design Services increased
33.1 and 24.6 during the three- and six-month periods ending December 31, 2023 from the same periods in the year ending December 31,
2022. Revenue increases in the engineering category resulted from increasing demand for services and expansion of engineering capacity.
Engineering sales were driven by customer design engagements that will be transitioning into the later manufacture of new Finished Products
and Assemblies. 

Revenue from Optical Components decreased 23.3 
and 25.8 during the three- and six-month periods ending December 31, 2023 from the same periods in the year ending December 31, 2022
due in part to reduced industry demand. We believe the decreases in optical components were largely driven by lower order volumes as customers
sought to rebalance their inventories, which had previously grown beyond sustainable levels due to increased ordering in response to concerns
about supply chain disruptions. 

Revenue from Finished Products and Assemblies
decreased 42.4 and 38.9 during the three- and six-month periods ending December 31, 2023 from the same periods in the year ending December
31, 2022. The decreases in Finished Products and Assemblies was attributable to timing differences between the exit of certain mature
customer programs and reorders for ongoing products and the introduction of new customer programs, primarily single-use medical devices
and new defense / aerospace opportunities.

Gross Profit 

Gross margin decreased to 30.1 during the three
months ended December 30, 2023, compared to 44.2 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased to 31.9 during the six
months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 38.6 during the six months ended December 31, 2022. Gross profit decreased to 1,450,976 during
the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2,599,472 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased to 2,914,587
during the six months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 4,238,913 during the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by
changes in the product sales mix and the decreases in revenue discussed above. The 600,000 in Technology rights revenue in the prior
year had a significant impact on gross margin as it had no cost of sales associated with it. Excluding that revenue from both sales and
gross profit for comparison purposes, the gross margin would have been 37.8 and 35.1 for the three- and six-month periods ending December
31, 2022, respectively. In addition, we recorded an increase in our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory in the amount of 75,000. 

Research Development 

R D expenses increased 66,464 to 221,728
during the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 155,264 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased 68,595
to 434,486 during the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 365,891 during the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase
in R D expenses was primarily due to employee-related expenses to support product improvements and the development of new technologies. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

SG A expenses increased 60,267 to 1,933,410
during the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 1,873,143 during the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased
 185,797, or 5.5 , to 3,589,556 during the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 3,403,759 during the six months ended December
31, 2022. The increase in SG A was primarily due to increased personnel costs, increased travel-related expenses, increased stock-based
compensation and increases in our reserve for doubtful accounts. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the six months ended December 31, 2023,
cash on hand funded increases in inventory of 323,770 and a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 945,002, partially
offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 395,863. We also made payments of 277,912 on our term notes and capital leases. These
items, in addition to the impact of the quarterly net loss, net of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and other non-cash
items, resulted in a decrease of 1,938,808 in our cash and cash equivalents at December 31 2023 from 2,925,852 at June 30, 2023 to 987,044
at December 31, 2023. 

In October 2021 we entered a 2,600,000 term loan
with a commercial bank. In June 2023 we added a second term loan in the amount of 750,000. We secured a 250,000 line of credit from
the same bank in October 2021 for working capital needs, which was increased to 500,000 in May 2022 and to 1,250,000 in June 2023. There
were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit on December 31, 2023 and full availability in the amount of 1,250,000. 

Capital equipment expenditures and additional
patent costs during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and in the same period in the prior year were 170,772 and 37,637, respectively.
The increase was primarily attributable to the implementation of a new computer system. 

Contractual cash commitments for the fiscal periods
subsequent to December 31, 2023, are summarized as follows: 

Fiscal 2024 
 Thereafter 
 Total 
 
 Capital lease for equipment, including interest 
 24,309 
 77,792 
 102,101 
 
 Minimum operating lease payments 
 91,326 
 195,371 
 286,697 

16 

We have contractual cash commitments related to
open purchase orders as of December 31, 2023 of approximately 3,163,000. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intended to be designed to provide reasonable assurance
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.

Reporting
