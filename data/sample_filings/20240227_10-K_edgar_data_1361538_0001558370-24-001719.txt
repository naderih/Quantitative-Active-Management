 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Business Overview Primoris Services Corporation Primoris , the Company , we , us , or our is one of the leading providers of infrastructure services operating mainly in the United States and Canada. We provide a wide range of construction, maintenance, replacement, fabrication, and engineering services to a diversified base of customers through our two segments: Utilities and Energy. The structure of our reportable segments is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our services. We have longstanding customer relationships with utility, refining, petrochemical, power, renewable energy, communications, midstream, and engineering companies, and state departments of transportation. We provide our services to a diversified base of customers, under a range of contracting options. A portion of our services are provided under Master Service Agreements MSA ), which are generally multi-year agreements. The remainder of our services are generated from contracts for specific construction or installation projects. Reportable Segments Through the end of 2022, we segregated our business into three reportable segments: the Utilities segment, the Energy/Renewables segment, and the Pipeline segment. In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our reportable segments in connection with the realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these new segments. The current reportable segments include the Utilities segment and the Energy segment, which is made up of our former Energy/Renewables and Pipeline Services segments. The Utilities segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services, including the installation and maintenance of new and existing natural gas and electric utility distribution and transmission systems, and communications systems. The Energy segment operates throughout the United States and Canada and specializes in a range of services that include engineering, procurement, construction, retrofits, highway and bridge construction, demolition, site work, soil stabilization, mass excavation, flood control, upgrades, repairs, outages, pipeline construction and maintenance, pipeline integrity services, and maintenance services for entities in the renewable energy and energy storage, renewable fuels, and petroleum and petrochemical industries, as well as state departments of transportation.

 Acquisitions See Note 4 Business Combinations of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional detail. PLH Group, Inc. On August 1, 2022, we acquired PLH Group, Inc. PLH in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately 429.0 million, net of cash acquired (the PLH acquisition ). PLH is a utility-focused infrastructure services company with concentrations in growing regions of the United States. The transaction directly aligns with our strategic focus on higher-growth, higher margin markets and expands our capabilities in the power delivery, communications, and gas utilities markets. B Comm, LLC. On June 8, 2022, we acquired B Comm, LLC B Comm in an all-cash transaction for approximately 36.0 million, net of cash acquired. B Comm is a provider of maintenance, repair, upgrade and installation services to the communications markets. The transaction directly aligns with the strategy to grow our MSA revenue base and expand our communication services within the utility markets. Future Infrastructure Holdings, LLC. On January 15, 2021, we acquired Future Infrastructure Holdings, LLC FIH in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately 604.7 million, net of cash acquired. FIH is a provider of non-discretionary maintenance, repair, upgrade, and installation services to the communications, regulated gas utility, and infrastructure markets. FIH furthers our strategic plan to expand our service lines, enter new markets, and grow our MSA revenue base. The transaction directly aligns with our strategy to grow in large, higher growth, higher margin markets, and expands our utility services capabilities. Other acquisitions . In addition to these acquisitions, we have acquired other businesses as we continue to seek opportunities to deepen our market presence, broaden our geographic reach, and expand our service offerings. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates, especially those with strong management teams and growing end markets such as renewable energy, gas and electric utilities, and communications. Strategy Our strategy has remained consistent from year to year and continues to emphasize the following key elements: Growth Through Controlled Expansion. We continue to grow our Company by expanding our scope of services, leveraging our existing customer base to expand into new geographic markets, and adding new customers. In addition, we continue to evaluate acquisitions that offer growth opportunities and the ability to leverage our resources as a leading service provider to the energy, power, utility and communications industries. Our strategy also focuses on higher growth end markets such as renewable energy, utilities and communications. Emphasis on MSA Revenue Growth and Retention of Existing Customers. In order to fully leverage our relationships with our existing customer base, we believe it is important to maintain strong customer relationships in order to drive more revenue from them. We are also focused on expanding our base of services provided under MSAs, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide visible, recurring revenue. Ownership or Long-Term Leasing of Equipment. Many of our services are equipment intensive. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership or long-term leasing of a large and varied construction fleet and our maintenance facilities enhances our access to reliable equipment at a favorable cost. Stable Work Force. Our business model emphasizes self-performance of a significant portion of our work. In both of our segments, we maintain a stable work force of skilled, experienced craft professionals, many of whom are cross-trained on projects such as pipeline and facility construction, refinery maintenance, gas and electrical distribution, and piping systems.

 Selective Bidding. We selectively bid projects that we believe offer an opportunity to meet our profitability objectives and that may offer the opportunity to enter promising new markets. In addition, we review our bidding opportunities to attempt to minimize concentration of work with any one customer, in any one industry, or in stressed labor markets. We believe that by carefully positioning ourselves in market segments that have meaningful barriers of entry, we can continue to be competitive. Maintain a strong balance sheet and a conservative capital structure. We have maintained a capital structure that provides access to debt financing as needed while relying on strong operating cash flows to provide the primary support for our operations. We believe this structure provides our customers, our lenders, and our bonding companies assurance of our financial capabilities. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide letter of credit capability and, if needed, to augment our liquidity needs. Backlog Backlog is discussed in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Customers We have longstanding customer relationships with utility, refining, petrochemical, communications, midstream, downstream, and engineering companies, as well as independent power producers and transportation agencies across our core markets. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, major electrical and gas projects for large utility companies in the United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenue in any given year. We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from daily work orders to as long as 36 months, and occasionally longer, for completion on larger projects. We often provide services under long term MSAs, which are generally multi-year agreements for specific types of work. Work performed under these contracts is typically generated through project specific work orders, ranging from repairs and new installations, to maintenance and upgrade services. These MSAs have various terms, depending on the nature of the services provided, and our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs, although we do have MSAs that include minimum spend requirements, or targeted spend amounts. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue derived from projects performed under MSAs was 36.7 , 45.8 , and 45.9 , respectively. Our customers have included the Texas Department of Transportation and Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development in the Southern United States as well as many of the leading energy and utility companies in the United States, including, among others, Enterprise Pipeline, Xcel Energy, Pacific Gas Electric, Southern California Gas, Oncor Electric, Duke Energy, Sempra Energy, Williams, Hecate Energy, Consumers Energy, Dominion, Valero, Enel Green Power North America, ExxonMobil and Phillips 66. Our top ten customers vary from year to year due to the nature of our business. A large construction project for a customer may result in significant revenue in one year, with significantly less revenue in subsequent years after project completion. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 41.1 , 46.1 and 42.9 , respectively, of total revenue was generated from our top ten customers in each year. In each of the years, a different group of customers comprised the top ten customers by revenue. Management in each of our segments and business units is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our segment and business unit management teams work with our business development group to foster existing customer relationships and better understand their needs in order to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base. Segment and business unit managers are also responsible for working with our business development group in pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.

 We believe that developing and fostering strategic relationships with customers will result in increased future opportunities. Some of our strategic relationships are in the form of long-term MSAs. However, we realize that future opportunities also require cost effective, high value bids, as pricing is a key element for most construction projects and service agreements. Seasonality, Cyclicality and Variability Our results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, and named storms, which can impact our ability to perform construction and infrastructure services. These seasonal impacts can affect revenue and profitability in all of our businesses. Any quarter can be affected either negatively, or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects in our Utilities segment tends to be lower during the early part of the calendar year due to clients internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter. Our project values range in size from several hundred dollars to several hundred million dollars. The bulk of our work is comprised of project sizes that average less than 3.0 million. We also perform construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on customer timing, project duration, weather, and general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines, or delays in new projects, or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of our financial condition, or operating results for any other quarter, or for an entire year. Competition We face competition on large construction projects from both regional and national contractors, including competition from larger companies that have financial and other resources in excess of those available to us. Competitors on small construction projects range from a few large construction companies, to a variety of smaller contractors. We compete with many local and regional firms for construction services and with a number of large firms on select projects. Each business unit faces varied competition depending on the types of projects, project locations, and services offered. We compete with different companies in different end markets. For example, competitors in our utilities markets include Quanta Services, Inc. Dycom Industries, MYR Group, and MasTec, Inc.; competitors in our industrial markets include PCL, Kiewit, Granite Construction, Performance Contractors and Boh Brothers; competitors in the renewables market include Blattner Energy, and Mortenson; and competitors in our highway services markets include Sterling Construction Company and Zachry Construction Company. In each market we may also compete with local, private companies. We believe that the primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation for quality, safety, schedule certainty, relevant experience, availability of field supervision and skilled labor, machinery and equipment, financial strength, as well as knowledge of local markets and conditions. We believe that we have the ability to compete favorably in all of these factors. Contract Provisions and Subcontracting We typically structure contracts as unit-price, time and material, fixed-price or cost reimbursable plus fixed fee. A portion of our revenue is derived from MSAs, which provide a menu of available services that are utilized on an as-needed basis and are typically priced using a unit-price or on a time and material basis. The remainder of our services are generated from contracts for specific construction or installation projects, which are subject to multiple pricing options, including unit-price, time and material, fixed-price, or cost reimbursable plus fixed fee. Under a fixed-price contract, we provide labor, equipment and services required by a project for a competitively bid or negotiated fixed price. Under a unit-price contract, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a project at a fixed price per unit of work. While the unit-price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer, any increase in our unit cost over the unit price bid, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, faulty estimates or other factors, is borne by us. Significant materials required under a fixed-price or unit-price contract, such as pipe, turbines, boilers and vessels, are typically supplied by the customer.

Table of Contents 
 Substantially all of our gas and electric distribution services are provided pursuant to renewable MSAs on a unit-price basis. Fees on unit-price contracts are negotiated and earned based on units completed. Historically, substantially all of the gas and electric distribution customers have renewed their MSAs with us. Facility maintenance services, such as regularly scheduled and emergency repair work, are provided on an ongoing basis at predetermined rates, or on a time and material basis. Construction contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding or through negotiations with customers. We are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by customers who maintain pre-qualified contractor lists. Contractors are selected for the pre-approved contractor lists by virtue of their prior performance for such customers, as well as their experience, reputation for quality, safety record, financial strength, competitiveness, and bonding capacity. In evaluating bid opportunities, we consider such factors as the customer, the geographic location of the work, the availability of labor, our competitive advantage or disadvantage relative to other likely bidders, our current and projected workload, the likelihood of additional work, our history with the client, contract terms, and the project s cost and profitability estimates. We use sophisticated estimating systems and our estimating staff has significant experience in the construction industry. The project estimates form the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project cost system, thereby enabling management to monitor a project s cost and schedule performance. Project costs are accumulated and monitored regularly against billings and payments to ensure proper tracking of cash flow on the project. Most contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the owner or contractor. The terms associated with termination for convenience typically cover the reimbursement of all of our costs through a specific date, as well as all reasonable costs associated with demobilizing from the jobsite. In addition, contracts may be subject to certain completion schedule requirements which may include liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met. We act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the execution of the entire contract scope of work, including subcontract work. Thus, we are potentially subject to increased costs and reputational risks associated with the failure of one or more of our subcontractors to perform their respective scope as defined in the contract. While we subcontract specialized activities such as blasting, hazardous waste removal and selected electrical/instrumentation work, we self-perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources, including field supervision, labor, and equipment. Risk Management, Insurance and Bonding We maintain a comprehensive schedule of insurance policies covering a broad range of exposures arising from our construction and general business operations. All of our policies have been procured with limits and deductibles or self-insured retention amounts up to 1,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, we maintain certain self-insured retentions in our insurance policies in excess of our general and auto liability policies. We maintain a diligent safety and risk management program that has resulted in a favorable loss experience factor. Through our safety director and the employment of a large staff of regional and site-specific safety managers, we have been able to effectively assess and control potential losses and liabilities in both the pre-construction and performance phases of our projects. Though we strongly focus on safety in the workplace, we cannot give assurances that we can prevent or reduce all injuries and/or claims in our workplace. In connection with our business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds guaranteeing our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, backlog, past performance, management expertise and other factors, and the surety company s current underwriting standards. To date, we have obtained the level of surety bonds necessary to support our business.

Table of Contents 
 Regulation and Environmental Requirements Our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state, and municipal agencies and authorities, and international laws and regulations including with respect to: Licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; Worker safety, including regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; Wage and hour regulations and regulations associated with our collective bargaining agreements and unionized workforce; Transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements, as well as aviation activities; Building and electrical codes; Applicable U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption regulations; Immigration regulations applicable to the U.S. and cross-border employment; Labor relations and affirmative action; Special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects; and Protection of the environment, including regulations established by the Environmental Protection Agency, state agencies and other foreign environmental regulators. We believe that we have all the licenses and permits required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes diesel fuel, which could be negatively impacted by regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions from such sources. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under some of these laws and regulations, liability can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or leased properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current, or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge, or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations, or affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws. While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance these requirements will not change, and compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. In addition, tighter regulation for the protection of the environment and other factors may make it more difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist. Climate Change-Related Impacts Our management considers climate-related risks and opportunities in connection with its long-term strategic planning and enterprise risk management process. While the overall impact on our operations continues to evolve, various aspects of climate change, as well as market and societal concerns about the future impact of climate change, have resulted and are expected to continue to result in operational opportunities and challenges. These opportunities and challenges arise from the physical risks associated with changes in climate, as well as technological advances, market developments and additional regulatory and compliance costs. Our operating results can be significantly influenced by the climates in which we operate as well as severe weather events. Changes in climate could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas, which may enable us to increase our productivity in those areas. Physical risks associated with climate change have also increased hazards associated with certain of our operations, which in turn has increased the potential for liability and increased the costs associated with such operations. Additionally, new legislation or regulation related to 
 9 

Table of Contents 
 climate change could increase our costs. However, due to climate change risks some utility customers are transitioning toward more sustainable sources of power generation, such as renewables, which can provide additional opportunities for our Energy segment. For additional information regarding the risks and opportunities described above, see Risks Related to Operating Our Business in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital Management Employee Profile. We believe that our employees are vital to successfully completing our projects. Our ability to maintain sufficient, continuous work for hourly employees helps us to maintain a stable, loyal workforce with an understanding of our policies and culture, which contributes to our strong performance, safety and quality record. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. In addition, we have partnerships with technical schools where we recruit and hire craft employees. Several of our subsidiaries have operations that are unionized through the negotiation and execution of collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 30.6 of our hourly employees, primarily consisting of field laborers, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration. We have not experienced recent work stoppages and believe our employee and union relations are good. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 2,773 salaried employees and 11,285 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel employed is subject to the volume of infrastructure services and construction work in progress. Diversity and Inclusion . We employ a dynamic mix of people to create the strongest company possible. Our policy prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race or religion. We are an inclusive, diverse company with people of all backgrounds, experiences, cultures, styles and talents. We have a Diversity and Inclusion committee whose goal is to identify and advance efforts that aim to create and foster a workplace that is reflective of, and contributes to, the diverse communities in which we do business. The committee promotes awareness of diversity and inclusion issues in support of company-wide efforts to build a more inclusive and diverse workplace. Professional and Career Development. We strive to develop and sustain a skilled labor advantage by providing thorough on-and off-site training programs, project management training, and leadership development programs. We have company-owned training facilities that support continuous skills training, including several locations where we train electric apprentices to become journeymen. We offer multiple levels of leadership programs designed to meet the needs of our employees and support the development of best-in-class talent. Our five cornerstone programs are Foreman Foundations, Extreme Ownership, Hunt for Leadership Success, Next Level Leadership, and The Leadership Experience. From Foreman Foundations where employees learn the fundamentals of transitioning from a crew member to a crew leader through The Leadership Experience where emerging leaders explore values-based leadership and sharpen their strategic leadership skills, our Learning and Development programs are designed to support Primoris vision, mission, and values and promote the growth of our greatest assets, our employees. Safety, Health and Wellness . We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees, and we pride ourselves on above average workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews monthly, and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a strong safety culture. Lost Time Injury Rate LTIR tracks the rate of injuries in the workplace which results in the employee having to take a minimum of one full working day away from work. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our LTIR rate was 0.07 compared to an industry average of 1.0 per the U.S. Bureau of Labor construction industry statistics. Total Recordable Incident Rate TRIR tracks the total number of workplace injuries which rise to the level of Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordability, whether leading to time away from work or not. TRIR is reported as the number of workplace safety incidents per 100 full-time workers during a one-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our TRIR rate was 0.46 compared to an industry average of 2.4 per the U.S. Bureau of Labor construction industry statistics.

 Compensation and Benefits. As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. Our compensation programs are generally designed to align employee compensation with market practices and our performance. With respect to our executive officers, business unit management, and other senior leadership, compensation programs consist of both fixed and variable components. The fixed portion is generally set at market levels, with variable compensation designed to reward employees based on company and individual performance. In connection with these compensation programs, we grant stock-based compensation to management and key personnel at the business unit levels, which we believe helps to align incentives throughout our organization. We also enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key personnel. For additional information regarding our executive compensation, please see the information required in Item 11 Executive Compensation, which will be incorporated by reference from our definitive proxy statement related to our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We also provide additional benefits to our non-union employees, including a Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs. Code of Conduct. All of our employees are subject to our Code of Conduct, which includes guidance and requirements concerning, among other things, general business ethics, including policies concerning the environment, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption, harassment and discrimination, data security and privacy, insider trading and the Anti-Bribery Corruption Policy, which includes guidance and requirements concerning, among other things, interactions with government officials; provision of gifts, entertainment and hospitality; and charitable and political contributions.

 The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, the results of our operations, our financial condition, our cash flow and the price of our shares. These risk factors could prevent us from meeting our goals or expectations. Risks Related Primarily to Operating our Business Our financial and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our business is subject to seasonal and annual fluctuations. Some of the quarterly variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, and named storms, which create difficult operating conditions. Similarly, demand for routine repair and maintenance services for gas utilities is lower during their peak customer needs in the winter, and demand for routine repair and maintenance services for electric utilities is lower during their peak customer needs in the summer. Some of the annual variation is the result of construction projects which fluctuate based on customer timing, project duration, weather, and general economic conditions. Annual and quarterly results may also be adversely affected by: Changes in our mix of customers, projects, contracts and business; Regional or national and/or general economic conditions and demand for our services; Variations and changes in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter; Increases in the costs to perform services caused by changing conditions; The termination, or expiration of existing agreements or contracts; The budgetary spending patterns of customers; Increases in construction costs, including due to inflation or supply chain challenges, that we may be unable to pass through to our customers; Cost or schedule overruns on fixed-price contracts; Availability of qualified labor for specific projects; Changes in bonding requirements and bonding availability for existing and new agreements; The need and availability of letters of credit; Costs we incur to support growth, whether organic or through acquisitions; The timing and volume of work under contract; and Losses experienced in our operations. As a result, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other quarter, or for an entire year. Demand for our services may decrease during economic recessions or volatile economic cycles, and a reduction in demand in end markets may adversely affect our business. A substantial portion of our revenue and profit is generated from construction projects, the awarding of which we do not directly control. The engineering and construction industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recessions, downturns in business cycles of our customers, material shortages, price increases by subcontractors, interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control. When the general level of economic activity deteriorates, our customers may delay, or cancel upgrades, expansions, and/or maintenance and repairs to their systems. Many factors, including the financial condition of the industry, could adversely affect our customers and their willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future. Economic, political, regulatory and market conditions affecting our specific end markets may adversely impact the demand for our services, resulting in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects and these conditions may continue to adversely affect us in the future. For example, much of the work that we perform in the highway markets involves funding by federal, state and local governments. This funding is subject to fluctuation based on the budgets and operating priorities of the various government agencies. We are also dependent on the amount of work our customers outsource. In a slower economy, our customers may decide to outsource less infrastructure services, reducing demand for our services. In addition, consolidation, competition or capital constraints in the industries we serve may result in reduced spending by our customers.

 Many of our customers are regulated by federal and state government agencies and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact demand for our services and the profitability of those services. Many of our energy customers are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC ), and our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions. These agencies could change the way in which they interpret current regulations and may impose additional regulations. These changes could have an adverse effect on our customers and the profitability of the services they provide, which could reduce demand for our services or delay our ability to complete projects. Additionally, our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities. The demand for our pipeline construction services is dependent on the level of operating and capital project spending by midstream companies in the oil and gas industry and industrial companies primarily in the petrochemical industry. This level of spending is subject to large fluctuations depending primarily on the current price, volatility, and expectations of future prices of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The price is a function of many factors, including levels of supply and demand, government policies and regulations, oil industry refining capacity and the potential development of alternative fuels. Specific government decisions could affect demand for our construction services. For example, limitations on the use of fracking technology, creation of significant regulatory issues for the construction of underground pipelines and permitting and licensing requirements have reduced our underground work. Conversely, government regulations may increase the demand for our pipeline services. Recent pipeline safety legislation could increase demand for our pipeline facility, maintenance, integrity and repair services. Our business may be materially adversely impacted by regional, national and/or global requirements related to climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Greenhouse gases that result from human activities, including burning of fossil fuels, are the focus of increased scientific and political scrutiny and may be subject to changing legal requirements. International agreements, federal laws, state laws and various regulatory schemes to limit or otherwise regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, and additional restrictions are under consideration by different governmental entities. We derive a small portion of our revenue and contract profit from engineering and construction services to clients that own and/or operate a wide range of process plants and own and/or operate electric power generating plants that generate electricity from burning natural gas or various types of solid fuels. These plants emit greenhouse gases as part of the process to generate electricity or other products. Compliance with existing greenhouse gas regulation may prove costly or difficult. It is possible that owners and operators of existing or future process plants and electric generating plants could be subject to new or changed environmental regulations that result in significantly limiting, or reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the cost of emitting such gases or requiring emissions allowances. The costs of controlling such emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances could be significant. It also is possible that necessary controls or allowances may not be available. Such regulations could negatively impact client investments in capital projects in our markets, which could negatively impact the market for our products and/or services. The establishment of additional rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions could also impact our ability to perform construction services, or to perform these services with current levels of profitability. New regulations may require us to acquire different equipment or change processes. The new equipment may not be available, or it may not be purchased or rented in a cost-effective manner. Project deferrals, delays or cancellations resulting from the potential regulations could adversely impact our business. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to a revocation of our licenses or permits. Our contracts with our customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to certain of our job sites or properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with our environmental obligations.

 While the potential impact of climate-related changes, including legislative and regulatory responses thereto, on our operations is uncertain, management considers climate-related risks and opportunities in connection with its long-term strategic planning and short-term deployment of resources. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather, and major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our operating results. Concerns about the impact of climate change have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in technological advancements and market developments that impact our business. For example, utility customers are transitioning toward more sustainable sources of power generation, such as renewables, which can provide additional opportunities for our Energy segment. Additionally, increased electrification of new technologies may lead to continued and additional demand for new and expanded electric power infrastructure and reengineering of existing electric power infrastructure. However, concerns about climate change could also result in potential new regulations, regulatory actions or requirements to fund energy efficiency activities, as well as decreased demand for refined products, which in turn could negatively impact our customers and demand for certain of our pipeline, underground utility and infrastructure services. Climate change could also affect our customers and the types of projects that they award. Demand for power projects, underground pipelines or highway projects could be affected by significant changes in weather, or climate conditions, or by regulatory changes relating to climate change, which could in turn reduce demand for our services. Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, or the operations of one or more of our vendors or customers, and could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could cause our customers to delay or cancel projects, which could impact our ability to operate. In addition, these types of events could lead to general inefficiencies from having to start and stop work, re-sequencing work or modifying our customary work practices. Changes to renewable portfolio standards and decreased demand for renewable energy projects could negatively impact our future results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. A significant portion of our future business may be focused on providing construction and/or installation services to owners and operators of solar power and other renewable energy facilities. Currently, the development of solar and other renewable energy facilities is dependent on the existence of renewable portfolio standards and other state incentives and requirements. Renewable portfolio standards are state-specific statutory provisions requiring or encouraging that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. These standards have initiated significant growth in the renewable energy industry and increased demand for renewable energy infrastructure construction services. Elimination of, or changes to, existing renewable portfolio standards, tax credits or similar environmental policies may negatively affect future demand for our services. We may lose business to competitors through the competitive bidding processes. We are engaged in highly competitive businesses in which most customer contracts are awarded through bidding processes based on price and the acceptance of certain risks, along with other factors. We compete with other infrastructure services contractors, both regional and national, as well as small local contractors. The strong competition in our markets requires maintaining skilled personnel and investing in technology, and puts pressure on profit margins. We do not obtain contracts from all of our bids and our inability to win bids at acceptable profit margins would adversely affect our business.

 We may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth which may affect our ability to expand our operations or grow our business. Our ability to generate internal growth may be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: Attract new customers; Increase the number of projects performed for existing customers; Hire and retain qualified personnel; Secure appropriate levels of construction equipment; Successfully bid for new projects; and Adapt the range of services we offer to address our customers evolving construction needs. In addition, our customers may reduce the number or size of projects available to us due to their inability to obtain capital. Our customers may also reduce projects in response to economic conditions. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business. The timing of new contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in our business. Substantial portions of our revenue are derived from project-based work that is awarded through a competitive bid process. The portion of revenue generated from the competitive bid process for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately 30.1 , 26.3 , and 31.2 , respectively. It is generally very difficult to predict the timing and geographic distribution of the projects that we will be awarded. The selection of, timing of or failure to obtain projects, delays in award of projects, the re-bidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether or when work will begin. For example, some of our contracts are subject to financing, permitting and other contingencies that may delay or result in termination of projects. We may have difficulty in matching workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a ready workforce and equipment that is larger than necessary, resulting in unpredictability in our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If any expected contract award, or the related work release is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenue. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects will reduce our revenue and earnings if these projects have not been replaced. We derive a meaningful portion of our revenue from a few customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could have significant effects on our revenue, resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customer base is reasonably concentrated, with our top ten customers accounting for approximately 41.1 of our revenue in 2023, 46.1 of our revenue in 2022 and 42.9 of our revenue in 2021. However, the customers included in our top ten customer list generally vary from year to year. Our revenue is dependent both on performance of larger construction projects and relatively smaller projects under MSAs. For the large construction projects, the completion of the project does not necessarily represent the permanent loss of a customer; however, the future revenue generated from work for that customer may fluctuate significantly. We also generate ongoing revenue from our MSA customers, which are generally comprised of regulated gas and electric utilities. If we were to lose one of these customers, our revenue could decline. Reduced demand for our services by larger construction customers or a loss of a significant MSA customer could have an adverse effect on our business.

 Our international operations expose us to legal, political and economic risks in different countries as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our business and financial results. We could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with laws applicable to our foreign activities, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue attributable to our services outside of the United States, principally in Canada, was 5.8 , 6.7 and 4.5 of our total revenue, respectively. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: Imposition of governmental controls and changes in laws, regulations, policies, practices, tariffs and taxes; Political and economic instability; Changes in United States and other national government trade policies affecting the market for our services; Potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar non-United States laws and regulations; Currency exchange rate fluctuations, devaluations and other conversion restrictions; Restrictions on or fees or taxes associated with repatriating foreign profit back to the United States; and Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. We require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws. There is no assurance that our policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged FCPA violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Backlog may not be realized or may not result in revenue or profit. Backlog is measured and defined differently by companies within our industry. We refer to backlog as our anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value, and the estimated revenue on MSA work. We present two measures of backlog; one that includes fixed backlog and estimated revenue on MSA work for the next four quarters, and total backlog that includes all fixed backlog and estimated revenue on MSA work to the end of the MSA agreement. We do not consider renewals when estimating total backlog. Backlog is not a comprehensive indicator of future revenue. Most contracts may be terminated by our customers on short notice. Reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer, or for other reasons, could significantly reduce the revenue that we actually receive from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancellation, we are typically reimbursed for all of our costs through a specific date, as well as all reasonable costs associated with demobilizing from the jobsite, but we typically have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time. While backlog includes estimated MSA revenue, customers are not contractually obligated to purchase a certain amount of services under the MSA. Given these factors, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year. Inability to realize revenue from our backlog could have an adverse effect on our business. While backlog may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn the following fiscal year, it is a potential indicator of future revenue; however, recognition of revenue from backlog does not necessarily ensure that the projects will be profitable. Poor project execution could impact profit from contracts included in backlog. For projects for which 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 a loss is expected, future revenue will be recorded with no margin, which may reduce the overall margin percentage for work performed. Our actual cost may be greater than expected in performing our contracts causing us to realize significantly lower profit or losses on our projects. We currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a substantial portion of our revenue from fixed price and unit price contracts. The actual cost of labor and materials may vary from the costs we originally estimated, and we may not be successful in recouping additional costs from our customers. These variations may cause gross profit for a project to differ from those we originally estimated. Reduced profitability or losses on projects could occur due to changes in a variety of factors such as: Failure to properly estimate costs of engineering, materials, equipment or labor; Unanticipated technical problems with the structures, materials or services being supplied by us, which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem; Project modifications not reimbursed by the client creating unanticipated costs; Changes in the costs of equipment, materials, labor or subcontractors; Our suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform; Changes in local laws and regulations, and; Delays caused by weather conditions. As projects grow in size and complexity, multiple factors may contribute to reduced profit or losses, and depending on the size of the particular project, variations from the estimated contract costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Weather can significantly affect our revenue and profitability. Our ability to perform work and meet customer schedules can be affected by weather conditions such as snow, ice, rain, and named storms. Weather may affect our ability to work efficiently and can cause project delays and additional costs. Our ability to negotiate change orders for the impact of weather on a project could impact our profitability. In addition, the impact of weather can cause significant variability in our quarterly revenue and profitability. We require subcontractors and suppliers to assist us in providing certain services, and we may be unable to retain the necessary subcontractors or obtain supplies to complete certain projects which could adversely affect our business. We use subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts and to manage workflow. While we are not dependent on any single subcontractor, general market conditions may limit the availability of subcontractors to perform portions of our contracts causing delays and increasing our costs. Although significant materials are often supplied by the customer, we use suppliers to provide some materials and equipment used for projects. If a supplier fails to provide supplies and equipment at the estimated price, fails to provide adequate amounts of supplies and equipment, fails to provide supplies or equipment that meet the project requirements, or fails to provide supplies when scheduled, we may be required to source the supplies or equipment at a higher price or may be required to delay performance of the project. The additional cost or project delays could negatively impact project profitability. Failure of a subcontractor or supplier to comply with laws, rules or regulations could negatively affect our reputation and our business.

 We periodically enter into joint ventures which require satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their obligations. The failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose additional financial and performance obligations on us that could result in reduced profit or losses for us with respect to the joint venture. We periodically enter into various joint ventures and teaming arrangements where control may be shared with unaffiliated third parties. At times, we also participate in joint ventures where we are not a controlling party. In such instances, we may have limited control over joint venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting which may have an impact on our business. If our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their joint venture obligations, the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments or provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. These additional obligations could result in reduced profit and may impact our reputation in the industry. We may experience delays and defaults in client payments and we may pay our suppliers and subcontractors before receiving payment from our customers for the related services, which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We use subcontractors and material suppliers for portions of certain work, and our customers pay us for those related services. If we pay our suppliers and subcontractors for materials purchased and work performed for customers who fail to pay us, or such customers delay paying us for the related work or materials, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if customers fail to pay us for work we perform, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business. Our inability to recover on contract modifications against project owners for payment or performance could negatively affect our business. We periodically present contract modifications to our clients for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract modifications for which customers have not agreed to both scope and price. We consider claims to be contract modifications for which we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers, or others, for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers. Claims can also be caused by non-customer-caused changes, such as rain or other weather delays. In some cases, settlement of contract modifications may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. A failure to promptly document and negotiate a recovery for contract modifications could have a negative impact on our cash flows, and an overall ability to recover contract modifications could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For some projects we may guarantee a timely completion or provide a performance guarantee which could result in additional costs, such as liquidated damages, to cover our obligations. In our fixed-price and unit-price contracts we may provide a project completion date, and in some of our projects we may commit that the project will achieve specific performance standards. Failure to complete the project as scheduled or at the contracted performance standards could result in additional costs or penalties, including liquidated damages, and such amounts could exceed expected project profit. A significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds, and we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds. Our contracts frequently require that we provide payment and performance bonds to our customers. Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing, or renewing bonds. Current or future market conditions, as well as changes in our surety providers assessments of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew, or to substantially reduce, the availability of bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, our alternatives would include seeking bonding 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 capacity from other sureties, finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for, or work on certain projects. Our bonding requirements may limit our ability to incur indebtedness, which would limit our ability to refinance our existing credit facilities or to execute our business plan. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon various factors including our capitalization, working capital, tangible net worth and amount of our indebtedness. In order to obtain required bonds, we may be limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness that may be needed to refinance our existing credit facilities upon maturity, to complete acquisitions, and to otherwise execute our business plans. We may be unable to win some new contracts if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit. For many of our clients surety bonds provide an adequate form of security, but for some clients security in the form of a letter of credit may be required. While we have capacity for letters of credit under our credit facility, the amount required by a client may be in excess of our credit limit. Any such amount would be issued at the sole discretion of our lenders. Failure to provide a letter of credit when required by a client may result in our inability to compete for, win, or retain a project. During the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to material lawsuits or indemnity claims. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, cyber-security and related incidents, property damage, punitive damages, and civil penalties, or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them, and, in some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers, or other third parties. Because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers infrastructure, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems on which we work, even if our services are not the cause of such failures, and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage, personal injury or system failure. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management s attention from the business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could adversely affect our reputation, our cash flows, and our business. We are self-insured up to certain limits. Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer s liability, general liability, auto and workers compensation claims, those policies are subject to deductibles or self-insured retention amounts up to 1,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, for our employees not part of a collective bargaining agreement, we provide employee health care benefit plans. Our primary health insurance plan is subject to a deductible of 425,000 per individual claim per year. Our insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice. If we fail to comply with these requirements, our coverage could be denied. Losses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance based on the potential benefits

 considered relative to the cost of such insurance, or coverage may not be available at reasonable and competitive rates. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business is labor intensive. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, our operating costs may increase. Our business is labor intensive and our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability may be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We may not be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy. We have from time-to-time experienced, and may in the future experience, shortages of certain types of qualified personnel. For example, periodically there are shortages of engineers, project managers, field supervisors, and other skilled workers capable of working on and supervising the construction of underground, electric utilities, heavy civil and industrial facilities, as well as providing engineering services. The supply of experienced engineers, project managers, field supervisors, journeyman linemen and other skilled workers may not be sufficient to meet current or expected demand. The beginning of new, large-scale infrastructure projects, or increased competition for workers currently available to us, could affect our business, even if we are not awarded such projects. Labor shortages, or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenue. If we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses. Our unionized workforce may commence work stoppages or impact our ability to complete certain acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operations. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 30.6 of our hourly employees, primarily consisting of field laborers, were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future. Strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons. For instance, in certain geographic areas, our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire, and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union company. Withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans associated with our unionized workforce could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our collective bargaining agreements generally require that we participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ), as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 MEPA ), may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them, or if they are terminated. In addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules for multiemployer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. For a plan in critical status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions may apply if a plan is determined to be underfunded, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For plans in critical status, we may be required to make additional contributions, generally in the form of surcharges on contributions otherwise required. Participation in those plans with high funding levels could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if we are not able to adequately mitigate these costs. The amount of the withdrawal liability legislated by ERISA and MEPA varies for every pension plan to which we contribute. For each plan, our potential liability is the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan multiplied by a fraction: the numerator of the fraction is the sum of our contributions to the plan for the past ten years and the denominator is the sum of all contributions made by all employers for the past ten years. For some pension plans to which we contribute, the total unfunded vested benefits for the entire plan could be in the billions of dollars. If we cannot reduce the alleged fractional exposure through exemptions or negotiations, the withdrawal from a plan could have a material adverse impact on our business.

 We depend on key personnel and we may not be able to operate and grow our business effectively if we lose the services of any of our key persons or are unable to attract qualified and skilled personnel in the future. We are dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, and our ability to retain them and hire other qualified employees. The loss of our executive officers, or other key personnel could affect our ability to run our business effectively. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may not be able to retain our personnel. The loss of any key person requires the remaining key personnel to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement, as well as to performing the departed person s responsibilities until a replacement is found. In addition, as some of our key persons approach retirement age, we need to provide for smooth transitions. If we fail to find a suitable replacement for any departing executive or senior officer on a timely basis, such departure could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business. If we fail to integrate acquisitions successfully, we may experience operational challenges and risks which may have an adverse effect on our business. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire companies that expand, complement or diversify our business. Acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including, among others: The diversion of management s attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined company; Managing a significantly larger company than before completion of an acquisition; The assimilation of new employees and the integration of business cultures; Training and facilitating our internal control processes within the acquired organization; Retaining key personnel; The integration of information, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems; Challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; Challenges in combining service offerings and sales and marketing activities; The assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves; The potential impairment of acquired goodwill and intangible assets; and The inability to enforce covenants not to compete. Failure to effectively manage the integration process could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We may incur higher costs on equipment necessary for our operations. A significant portion of our contracts is built utilizing our own construction equipment rather than rented equipment. To the extent that we are unable to buy or lease equipment necessary for a project, either due to a lack of available funding, or equipment shortages in the marketplace, we may be forced to rent equipment on a short-term basis, or to find alternative ways to perform the work without the benefit of equipment ideally suited for the job, which could increase the costs of completing the project. We often bid for work knowing that we will have to rent equipment on a short-term basis, and we include the equipment rental rates in our bid. If market rates for rental equipment increase between the time of bid submission and project execution, our margins for the project may be reduced. In addition, our equipment requires regular maintenance, which we generally provide through our own repair facilities. If we are unable to maintain the equipment in our fleet, we may be forced to obtain additional third-party repair services at a higher cost or be unable to bid on contracts. Our business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments which may adversely affect our ability to procure materials and labor. We perform our work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, difficult and hard to reach terrain, difficult site conditions, and busy urban centers, where delivery of materials and availability of labor may be impacted. Performing work under these conditions can slow our progress, potentially causing us to incur contractual liability to our customers. These difficult conditions may also cause us to incur additional, unanticipated costs that we might not be able to pass on to our customers.

 We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our environmental, health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions, we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future. Serious accidents, including fatalities, may subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business. Disruptions to our operational systems could adversely impact our operations, our ability to report financial results and our business. We rely on computer, information and communication technology and related systems to operate our business and to protect confidential, sensitive company, customer and partner information. Our computer and communications systems, and consequently our operations, could be damaged or interrupted by cyber-attacks and physical security risks, such as natural disasters, loss of power, communications failures, acts of war, acts of terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and actions by hackers and cyber-terrorists. Any of these, or similar, events could cause system disruptions, delays and loss of critical information, delays in processing transactions and delays in the reporting of financial information. Security breaches, cyber security attacks or other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks could adversely impact our operations or compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our own proprietary information. Any cyber security attack (including denial of service attacks, ransomware, phishing attacks, payment fraud or others) that affects our facilities, our systems, our partners, our customers or any of our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and services. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware, software and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, service providers, suppliers, customers, counterparties or other financial intermediaries. Such third parties who provide us services or with whom we communicate could also be the source of a cyberattack on, or breach of, our operational systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology systems and networked and connected products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors or others who have access to these systems and products. Any of these events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. We have experienced cyber security threats, such as viruses and attacks targeting our systems, and expect the frequency and sophistication of such incidents will continue to increase. Such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future threats or existing threats of which we are not yet aware could cause harm to our business and our reputation, disrupt our operations, expose us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business, and impact our results of operations materially. We also currently maintain a cyber insurance policy; however, such insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.

 While we have taken steps to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats by implementing network security and internal control measures, implementing policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, periodically testing our information technology systems, and conducting employee training on cyber security, a system or network failure or data security breach could have negative consequences for our company, customers, or partners and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. To the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements. We may need additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, and we may not be able to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives. Our ability to generate cash is essential for the funding of our operations and the servicing of our debt. If existing cash balances together with the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities were not sufficient to make future investments, make acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend on a number of factors including prevailing capital market conditions, conditions in our industry, and our operating results. These factors may affect our ability to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. If additional funds were not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or pursue other opportunities. Risks Related Primarily to the Financial Accounting of our Business Our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, many estimates and assumptions are used in determining the reported revenue, costs and expenses recognized during the periods presented, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our assessments of the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities, accounting for revenue recognized over time, and provisions for income taxes. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we used. Our accounting for revenue recognized over time could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported revenue and profit. For contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value, we recognize revenue over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer (typically using an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress). Accounting for long-term contracts involves the use of various techniques to estimate total transaction price and costs. For long-term contracts, transaction price, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenue earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenue and income, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation, and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion, and thus the timing of revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. In certain circumstances, it is possible that such adjustments could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our business.

 Our reported results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of impairments of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. When we acquire a business, we record an asset called goodwill for the excess amount we pay for the business over the net fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the business we acquire. At December 31, 2023, our balance sheet included goodwill of 857.7 million and intangible assets of 227.6 million resulting from previous acquisitions. Fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Under current accounting rules, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, while identifiable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives. Significant judgment is required in completing these tests, as described in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any impairment of goodwill, or identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the various acquisitions, or for any future acquisitions, would negatively impact our results of operations. Compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance. We are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including federal, state, local and international jurisdictions. New tax laws, treaties and regulations and changes in existing tax laws, treaties and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed and could result in a different tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow from operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, as described in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Income Taxes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity. Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. From time to time, we may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, 300.0 million of our variable rate debt outstanding was economically hedged. The remaining 574.1 million of variable rate debt was unhedged. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, will decrease correspondingly. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, a 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately 5.7 million. Risks Related to our Common Stock Our common stock is subject to potential dilution to our stockholders. As part of our acquisition strategy, we have issued and used shares of common stock as a part of contingent earn-out consideration, which have resulted in dilution to our stockholders. Our Certificate of Incorporation permits us to issue up to 90.0 million shares of common stock of which approximately 53.4 million were outstanding at December 31, 2023. While New York Stock Exchange rules require that we obtain stockholder approval to issue more than 20 additional shares, stockholder approval is not required below that level. In addition, we can issue shares of preferred stock which could cause further dilution to the stockholder, resulting in reduced net income and cash flow available to common stockholders. In 2022, our stockholders adopted the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ), under which eligible full-time employees can purchase shares of our common stock at a discount on a semi-annual basis. The number of shares authorized and available for purchase under the ESPP is 1.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 977,000 shares of common stock remaining available for purchase. Additional purchases made under the ESPP will have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and stockholders percentage of ownership. In 2023, our stockholders adopted our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan 2023 Equity Plan ). The 2023 Equity Plan replaced a previous plan. The Equity Plan authorized the Board of Directors to issue equity awards totaling 6.5 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2023, there were 6.2 million shares of common stock remaining available for issuance under our 2023 Equity Plan. Equity awards made to our directors and employees will have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and stockholders percentage of ownership. Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change in control. As a Delaware corporation, anti-takeover provisions may impose an impediment to the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be of benefit to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws also may impose an impediment or discourage others from a takeover. These provisions include: restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting, or nominate a director for election and our Board of Directors ability to authorize the issuance of preferred shares. These types of provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to obtain a premium for their shares. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We rely on computer, information, network, and communication technology and related systems to operate our business and to protect confidential, restricted, and sensitive company, customer, and partner information. We have a multi-layered cybersecurity risk management program designed to identify risks related to the organization s digital and physical assets, review and assess existing security measures, and implement and manage solutions to mitigate cyber risks. These solutions are designed to protect our facilities, our systems, our partners, our customers, and our financial data in case we experience a cyber incident. Protection includes phishing detection, social engineering, executive targeting, brand impersonation, configuration mistakes, sensitive data leakage, leaked credentials, malicious attacks, third-party risks, vulnerabilities, insider threats (both intentional and unintentional), and password attacks. This type of ongoing vulnerability risk management is crucial as the organization and the external threat landscape evolves. This cybersecurity risk management program is incorporated as part of the Primoris Enterprise Risk Management Program. Our cybersecurity policies and processes are based on the controls within the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Framework, and we engage a number of external parties to enhance our cybersecurity oversight. For example, every other year, a third-party consulting firm performs an assessment of our cyber program, measuring our program against the NIST controls with a Capability Maturity Model Integration overlay to determine the program s maturity. The assessment findings are disclosed to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and our cross-functional management Security Steering Committee SSC ). Any improvements resulting from the assessment are identified, along with action plans. We also use a third party to perform an annual Breach Assessment targeting our external and internal network environment to determine the strengths and any weaknesses within our cybersecurity processes. As part of the Breach Assessment, our Incident Response Plan is instigated and reviewed to ensure it remains current and effective for all situations. We also have multiple third-party managed Security Operations Centers SOC in place; including a SOC for logging and monitoring of security events; a SOC for endpoint managed detection and response, including identity protection; a SOC for executive digital and brand protection; and a SOC for protection of network credentials. In order to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the Company s use of vendors and other third-party service providers, we conduct continuous passive scanning of the Primoris network, as well as Primoris vendors external perimeter, on a regular basis to assess any potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

 We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, could materially affect us, including our business operations, results of operations or financial condition. Cybersecurity Governance and Oversight The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors provides direct oversight over cybersecurity risk and governance. We also maintain a cross-functional management Security Steering Committee SSC ), with members consisting of executive leadership, internal audit, and enterprise risk. The SSC meets quarterly and has a formal charter outlining its responsibility to provide oversite of our comprehensive cybersecurity program. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is briefed quarterly by the Chief Information Officer CIO on the cybersecurity program, and both the Audit Committee and SSC are notified between such updates regarding significant new cybersecurity threats or incidents. The full Board of Directors also receives regular reports from the Audit Committee. The CIO chairs the SSC and oversees Primoris cybersecurity risk management program. The CIO is supported by the head of cybersecurity, who is a direct report to the CIO. The training and experience of the head of cybersecurity includes a Harvard MBA along with professional experiences involving Forensics and Investigation, NIST controls assessments and implementation, ISO27001 assessments and implementation, Payment Card Industry Certification, and HITRUST implementation and certification. The head of cybersecurity and the security team are responsible for leading company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, and processes and work across the organization to assess and prepare Primoris to address cybersecurity risks. Our head of cybersecurity and the security team are informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents pursuant to our Incident Response Plan. Our employees are also an important part of protecting our digital and technical environment. A key area of the cybersecurity program is the education of employees regarding cybersecurity using security awareness training, security bulletins and phishing simulations to reinforce training on a quarterly basis. Security awareness training covers all network users. On an annual basis an Acceptable Use Policy AUP is distributed to employees through our Learning Management System for understanding and acknowledgement. Additionally, all new employees are provided the AUP by Human Resources and receive initial security training upon being granted access to our network. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Facilities We lease our executive offices in Dallas, Texas and own and lease other facilities throughout the United States and Canada. Our facilities include offices, production yards, maintenance shops, and training and education facilities that are used in our operations. As of December 31, 2023, we owned 54 of our facilities and leased the remainder. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our current and foreseeable requirements. Property, Plant and Equipment The construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue making capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. In 2023, capital expenditures were approximately 103.0 million. Total construction equipment purchases in 2023 were 34.0 million. We believe the ownership or long-term leasing of equipment is generally preferable to renting to ensure the equipment is available as needed. In addition, this approach has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs. All equipment is subject to scheduled maintenance to help ensure reliability. Maintenance facilities exist at most of our regional offices, as well as on-site on major projects to properly service and repair equipment. Major equipment not currently utilized is rented to third parties or sold whenever possible.

The following graph compares the cumulative total return to holders of our common stock during the five-year period from December 31, 2018, and in each quarter up through December 31, 2023. The return is compared to the cumulative total return during the same period achieved on the Standard Poor s 500 Stock Index (the S P 500 and a peer group index selected by our management that includes five public companies within our industry (the Peer Group ). The companies in the Peer Group were selected because they comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations, each of which has some operations similar to ours. When taken as a whole, management believes the Peer Group more closely resembles our total business than any individual company in the group. The Peer Group is composed of MasTec, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Sterling Construction Company, Inc. and Granite Construction, Inc. The Peer Group was modified in 2023 to replace Quanta Services, Inc. and Matrix Service Company with Dycom Industries, Inc. and MYR Group, Inc. as the overall composition of our business has changed and we believe this new peer group more closely resembles us from both an operations and market capitalization perspective. The returns are calculated assuming that an investment with a value of 100 was made in our common stock, the S P 500 and the Peer Group as of December 31, 2018. All dividends were reinvested in additional shares of common stock. The Peer Group investment is weighted based on the market capitalization of each company at the measurement period. The graph lines merely connect the measuring dates and do not reflect fluctuations between those dates. The stock performance shown on the graph is not intended to be indicative of future stock performance.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and unknown or changed circumstances. For a further discussion, please see Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those risks inherent with our business as discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors . The following discussion starts with an overview of our business and a discussion of trends, including seasonality, that affect our industry. That is followed by an overview of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Next we discuss our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources, including our off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations. We conclude with a discussion of our outlook and backlog. Introduction We are one of the leading providers of infrastructure services operating mainly in the United States and Canada. We provide a wide range of construction services, maintenance, replacement, fabrication and engineering services to a diversified base of customers. Through the end of 2022, we segregated our business into three reportable segments: the Utilities segment, the Energy/Renewables segment, and the Pipeline segment. In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our reportable segments in connection with the realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these new segments. The current reportable segments include the Utilities segment and the Energy segment, which is made up of our former Energy/Renewables and Pipeline Services segments. The Utilities segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services, including the installation and maintenance of new and existing natural gas and electric utility distribution and transmission systems, and communication systems. The Energy segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada and specializes in a range of services that include engineering, procurement, and construction, retrofits, highway and bridge construction, demolition, site work, soil stabilization, mass excavation, flood control, upgrades, repairs, outages, pipeline construction and maintenance, pipeline integrity services, and maintenance services for entities in the renewable energy and energy storage, renewable fuels, and petroleum and petrochemical industries, as well as state departments of transportation. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, major electrical and gas projects for a number of large utility companies in the United States, significant renewable energy projects for energy companies, as well as projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year, and the projects can vary in length from daily work orders to as long as 36 months, and occasionally longer, for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenue in any given year. We generate revenue under a range of contracting types, including fixed-price, unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts, each of which has a different risk profile. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, 3.9 billion, 2.7 billion, and 2.1 billion, respectively of our revenue is derived from contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value. For these contracts, revenue is recognized over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer (typically using an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress). For certain contracts, where scope is not adequately defined and we can t reasonably estimate total contract value, revenue is recognized either on an input basis, based on contract costs incurred as defined within the respective

 contracts, or an output basis based on units completed. Costs to obtain contracts are generally not significant and are expensed in the period incurred. The classification of revenue and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in multiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses were made. Acquisition of PLH On August 1, 2022, we acquired PLH Group, Inc. PLH in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately 429.0 million, net of cash acquired. PLH is a utility-focused infrastructure services company with concentrations in key fast-growing regions of the United States. The transaction directly aligns with our strategic focus on higher-growth, higher margin markets and expands our capabilities in the utility markets including power delivery, communications, and gas utilities. The total purchase price was funded through a combination of borrowings under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2022, which increased our term loan to an aggregate principal amount of 945.0 million (the New Term Loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, in which the lenders agreed to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to 325.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ). We incorporated the majority of the PLH operations into our Utilities segment with the remaining operations going to our Energy segment. Acquisition of B Comm Holdco, LLC On June 8, 2022, we acquired B Comm Holdco, LLC B Comm in an all-cash transaction of approximately 36.0 million, net of cash acquired. B Comm was incorporated into our Utilities segment and is a provider of maintenance, repair, upgrade and installation services to the communications markets. The transaction directly aligns with the strategy to grow our Master Services Agreement MSA revenue base and expand our communication services within the utility markets. The total purchase price was funded with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Acquisition of Alberta Screw Piles, Ltd. On March 1, 2022, we acquired Alberta Screw Piles, Ltd. ASP for a cash price of approximately 4.1 million. In addition, the sellers could receive a contingent earnout payment of up to 3.2 million based on achievement of certain operating targets over the one year periods ending March 1, 2023 and March 1, 2024, respectively. We incorporated the operations of ASP into our Energy segment. Acquisition of Future Infrastructure Holdings, LLC. On January 15, 2021, we acquired Future Infrastructure Holdings, LLC FIH for approximately 604.7 million, net of cash acquired. FIH was incorporated into our Utilities segment and is a provider of non-discretionary maintenance, repair, upgrade, and installation services to the communications, regulated gas utility, and infrastructure markets. FIH furthers our strategic plan to expand our service lines, enter new markets, and grow our MSA revenue base. The transaction directly aligns with our strategy to grow in large, higher growth, higher margin markets, and expands our utility services capabilities. The total purchase price was funded through a combination of existing cash balances, borrowings under our Term Loan facility, and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Business Environment We believe there are growth opportunities across the industries we serve and we continue to have a positive long-term outlook. Although not without risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Forward-Looking Statements and included in Item 1A. Risk Factors , we believe, with our full-service operations, broad geographic reach, financial position and technical expertise, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities and trends in our industries.

 We have seen and continue to anticipate potential changes to the already stringent regulatory and environmental requirements for many of our clients infrastructure projects, which may improve the timing and certainty of the projects. While permitting and other regulatory challenges create uncertainty as to the timing of some of our opportunities, we continue to see bidding activity for numerous midstream pipeline projects. We believe that we have the financial and operational strength to meet the challenge of either short-term delays or the impact of significant increases in work. We continue to be optimistic about both short and longer-term opportunities. Our current view of the outlook for our major end markets is as follows: Construction of alternative energy facilities, chemical processing facilities, renewable natural gas facilities, solar power facilities, wind farms, battery storage We believe state and federal governments, investors and utilities remain committed to a changing fuel generation mix that continues to move toward more alternative energy sources. As this trend grows, along with the demand for power, we are seeing an increase in new power generation facilities powered by renewable energy sources, as well as energy storage systems. We are benefitting from the increased spending and long-term tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act IRA signed by the President in August of 2022. The IRA extends tax incentives for wind and solar facilities and includes provisions to support standalone battery energy storage systems. The long term extension of these credits and strong support of U.S. manufacturing has attracted a significant amount of new capital to finance renewable projects as well as to enhance the supply chain needed to meet increasing demand. Other trends we are seeing are major investments in industrial gases and agricultural chemicals. To the extent this dynamic continues, we anticipate continued engineering, procurement, and construction opportunities, primarily benefitting our Energy segment. Communications construction opportunities We believe the federal government remains committed to improving or expanding broadband communications access. The IRA and other Federal and State programs provide critical funding to help construct and improve the infrastructure required to provide sufficient broadband access to areas that have historically had lower access to broadband services. We expect these opportunities, as well as ongoing spending by communications companies, to benefit our Utilities segment. Power Delivery We are experiencing strong tailwinds in our power delivery business as the industry continues to invest in grid resiliency, modernization, renewable generation integration, and the push for electrification. Our national position in this specific market allows for scalable coverage across the industry. Electric distribution undergrounding initiatives with clients in our key markets has been, and will continue to be, a strong opportunity for us as we see utilities customers continue to invest in grid reliability. Additionally, we are experiencing new opportunities as utilities providers invest in renewable energy and upgrade their transmission infrastructure. Inspection, maintenance and replacement of electric utility infrastructure We expect the demand for electricity in the United States to grow over the long-term and believe enhancements to the electric utility infrastructure are needed to efficiently serve the power needs of the future. Renewable generation will require substations and transmission lines to connect the new generation sources to customers. In addition, current federal legislation also requires the power industry to meet federal reliability standards for its transmission and distribution systems. We also expect to benefit from the spending authorized in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act intended to improve the electric grid. These opportunities, as well as ongoing electric utility repair and maintenance opportunities are expected to benefit our Utilities segment. Inspection, maintenance and replacement of gas utility infrastructure We expect that ongoing safety enhancements to gas pipeline systems and the gas utility infrastructure will provide continuing opportunities for our Utilities segment. We also expect that ongoing gas utility repair and maintenance opportunities will continue.

 Construction of natural gas-fired power plants and industrial plants We expect continued construction opportunities for both base-load and peak shaving power plants; however, we are aware that environmental concerns over gas fired power plants may impact the timing and location of near-term construction opportunities in certain states. We believe that based on continuing population growth, the intermittency of renewable power resources, and the environmental requirements limiting using ocean water for cooling, gas power plants will be needed in spite of vocal opposition to these non-green generation sources. In addition, the generally historically low price of natural gas could result in the continued replacement of coal-fired power plants and the conversion and expansion at chemical plants and industrial facilities in other parts of the United States. These opportunities would benefit our Energy segment. Construction of petroleum, natural gas, natural gas liquid, and other liquid pipelines We expect that the volatility in the price of oil could reduce activities in most, if not all of the shale basins. In addition, the ability of our customers to obtain permits for projects could impact the demand for our services, especially for larger interstate pipelines. However, production from the shale formations and increased demand for exporting liquified natural gas LNG could strain the current capacity limitations between production and processing locations which would provide opportunities for our Energy segment. Inspection, maintenance and replacement of pipeline infrastructure We believe that regulatory measures around the frequency or stringency of pipeline integrity testing requirements provides growth opportunity in our Energy segment. Regulatory requirements continue to mandate or require our customers to test, inspect, repair, maintain and replace pipeline infrastructure to ensure that it operates safely, reliably and in an environmentally conscious manner. In addition, permitting challenges associated with construction of new pipelines can make existing pipeline infrastructure more valuable, motivating owners to extend the useful life of existing pipeline assets through maintenance and integrity initiatives. As a result, we expect demand to continue to grow for our pipeline integrity services. Material Trends and Uncertainties We generate our revenue from construction and engineering projects, as well as from providing a variety of infrastructure services. We depend in part on spending by companies in the communications, gas and electric utilities, energy, chemical, and pipeline industries, as well as state departments of transportation. Over the past several years, each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities, more reliable gas and electric utility infrastructure, upgraded and expanded local highway and bridge needs, and from the activity level in the pipeline industry. However, periodically, each of these industries and government agencies is adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions. Economic and other factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period. We actively monitor the impact of the dynamic macroeconomic environment, including the impact of inflation and the instability in the banking sector, on all aspects of our business. We have experienced increased fuel and labor costs and anticipate that elevated levels of cost inflation could persist in 2024. In an effort to mitigate the impacts of inflation on our operations, we attempt to recover increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions that allow us to adjust billing rates for certain major contracts annually; by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work; or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors. However, the annual adjustment provided by certain contracts is typically subject to a cap and there can be an extended period of time between the impact of inflation on our costs and when billing rates are adjusted. In some cases, our actual cost increases have exceeded the contractual caps, and therefore negatively impacted our operations. We have been successful in renegotiating some of our major contracts to address the increased costs on future work and will continue to address this with our customers going forward. Fluctuations in the market prices of oil, gas and other fuel sources have affected demand for our services. Volatility in the prices of oil, gas, and liquid natural gas that has occurred in the past few years could create uncertainty with respect to demand for our pipeline services, both in the near term and for future projects. While the construction of gathering lines within the oil shale formations may remain at lower levels for an extended period, we believe that over 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 time, the need for pipeline infrastructure for mid-stream and gas utility companies will result in a continuing need for our services. The continuing changes in the regulatory environment have affected the demand for our services, either by increasing our work, delaying projects, or cancelling projects. For example, environmental laws and regulations have provided challenges to pipeline projects, resulting in delays or cancellations that impact the timing of revenue recognition. However, environmental laws and new pipeline regulations could increase the demand for our pipeline maintenance and integrity services. In addition, the regulatory environment in certain states has resulted in delays for the construction of gas-fired power plants. However, the increased demand for renewable resources is also creating demand for our infrastructure services, such as the need for battery storage and the construction of utility scale solar facilities. We are exposed to certain market risks related to changes in interest rates. To monitor and manage these market risks, we have established risk management policies and procedures. Our Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate which exposes us to interest rate risk. From time to time, we may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, 300.0 million of our variable rate debt outstanding was economically hedged. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, a 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately 5.7 million. Seasonality, Cyclicality and Variability Our results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, and named storms, which can impact our ability to perform infrastructure services. These seasonal impacts can affect revenue and profitability in all of our businesses. Any quarter can be affected either negatively, or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects in our Utilities segment tends to be lower during the early part of the calendar year due to clients internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter. Our project values range in size from several hundred dollars to several hundred million dollars. The bulk of our work is comprised of project sizes that average less than 3.0 million. We also perform construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on customer timing, project duration, weather, and general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines, or delays in new projects, or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of our financial condition, or operating results for any other quarter, or for an entire year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates General The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and also affect the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for each period. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available, is dependent on future events, or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. Often, estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates may be used in our accounting for revenue recognized over time, the allowance for doubtful accounts, useful lives of property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes. Actual results could materially differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if i) it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, ii) different estimates could have reasonably been used, or iii) changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 
 The following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. We periodically review these accounting policies and critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Revenue recognition We generate revenue under a range of contracting types, including fixed-price, unit-price, time and material, and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts, each of which has a different risk profile. A portion of our revenue is derived from contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value. For these contracts, revenue is recognized over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer (typically using an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress). For certain contracts, where scope is not adequately defined and we can t reasonably estimate total contract value, revenue is recognized either on an input basis, based on contract costs incurred as defined within the respective contracts, or an output basis based on units completed. Costs to obtain contracts are generally not significant and are expensed in the period incurred. We evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single performance obligation and whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. ASC 606 defines a performance obligation as a contractual promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate a contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, is not distinct. However, occasionally we have contracts with multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the observable standalone selling price, if available, or alternatively our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach for each performance obligation. Accounting for long-term contracts involves the use of various techniques to estimate total transaction price and costs. For long-term contracts, transaction price, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenue earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenue and income, can be impacted by changes in productivity, scheduling, the unit cost of labor, subcontracts, materials and equipment. Additionally, external factors such as weather, client needs, client delays in providing permits and approvals, labor availability, governmental regulation, politics and any prevailing impacts from pandemics or epidemics may affect the progress of a project s completion, and thus the timing of revenue recognition. To the extent that original cost estimates are modified, estimated costs to complete increase, delivery schedules are delayed, or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded, cash flow, revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected. The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including contract modifications (change orders and claims), liquidated damages, volume discounts, performance bonuses, incentive fees, and other terms that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent we believe we have an enforceable right, and it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Our estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us at this time. Contract modifications result from changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract modifications for which customers have not agreed to both scope and price. We consider claims to be contract modifications for which we seek, or will seek, to collect from customers, or others, for customer-caused changes in contract specifications or design, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers. Claims can also be caused by non-customer-caused changes, such as rain or other weather delays. Costs associated with contract modifications are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred. In most instances, contract modifications are for 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 goods or services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price, and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis. In some cases, settlement of contract modifications may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estimates regularly. We recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts under the cumulative catch-up method. Under this method, the cumulative impact of the profit adjustment is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full, including any previously recognized profit, in the period it is identified and recognized as an accrued loss provision which is included in Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contract revenue recognized over time, the accrued loss provision is adjusted so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 203.5 million of unapproved contract modifications included in the aggregate transaction prices. These unapproved contract modifications were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. Approximately 175.7 million of the unapproved contract modifications had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis through December 31, 2023. In all forms of contracts, we estimate the collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as the transaction price, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client s expected budget amount, the client frequently requests an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon agreed-upon contractual terms, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Sometimes, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled revenue, which is a contract asset. However, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue, which is a contract liability. The caption Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the following: unbilled revenue, which arise when revenue has been recorded, but the amount will not be billed until a later date; retainage amounts for the portion of the contract price earned by us for work performed, but held for payment by the customer as a form of security until we reach certain construction milestones; and contract materials for certain job specific materials not yet installed, which are valued using the specific identification method relating the cost incurred to a specific project. The caption Contract liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the following: deferred revenue on billings in excess of contract revenue recognized to date, and the accrued loss provision. Business combinations We use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses we acquire. The determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets. 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 Identifiable Tangible Assets. Significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable, contract assets, leases and fixed assets (generally consisting of facilities and construction equipment). We determine the fair value of these assets as of the acquisition date. For current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition, we will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature. We estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach, based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age. Identifiable Intangible Assets. When necessary, we use the assistance of an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. Third-party specialists are used to help us identify and separate intangible assets apart from goodwill such as customer relationships and tradenames. Fair value is determined by analyzing revenue trends, expected growth rates for existing customers, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and intended use of future assets. A liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at its fair value at the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss. Fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date based on management s best estimate of estimated earnout payments. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States provide a measurement period of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business. Most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period. During the measurement period, adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded. After the measurement date, any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur. In performing these assessments, management relies on various factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses, there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated. We account for goodwill, including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill as of October 1 of each year, unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test. Under ASC 350, we can assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of intangible assets is necessary. Our qualitative assessment is used to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. Factors used in our qualitative assessment include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and Company and reporting unit specific events. If deemed necessary, we use the quantitative impairment test outlined in ASC 350, which compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our financial plan discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows. Other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill of the reporting unit. There were no impairments of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Income taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 effect of changes in tax rates on net deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized as an increase or decrease in net income in the period the tax change is enacted. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and the length of tax asset carryforward periods. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions. If we subsequently determine that some or all deferred tax assets that were previously offset by a valuation allowance are realizable, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased by reducing the valuation allowance, thereby increasing income in the period when that determination is made. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2023, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 1.8 million. Litigation and contingencies Litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency. We record costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss, or range of possible loss, we review and evaluate litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for a potential litigation loss. Management is unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of other claims and legal proceedings; however, after review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles/self-insurance retention, management believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims and believes that the reasonably possible outcome of such claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Table of Contents 
 2022 and 2021 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 923.0 million, or 26.4 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to growth in our Energy and Utilities segments, and the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm 406.2 million combined) as described in the segment results below. Gross Profit 2023 and 2022 For the year ended December 31, 2023, gross profit increased by 130.6 million, or 28.6 , compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained consistent at 10.3 compared to the same period in 2022. 2022 and 2021 For the year ended December 31, 2022, gross profit increased by 40.2 million, or 9.7 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue and the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm 46.4 million combined), partially offset by a decrease in margins. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10.3 from 11.9 in the same period in 2021 primarily as a result of negative gross margins experienced on pipeline projects in 2022, increased labor and fuel costs in our Utilities segment, and the favorable impact from the closeout of multiple pipeline projects in 2021, as more fully described in the segment results below. In addition, we had a favorable impact from the change in useful lives of certain equipment, which reduced our depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 by 19.3 million compared to the same period in 2021. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A consist primarily of compensation and benefits to executive, management level and administrative employees, marketing and communications, professional fees, rent for facilities and utilities. 2023 and 2022 SG A expenses were 328.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 47.2 million, or 16.7 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs associated with improved operational performance and increases in headcount from the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm. SG A expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased to 5.8 compared to 6.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased revenue. 2022 and 2021 SG A expenses were 281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 51.5 million, or 22.4 compared to 2021, primarily due to the increases in headcount from the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm 28.3 million) and increased costs to support our strong organic growth. SG A expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 6.4 compared to 6.6 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased revenue.

 Transaction and related costs 2023 and 2022 Transaction and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 were 5.7 million, a decrease of 14.4 million or 71.7 compared to 2022. The decrease was due to professional fees paid to advisors for the acquisitions of B Comm and PLH in 2022. 2022 and 2021 Transaction and related costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 20.1 million, an increase of 3.7 million or 22.3 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in professional fees paid to advisors for the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm. Gain on Sale and Leaseback Transaction On June 22, 2022, we completed a sale and leaseback transaction of land and buildings located in Carson, California for an aggregate sales price, net of closing costs, of 49.9 million. Under the transaction, the land, buildings and improvements were sold and leased back for an initial term of three years. The property qualified for sale and leaseback treatment and is classified as an operating lease. Therefore, we recorded a gain on the transaction of 40.1 million. The gain is included in Gain on sale and leaseback transaction on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no such comparable transactions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021. Other income and expense Non-operating income and expense items for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):

The increase of 39.0 million was due primarily to higher average debt balances from the borrowings related to the PLH acquisition and higher average interest rates. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 39.2 million compared to 18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase of 20.7 million was due primarily to higher average debt balances from the borrowings related to the PLH acquisition and a higher average interest rate. The weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 6.8 , 6.2 and 2.8 , respectively.

 Provision for income taxes Our provision for income taxes increased 25.3 million to 51.5 million for 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the tax benefit recognized in 2022 for capital losses, the 2023 expiration of a temporary law which allowed full deductibility of per diem expenses in 2021 and 2022, and increased pre-tax profits subject to tax. The 2023 effective tax rate was 29 . Our provision for income taxes decreased 9.8 million to 26.3 million for 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by the release of valuation allowances during the second and third quarters of 2022 , partially offset by tax on increased pre-tax profits. Due to capital gains on the sale of California properties in 2022, we have released all of the valuation allowance previously placed on capital losses and recognized a 5.8 decrease in our 2022 annual effective tax rate. The 2022 effective tax rate was 16.5 .

 Segment Results Utilities Segment Revenue and gross profit for the Utilities segment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 

Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 of of of Segment Segment Segment (Millions) Revenue (Millions) Revenue (Millions) Revenue Utilities Segment Revenue 2,380.2 2,024.3 1,658.0 Gross profit 207.0 8.7 210.7 10.4 186.3 11.2 2023 and 2022 Revenue increased by 355.9 million, or 17.6 , during 2023 compared to 2022. The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm in 2022 and increased activity in our power delivery and communications markets. Gross profit decreased 3.7 million, or 1.8 , during 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in margins, partially offset by growth in revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 8.7 in 2023 compared to 10.4 in 2022 primarily due to productivity issues on some legacy PLH projects that are nearing completion, higher costs associated with a communication project in 2023, and a shift in revenue mix in 2023. 2022 and 2021 Revenue increased by 366.3 million, or 22.1 , during 2022 compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm 260.7 million combined) in 2022 and increased activity across the power delivery and communications markets. Gross profit increased 24.4 million, or 13.1 , during 2022 compared to 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the incremental impact of the PLH and B Comm acquisitions 26.2 million), partially offset by lower margins. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10.4 in 2022 compared to 11.2 in 2021 primarily due to increased fuel and labor costs from the inflationary environment we experienced in 2022. A substantial majority of the work done in our Utilities segment is performed over longer term MSA contracts. These MSA contracts generally have escalation provisions that allow us to adjust billing rates annually, but typically the annual adjustment is subject to a cap and there can be an extended period of time between the impact of inflation on our costs and when billing rates are adjusted. Due to the inflationary environment we experienced in 2022, our actual cost increases exceeded the contractual caps, and therefore negatively impacted gross margins. We were successful in renegotiating some of our major contracts to address the increased fuel and labor costs on future work and continue to address this with our utility customers.

Gross profit increased by 134.3 million, or 54.5 during 2023 compared to 2022, due to higher revenue and margins. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 11.4 in 2023 compared to 10.3 in 2022, primarily due to significant growth in higher margin renewable energy work, strong performance on a pipeline project in the mid-Atlantic in 2023, higher costs on a separate pipeline project in the mid-Atlantic from unfavorable weather conditions experienced in 2022 and higher relative carrying costs for equipment and personnel in 2022 caused by lower than anticipated pipeline volumes. 2022 and 2021 Revenue increased by 556.6 million, or 30.3 , during 2022 compared to 2021, due to increased renewable energy activity 430.1 million), the PLH acquisition 145.4 million), and increased activity on electric power plants and hydrogen plants, partially offset by the substantial completion of pipeline projects in 2021 and a decline in midstream pipeline market demand. Gross profit increased by 15.8 million, or 6.8 , during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to 10.3 in 2022 compared to 12.5 in 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact from the closeout of multiple pipeline projects in 2021, higher costs on a project in the Mid-Atlantic from unfavorable weather conditions experienced in 2022 and lower than anticipated volumes in 2022, which lead to higher relative carrying costs for equipment and personnel. The decrease was partially offset by increased revenue on higher margin renewable energy projects in 2022 and higher costs associated with an LNG plant project in the Northeast in 2021.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Needs Liquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund business operations, meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our cash flows from operating activities. If needed, we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs. Our short-term and long-term cash requirements consist primarily of working capital, investments to support revenue growth and maintain our equipment and facilities, general corporate needs, and to service our debt obligations. At December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, commercial letters of credit outstanding were 51.6 million, and available borrowing capacity was 273.4 million. In June 2023, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Facility (the Facility with PNC Bank, National Association PNC to reduce interest costs and improve cash flows from trade accounts receivable. The Facility has a one-year term, and the maximum purchase commitment by PNC is 100.0 million, at any one time. Under the Facility, certain of our designated subsidiaries may sell their trade accounts receivable as they are originated to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote Special Purpose Entity created specifically for this purpose. The total outstanding balance of trade accounts receivable that have been sold and derecognized is 75.0 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had 25.0 million in available capacity under the Facility. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis. We may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock, convertible notes, term debt or increasing our credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 217.8 million at December 31, 2023, compared to 248.7 million at December 31, 2022. We anticipate that our cash and investments on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our operating needs, our planned capital expenditures, and settle our commitments and contingencies for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. The construction industry is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to make capital expenditures to meet anticipated needs for our services. In 2023, we spent approximately 103.0 million for capital expenditures, which included 34.0 million for construction equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to total between 80.0 million and 100.0 million for 2024, which includes 20.0 million to 40.0 million for construction equipment. Cash Flows Cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are summarized as follows (in millions): 

Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Change in cash: Net cash provided by operating activities 198.6 83.3 79.7 Net cash used in investing activities (30.0) (481.9) (691.3) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (205.3) 452.0 485.8 Effect of exchange rate changes 1.3 (0.1) 0.5 Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (35.4) 53.3 (125.3)

The change year-over-year was primarily due to improvement in the impact from the changes in assets and liabilities and the inclusion of 40.1 million of gain on a sale and leaseback transaction in 2022 net income. The significant components of the 0.1 million change in assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows: Contract assets increased by 229.8 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to significant revenue growth in 2023; Accounts receivable increased 16.9 million from December 31, 2022, which is net of the 75.0 million we received from the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility; Accounts payable increased 93.4 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of payments to our vendors; Contract liabilities increased 84.7 million, primarily due to higher deferred revenue; and Other current assets decreased by 45.6 million primarily due to an income tax refund and the timing of prepaid material purchases. 2022 and 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2022 was 83.3 million, an increase of 3.6 million compared to 2021. The change year-over-year was primarily due to improvement in the impact from the changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net income (after adjusting for cash from gains reported in investing activities). The significant components of the 79.0 million change in assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 are summarized as follows: Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased 197.2 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to revenue growth and the timing of our payments to vendors;

 Contract assets increased by 118.8 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to significant revenue growth in 2022; Accounts receivable increased by 98.7 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased revenue; and Other current assets increased by 70.3 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to prepaid material purchases related to solar projects. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was 30.0 million, 481.9 million, and 691.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2023, we received 9.3 million from a net working capital true-up related to the PLH acquisition. During 2022, we used 478.4 million for acquisitions, primarily for the acquisitions of PLH and B Comm. During 2021, we used 607.0 million for the acquisition of FIH. We purchased property and equipment for 103.0 million, 94.7 million and 133.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, principally for our construction activities and facilities investment. We believe the ownership or long-term leasing of equipment is generally preferable to renting equipment on a project-by-project basis, as this strategy helps to ensure the equipment is available for our projects when needed. In addition, this approach has historically resulted in lower overall equipment costs. We periodically sell assets, typically to update our fleet. We received proceeds from the sale of assets of 63.7 million, 41.3 million and 49.5 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, we received net proceeds of 49.9 million from a sale and leaseback transaction of land and buildings during the year ended December 31, 2022. Financing activities Financing activities used cash of 205.3 million in 2023, which was primarily due to the following: Net payments on our revolving credit facilities of 100.0 million; and Payment of long-term debt of 97.0 million. Financing activities provided cash of 452.0 million in 2022, which was primarily due to the following: Proceeds from the entry into an amended and upsized term loan of 432.9 million, net of debt issuance costs paid; Net borrowings on our credit facilities of 100.0 million; Proceeds from the issuance of debt secured by our equipment of 30.0 million; Payment of long-term debt of 86.8 million; and Dividend payments to our stockholders of 12.8 million. Financing activities provided cash of 485.8 million in 2021, which was primarily due to the following: Proceeds from the entry into an amended and upsized term loan of 395.1 million, net of debt issuance costs paid; Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 178.7 million; Proceeds from the issuance of debt secured by our equipment of 61.7 million;

 Payment of long-term debt of 113.9 million; Purchase of common stock of 14.7 million; and Dividend payments to our stockholders of 12.6 million. Debt Activities Credit Agreement On August 1, 2022, we entered into the Amended Credit Agreement with CIBC Bank USA, as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent and co-lead arranger, and the financial parties thereto (collectively, the Lenders that increased the Term Loan by 439.5 million to an aggregate principal amount of 945.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on August 1, 2027. In addition to the New Term Loan, the Amended Credit Agreement increased the existing 200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, whereby the Lenders agreed to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit, to 325.0 million. At December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, commercial letters of credit outstanding were 51.6 million, and available borrowing capacity was 273.4 million. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, we must make quarterly principal payments on the New Term Loan in an amount equal to approximately 11.8 million, with the balance due on August 1, 2027. The proceeds from the New Term Loan and additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were used to finance the acquisition of PLH. We capitalized 6.5 million of debt issuance costs during the third quarter of 2022 associated with the Amended Credit Agreement that is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of 2022 of 0.8 million related to the Amended Credit Agreement. The principal amount of all loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus an applicable margin as specified in the Amended Credit Agreement (based on our net senior debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ratio as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (ii) the Base Rate (which is the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 or (b) the prime rate as announced by the Administrative Agent) plus an applicable margin as specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. Quarterly non-use fees, letter of credit fees and administrative agent fees are payable at rates specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. The principal amount of any loan drawn under the Amended Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, with a minimum prepayment of 5.0 million. Loans made under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by our assets, including, among others, our cash, inventory, equipment (excluding equipment subject to permitted liens), and accounts receivable. Certain subsidiaries have issued joint and several guaranties in favor of the Lenders for all amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various restrictive and financial covenants including, among others, a net senior debt/EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA to cash interest ratio. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event we dispose of more than 20 of our total assets. We were in compliance with the covenants for the Amended Credit Agreement at December 31, 2023. On January 31, 2023, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to the fluctuations in variable interest rates. The swap effectively exchanged the interest rate on 300.0 million of the debt outstanding under our New Term Loan from variable to a fixed rate of 4.095 per annum, plus an applicable margin which was 2.25 at December 31, 2023. The interest rate swap matures on January 31, 2025.

 Canadian Credit Facilities We have credit facilities totaling 14.0 million in Canadian dollars for the purposes of issuing commercial letters of credit and providing funding for working capital. At December 31, 2023, commercial letters of credit outstanding were 0.9 million in Canadian dollars and there were no outstanding borrowings. Available capacity at December 31, 2023 was 13.1 million in Canadian dollars. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2023, we had 964.7 million of outstanding long-term debt, and there were no short-term borrowings. A summary of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 is as follows (in millions): 

Total 1 Year 2 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years After 5 Years Long-term debt 964.7 72.9 141.4 743.3 7.1 Interest on long-term debt (1) 225.4 64.0 122.3 38.6 0.5 Operating leases 406.6 112.8 171.5 97.8 24.5 1,596.7 249.7 435.1 879.8 32.1 Letters of credit 52.3 52.3 

 (1) The interest amount represents interest payments for our fixed rate debt assuming that principal payments are made as originally scheduled. Our Credit Agreement bears interest at variable market rates, and estimated payments are based on the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2023, including the impact of our interest rate swap. The summary does not include potential obligations under multi-employer pension plans in which some of our employees participate. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates are generally specified in our collective bargaining agreements, and contributions are made to the plans based on employee payrolls. Our obligations for future periods cannot be determined because we cannot predict the number of employees that we will employ at any given time nor the plans in which they may participate. We may also be required to make additional contributions to multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these contributions will be determined based on our union payroll. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers. The amounts of additional funds that we may be obligated to contribute cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected on our balance sheet. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangement with VIEs. The following represents transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered material off-balance sheet arrangements. At December 31, 2023, we had letters of credit outstanding of 52.3 million under the terms of our credit agreements. These letters of credit are primarily used by our insurance carriers to ensure reimbursement for amounts that they are disbursing on our behalf, such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance program. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post a letter of credit to ensure payments to our subcontractors or guarantee performance under our contracts. Letters of credit reduce our borrowing availability under our Amended Credit Agreement and Canadian Credit Facility. If a beneficiary were to successfully draw on any letter of credit, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit, and we may be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit.

 In the ordinary course of our business, we may be required by our customers to post surety bid or completion bonds in connection with services that we provide. At December 31, 2023, we had bid and completion bonds issued and outstanding totaling approximately 5.9 billion. The remaining performance obligation on those bonded projects totaled approximately 2.7 billion at December 31, 2023. We do not believe that it is likely that a material claim will be made under our surety arrangements. Certain of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions. In most instances, these agreements require that we contribute to multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans. For many plans, the contributions are determined annually and required future contributions cannot be determined since contribution rates depend on the total number of union employees and actuarial calculations based on the demographics of all participants. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ), as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Amendments Act of 1980, subjects employers to potential liabilities in the event of an employer s complete or partial withdrawal of an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added new funding rules that are classified as endangered , seriously endangered , or critical status. Withdrawal liabilities or requirements for increased future contributions could negatively impact our results of operations and liquidity. We enter into employment agreements with certain employees which provide for compensation and benefits under certain circumstances and which may contain a change of control clause. We may be obligated to make payments under the terms of these agreements. From time to time we make other guarantees, such as guaranteeing the obligations of our subsidiaries. Backlog For infrastructure services contractors, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue streams. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We define backlog as anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value Fixed Backlog ), and the estimated revenue on MSA work MSA Backlog ). We present two measures of backlog; one that includes Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog for the next twelve months, and total backlog that includes all Fixed Backlog and MSA Backlog to the end of the MSA agreement. We do not consider renewals when estimating MSA Backlog. We do not include certain contracts in the calculation of fixed backlog where scope, and therefore contract value, is not adequately defined. We estimate MSA Backlog based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts and estimates of customer demand based on information from our customers.

The backlog estimates include amounts from estimated MSAs, but our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase an amount of services from us under the MSAs. Any of our contracts may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we are typically reimbursed for all of our costs through a specific date, as well as all reasonable costs associated with demobilizing from the jobsite, but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in backlog. Projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements or project specific issues. Future revenue from projects where scope, and therefore contract value, is not adequately defined may not be included in our estimated backlog amount. Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices Our operations are affected by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions that allow us to adjust billing rates for certain major contracts annually; by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work; or by entering into back-to-back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors. However, the annual adjustment provided by certain contracts is typically subject to a cap and there can be an extended period of time between the impact of inflation on our costs and when billing rates are adjusted. In some cases, our actual cost increases have exceeded the contractual caps, and therefore negatively impacted our operations. We have been able to renegotiate some of our major contracts to address the increased costs on future work and will continue to address this with our customers going forward. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to risks related to market conditions. These risks primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We may seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments. These instruments have in the past included interest rate swaps and may in the future include foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and hedges against commodity price fluctuations. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short term investments, short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value at December 31, 2023, due to the generally short maturities of these items.

Table of Contents 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate which exposes us to interest rate risk. From time to time, we may use certain derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, 300.0 million of our variable rate debt outstanding was economically hedged. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, a 1.0 increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately 5.7 million. We do not execute transactions or use financial derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives. In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2023, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2023, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Management based this assessment on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Primoris Services Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Primoris Services Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
 F-2 

Table of Contents 
 recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition Estimated contract costs and variable consideration estimates: As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company s consolidated revenue was 5,715 million, of which, 3,900 million was derived from contracts where scope was adequately defined, and was recognized over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Under this method, the costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion are used to calculate revenue. Total estimated costs at completion, and thus revenue and margin, are impacted by many factors, which can cause significant changes in estimates during the life cycle of a project. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the amount of revenue and profit recognized. Additionally, the nature of the Company s contracts give rise to several types of variable consideration. The Company s estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on their assessment of anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. Based on the significant judgment required by management and high degree of subjectivity involved in the determination of both total estimated costs at completion and variable consideration, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence, we have identified auditing these estimates as a critical audit matter. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the contract management cycle, including those related to the accumulation of the estimated costs to complete a contract and the estimation of variable consideration. Tested a selection of contracts where scope was adequately defined, including evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions and judgments underlying the accounting for these selected contracts as follows: o Inquired with and inspected questionnaires prepared by project personnel to understand the status of the contract, changes from prior periods, key assumptions underlying the revenue and costs, and the existence of any claims or litigation and corroborating such information. o Assessed the reasonableness of estimated costs to complete by analyzing historical contract performance relative to overall contractual commitments and estimated gross margin at year end. We assessed management s assumptions on future contract costs by comparing them with executed change 
 F-3 

Table of Contents 
 orders, estimate documentation, correspondence with the customer, and job cost details with supporting third-party evidence. o Tested management s estimation process by performing lookback analyses at the contract level to evaluate estimated costs and variable consideration settled in the current year compared to management s prior year estimates. o Evaluated the appropriateness of the Company s inclusion or exclusion of variable consideration from the work-in-process schedule in the selection of contracts.

 segments. We have longstanding customer relationships with utility, refining, petrochemical, power, midstream, and engineering companies, and state departments of transportation. We provide our services to a diversified base of customers, under a range of contracting options. A portion of our services are provided under Master Service Agreements MSA ), which are generally multi-year agreements. The remainder of our services are generated from contracts for specific construction or installation projects. We are incorporated in the State of Delaware, and our corporate headquarters are located at 2300 N. Field Street, Suite 1900, Dallas, Texas 75201. Unless specifically noted otherwise, as used throughout these consolidated financial statements, Primoris , the Company , we , our , us or its refers to the business, operations and financial results of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Reportable Segments Through the end of 2022, we segregated our business into reportable segments: the Utilities segment, the Energy/Renewables segment, and the Pipeline Services Pipeline segment. In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our reportable segments in connection with the realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these new segments. The current reportable segments include the Utilities segment and the Energy segment, which is made up of our former Energy/Renewables and Pipeline segments. See Note 13 Reportable Segments for a brief description of the reportable segments and their operations. The classification of revenue and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in multiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses, were made. Seasonality Our results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, and named storms, which can impact our ability to perform infrastructure services. These seasonal impacts can affect revenue and profitability in all of our businesses. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country. In addition, demand for new projects in our Utilities segment tends to be lower during the early part of the calendar year due to clients internal budget cycles. As a result, we usually experience higher revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first quarter. Variability Our project values range in size from several hundred dollars to several hundred million dollars. The bulk of our work is comprised of project sizes that average less than million. We also perform large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal but can fluctuate from year to year based on customer timing, project duration, weather, and general economic conditions. Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules. Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. Results from one quarter may not be indicative of financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.

Under the Facility, certain of our designated subsidiaries may sell their trade accounts receivable as they are originated to a wholly owned bankruptcy remote Special Purpose Entity SPE created specifically for this purpose. We control and, therefore, consolidate the SPE in our consolidated financial statements. The SPE transfers ownership and control of qualifying accounts receivable to PNC up to the maximum purchase commitment. We and our related subsidiaries have no continuing involvement in the transferred accounts receivable, other than collection and administrative responsibilities, and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy our creditors or our related subsidiaries.

 Interest rate swap Liabilities as of December 31, 2023: Contingent consideration Assets as of December 31, 2022: Cash and cash equivalents Interest rate swap Liabilities as of December 31, 2022: Contingent consideration Other financial instruments not listed in the table consist of accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. These financial instruments generally approximate fair value based on their short-term nature. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates fair value based on a comparison with current prevailing market rates for loans of similar risks and maturities. The interest rate swap is measured at fair value using the income approach, which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value. These valuations primarily utilize indirectly observable inputs, including contractual terms, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments for additional information. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated fair value of the contractual obligation to pay the contingent consideration and any changes in estimated fair value are recorded as non-operating income or expense in our Statement of Income. Fair value is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimate of the probability of the acquired company meeting the contractual operating performance target discounted using our weighted average cost of capital. Significant changes in either management s estimate of the probability of meeting the performance target or our estimated discount rate would result in a different fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumption of the probability of meeting the performance target is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability, whereas a change in assumption of the estimated discount rate is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability. Upon meeting the target, we reflect the full liability on the balance sheet and record an adjustment to Other income (expense), net for the change in the fair value of the liability from the prior period.

The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date was million. Under ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ), we are required to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and remeasure to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. As a result of that remeasurement, we reduced the fair value of the contingent consideration in 2023 related to the ASP performance target contemplated in their purchase agreement and decreased the liability by million with a corresponding increase in non-operating income. million, net of cash acquired (the PLH acquisition ). PLH is a utility-focused specialty construction company with concentrations in growing regions of the United States. The transaction directly aligns with our strategic focus on higher-growth, higher margin markets and expands our capabilities in the power delivery, communications, and gas utilities markets. The total purchase price was funded through a combination of borrowings under our term loan facility and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During the second quarter of 2023, we finalized the estimate of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of PLH. The table below represents the purchase consideration and the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from PLH as of the acquisition date. Significant changes since our initial estimates reported in the third quarter of 2022 primarily relate to million of project adjustments increasing the fair value of contract liabilities acquired, a million change in deferred taxes, a million reduction in the fair value of acquired intangibles, a million decrease in the purchase consideration for a working capital true-up, and a million reduction in the fair value of fixed assets acquired. As a result of this and other adjustments to the initial estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, goodwill increased by approximately million since the third quarter of 2022. Adjustments recorded to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date.

 Income before provision for income taxes Net income Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic Diluted Earnings per share: Basic Diluted billion, billion, and billion, respectively of our revenue is derived from contracts where scope is adequately defined, and therefore we can reasonably estimate total contract value. For these contracts, revenue is recognized over time as work is completed because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer (typically using an input measure such as costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress). For certain contracts, where scope is not adequately defined and we can t reasonably estimate total contract value, revenue is recognized either on an input basis, based on contract costs incurred as defined within the respective contracts, or an output basis, based on units completed. Costs to obtain contracts are generally not significant and are expensed in the period incurred. We evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one single performance obligation and whether a single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. ASC 606 defines a performance obligation as a contractual promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our evaluation requires significant judgment and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate a contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, is not distinct. However, occasionally we have contracts with multiple performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the observable standalone selling price, if available, or alternatively our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach for each performance obligation. As of December 31, 2023, we had billion of remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the next 12 months and substantially all of the remaining balance in the to thereafter. Accounting for long-term contracts involves the use of various techniques to estimate total transaction price and costs. For long-term contracts, transaction price, estimated cost at completion and total costs incurred to date are used to calculate revenue earned. Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract. Total estimated costs, and thus contract revenue and income, can be impacted by

 million and million, respectively. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full, including the reversal of any previously recognized profit, in the period it is identified and recognized as an accrued loss provision which is included in Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contract revenue recognized over time, the accrued loss provision is adjusted so that the gross profit for the contract remains zero in future periods. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately million of unapproved contract modifications included in the aggregate transaction prices. These contract modifications were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. Approximately million of the unapproved contract modifications had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis through December 31, 2023. In all forms of contracts, we estimate the collectability of contract amounts at the same time that we estimate project costs. If we anticipate that there may be issues associated with the collectability of the full amount calculated as the transaction price, we may reduce the amount recognized as revenue to reflect the uncertainty associated with realization of the eventual cash collection. For example, when a cost reimbursable project exceeds the client s expected budget amount, the client frequently requests an adjustment to the final amount. Similarly, some utility clients reserve the right to audit costs for significant periods after performance of the work. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon agreed-upon contractual terms, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Sometimes, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in unbilled revenue, which is a contract asset. Also, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue, which is a contract liability.

Unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular fixed-price contract. However, these types of contracts offer additional profits when we complete the work for less cost than originally estimated. Unit-price and cost reimbursable contracts generally subject us to lower risk. Accordingly, the associated fees are usually lower than fees earned on fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, our profit may vary if actual costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates.

The Credit Agreement consisted of a million term loan (the Term Loan and a million revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility ), whereby the Lenders agreed to make loans on a revolving basis from time to time and to issue letters of credit for up to the million committed amount. The Credit Agreement contained an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the Term Loan or the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to million. On January 15, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, amending and restating our Credit Agreement to increase the Term Loan by million to an aggregate principal amount of million and to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement from July 9, 2023 to January 15, 2026. The proceeds from the additional borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were used to finance the acquisition of FIH. On August 1, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amended Credit Agreement with Administrative Agent and the Lenders that increased the Term Loan by million to an aggregate principal amount of million (as amended, the New Term Loan ). The Amended Credit Agreement is scheduled to mature on August 1, 2027.

In addition, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt during 2022 of million related to the Amended Credit Agreement. The principal amount of all loans under the Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus an applicable margin as specified in the Amended Credit Agreement (based on our net senior debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ratio as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (ii) the Base Rate (which is the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus or (b) the prime rate as announced by the Administrative Agent) plus an applicable margin as specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. Quarterly non-use fees, letter of credit fees and administrative agent fees are payable at rates specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. The principal amount of any loan drawn under the Amended Credit Agreement may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, with a minimum prepayment of million. Loans made under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by our assets, including, among others, our cash, inventory, equipment (excluding equipment subject to permitted liens), and accounts receivable. Certain subsidiaries have issued joint and several guaranties in favor of the Lenders for all amounts under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various restrictive and financial covenants including, among others, a net senior debt/EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA to cash interest ratio. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes restrictions on investments, change of control provisions and provisions in the event we dispose of more than of our total assets. We were in compliance with the covenants for the Amended Credit Agreement at December 31, 2023. On September 13, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to the fluctuations in variable interest rates. The swap effectively exchanged the interest rate on of the debt outstanding under our Term Loan from variable LIBOR to a fixed rate of per annum, in each case plus an applicable margin. The interest rate swap matured on July 10, 2023. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments . On January 31, 2023, we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to the fluctuations in variable interest rates.

On January 31, 2023, we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million. Neither swap was designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. The swaps effectively change the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed rates. The fair value of outstanding interest rate swap derivatives can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total notional amount of swap derivatives outstanding and fluctuations in market interest rates compared to the interest rates fixed by the swap. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our outstanding interest rate swap agreements contained a notional amount of million and million, respectively, with million that matured on July 10, 2023, and million maturing on January 31, 2025. Credit Risk. By using derivative instruments to economically hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of a counterparty to perform under the terms of a derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, we do not possess credit risk. We minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties. We have entered into netting agreements, including International Swap Dealers Association ISDA Agreements, which allow for netting of contract receivables and payables in the event of default by either party.

In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our reportable segments in connection with the realignment of our internal organization and management structure. The segment changes reflect the focus of our CODM on the range of services we provide to our end user markets. Our CODM regularly reviews our operating and financial performance based on these new segments. The current reportable segments include the Utilities segment and the Energy segment, which is made up of our former Energy/Renewables and Pipeline segments. Each of our reportable segments is composed of similar business units that specialize in services unique to the segment. Driving the end-user focused segments are differences in the economic characteristics of each segment, the nature of the services provided by each segment; the production processes of each segment, the type or class of customer using the segment s services, the methods used by the segment to provide the services, and the regulatory environment of each segment s customers. The classification of revenue and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in multiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses, were made. The following is a brief description of the reportable segments: The Utilities segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services, including the installation and maintenance of new and existing natural gas and electric utility distribution and transmission systems, and communications systems. The Energy segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada and specializes in a range of services that include engineering, procurement, and construction, retrofits, highway and bridge construction, demolition, site work, soil stabilization, mass excavation, flood control, upgrades, repairs, outages, pipeline construction and maintenance, pipeline integrity services, and maintenance services for entities in the renewable energy and energy storage, renewable fuels, and petroleum and petrochemical industries, as well as state departments of transportation.

Contributions during 2023 were higher than 2022 as a result of a greater number of man-hours worked by our union labor and the acquisition of PLH. The financial risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following respects: Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in the plan, a withdrawal liability may be created based on the unfunded vested benefits for all employees in the plan.

This Policy is effective as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ). 1. Definitions 
 (a) Accounting Restatement means a requirement that the Company prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. Changes to the Company s financial statements that do not represent error corrections are not an Accounting Restatement, including: (A) retrospective application of a change in accounting principle; (B) retrospective revision to reportable segment information due to a change in the structure of the Company s internal organization; (C) retrospective reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (D) retrospective application of a change in reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under common control; and (E) retrospective revision for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in capital structure.
 (b) Committee means the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board ).
 (c) Covered Person means a person who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation.
 (d) Erroneously Awarded Compensation means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that was Received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Person or by the Company on the Covered Person s behalf. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be based on a reasonable estimate by the Committee of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received. The Company will maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to NYSE.

 (f) Financial Reporting Measures means (A) measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures (whether or not such measures are presented within the Company s financial statements or included in a filing made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), (B) stock price and (C) total shareholder return. 
 (g) Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.
 (h) Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed to be Received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period or is subject to additional time-based vesting requirements.
 (i) Recovery Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of: (A) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; or (B) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. In addition, if there is a change in the Company s fiscal year end, the Recovery Period will also include any transition period to the extent required by Section 303A.14.
 2. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation 
 Subject to the terms of this Policy and the requirements of Section 303A.14, if the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company will attempt to recover, reasonably promptly from each Covered Person, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Received by such Covered Person during the Recovery Period pursuant to Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to this Policy. 3. Interpretation and Administration 
 (a) Role of the Committee . This Policy will be interpreted by the Committee in a manner that is consistent with Section 303A.14 and any other applicable law and will otherwise 

 2 ACTIVEUS 201173858v.1 

be interpreted in the business judgment of the Committee. All decisions and interpretations of the Committee that are consistent with Section 303A.14 will be final and binding. 
 (b) Compensation Not Subject to this Policy . This Policy does not apply to Incentive-Based Compensation that was Received before the Effective Date. With respect to any Covered Person, this Policy does not apply to Incentive-Based Compensation that was Received by such Covered Person before beginning service as an Executive Officer.
 (c) Determination of Means of Recovery . Subject to the requirement that recovery be made reasonably promptly, the Committee will determine the appropriate means of recovery, which may vary between Covered Persons or based on the nature of the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation, and which may involve, without limitation, establishing a deferred repayment plan or setting off against current or future compensation otherwise payable to the Covered Person. Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be made without regard to income taxes paid by the Covered Person or by the Company on the Covered Person s behalf in connection with such Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 (d) Determination That Recovery is Impracticable . The Company is not required to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation if a determination is made by the Committee that either (A) after the Company has made and documented a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered or (B) recovery of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the registrant, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder.
 (e) No Indemnification or Company-Paid Insurance . The Company will not indemnify any Covered Person against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and will not pay or reimburse any Covered Person for the purchase of a third-party insurance policy to fund potential recovery obligations.
 (f) Interaction with Other Clawback Provisions . The Company will be deemed to have recovered Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with this Policy to the extent the Company actually receives such amounts pursuant to any other Company policy, program or agreement, pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or otherwise.
 (g) No Limitation on Other Remedies . Nothing in this Policy will be deemed to limit the Company s right to terminate employment of any Covered Person, to seek recovery of other compensation paid to a Covered Person, or to pursue other rights or remedies available to the Company under applicable law.
 Adopted by the Board on November 2, 2023.
