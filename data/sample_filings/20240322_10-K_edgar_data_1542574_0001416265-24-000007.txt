PMI ), a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Prosper Funding LLC PFL ), a Delaware limited liability company; we, us, our, Prosper, and the Company refers to (i) PMI, (ii) its wholly owned subsidiaries, PFL, BillGuard, Inc.

In addition, the unsecured personal loans originated through our marketplace are referred to as Borrower Loans, and the borrower payment dependent notes issued through our marketplace, whether issued by PMI or PFL, are referred to as Notes. Investors currently invest in Borrower Loans through two channels: (i) the Note Channel, which allows investors to purchase Notes from PFL, the payments of which are dependent on the payments made on the corresponding Borrower Loan; and (ii) the Whole Loan Channel, which allows accredited and institutional investors to purchase Borrower Loans in their entirety directly from PFL. The Notes available to Note Channel investors are distinguishable from notes held by certain third party investors pursuant to Prosper s securitization transactions, which are referred to herein as Notes Issued by Securitization Trust. Finally, although historically the Company has referred to investors as lender members, PFL calls them investors herein to avoid confusion since WebBank is the lender for Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace.

 This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as may, believe, expect, project, estimate, intend, anticipate, plan, continue or similar expressions. These statements may appear throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled Business, Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
 
 The following include some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated: 
 the performance of the Notes, which, in addition to being speculative investments, are special, limited obligations that are not guaranteed or insured; 
 PFL s ability to make payments on the Notes, including in the event that borrowers fail to make payments on the corresponding Borrower Loans; 
 our ability to attract potential borrowers and investors to our personal loan marketplace, and borrowers to our unsecured credit card Credit Card product, and secured digital home equity line of credit and home equity loan (together, the Home Equity Products 
 the reliability of the information about borrowers that is supplied by borrowers including actions by some borrowers to defraud investors; 
 our ability to service the Borrower Loans, and our ability or the ability of a third party debt collector to pursue collection against any borrower, including in the event of fraud or identity theft; 
 credit risks posed by the credit worthiness of borrowers of our Personal Loan and Credit Card products and the effectiveness of our credit rating systems; 
 potential efforts by state regulators or litigants to impose liability that could affect PFL s (or any subsequent assignee s) ability to continue to charge to borrowers the interest rates that they agreed to pay at origination of their loans; 
 the impact of future economic conditions on the performance of the Notes and the loss rates for the Notes; 
 the growth and performance of the recently-launched Credit Card product and the Home Equity Products;

our compliance with applicable local, state and federal law, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other laws; 
 our compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory developments or court decisions affecting our business; 
 potential efforts by state regulators or litigants to characterize PFL or PMI, rather than WebBank, as the lender of the loans originated through our marketplace; 
 the application of federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws to borrowers and to PFL and PMI; 
 the impact of borrower delinquencies, defaults and prepayments on the returns on the Notes; 
 the impact of rising interest rates and inflation on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects; 
 the lack of a public trading market for the Notes and the current lack of any trading platform on which investors can resell the Notes; 
 the federal income tax treatment of an investment in the Notes and the PMI Management Rights; 
 our ability to prevent security breaches, disruptions in service, and comparable events that could compromise the personal and confidential information held on our data systems, reduce the attractiveness of the platform or adversely impact our ability to service Borrower Loans; and 
 the other risks discussed under the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 There may be other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them does occur, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.

PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 Our vision is to transform lives by providing affordable financial solutions through the simplest and most trusted platform. We currently offer access to three lending products, each of which supports our vision: (i) unsecured personal loans through a personal loan marketplace which connects eligible consumer borrowers with individual and institutional investors, (ii) a Credit Card product available to eligible borrowers, and (iii) secured Home Equity Products available to eligible homeowners. 
 Personal Loan 
 We are a pioneer of peer-to-peer lending in the U.S. and first launched our personal loan lending product in 2006. Our personal loan marketplace facilit ated 2.2 billion in Borrower Loan originations during 2023 and 25.6 billion in Bor rower Loan originations since launch. 
 We believe our business model has key advantages relative to traditional banks, including (i) an innovative marketplace model that efficiently connects qualified supply and demand of capital, (ii) online operations that substantially reduce the need for physical infrastructure and improve convenience, and (iii) use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence to deliver simple, fast, personalized, and transparent solutions that can improve consumers financial health as they move across the credit spectrum. We do not operate physical branches or incur expenses related to infrastructure like traditional banks or consumer finance institutions. As part of operating our marketplace, we verify the identity of borrowers and assess borrowers credit risk profile using a combination of public and proprietary data. Our proprietary technology automates several loan origination and servicing functions, including the borrower application process, data gathering, underwriting, credit scoring, loan funding, investing and servicing, regulatory compliance and fraud detection. 
 To consumer borrowers, we believe that we offer generally better pricing, on average, than the pricing those loan borrowers would pay on outstanding credit card balances or unsecured installment loans from a traditional lender. To individual and institutional investors, we offer an asset class (personal loans) that we believe has attractive risk adjusted returns, transparency, and lower duration risk. 
 Our personal loan marketplace offers fixed rate, fully amortizing, unsecured personal loans ranging from 2,000 to 50,000 with no prepayment penalty. Loan term s of 24, 36, 48 and 60 months are available, dep ending in large part upon the Prosper Rating assigned to the borrower at issuance and loan amount being sought. All Borrower Loans are originated and funded by WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial bank organized under the laws of Utah. After origination, WebBank sells the Borrower Loans to PFL, which either holds them or sells them to accredited institutional investors. 
 Investors invest in Borrower Loans through two channels (i) the Note Channel, which allows investors to purchase Notes from PFL, the payments of which are dependent on PFL s receipt of payments made on the corresponding Borrower Loan; and (ii) the Whole Loan Channel, which allows accredited institutional investors to purchase a Borrower Loan in its entirety directly from PFL. PFL continues to own the Borrower Loans originated through the Note Channel. We service all of the Borrower Loans made through our marketplace. 
 Credit Card 
 In December 2021, we launched our Prosper Credit Card product in partnership with Coastal Community Bank Coastal ), through which eligible consumers are extended unsecured credit through Prosper-branded Credit Cards. In accordance with our program agreement with Coastal, the receivables associated with these Credit Cards are maintained on the balance sheet of Coastal. Customer accounts are then randomly designated as either Prosper Allocations or Coastal Allocations on an approximate 90 to 10 split, respectively. Each party receives 100 of the interest income and is responsible for the credit losses on its allocated customer accounts. Credit Card receivables are not available for investment purposes. 
 Home Equity 
 We launched the HELOC product and the HELoan product in March 2019 and October 2022, respectively. Currently, we partner with Spring EQ, LLC and Citizens Bank, N.A. (collectively, our Home Lending Partners to provide a variety of Home Equity services, including accepting online applications, counseling and non-counseling services, and verification, technology and processing services. The Home Equity Products are available through our website in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Neither of the Home Equity Products are available for investment purposes.

Segment Reporting 
 We have three reportable segments: Personal Loan, Home Equity and Credit Card. 
 Company Background and History 
 PMI was incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 22, 2005. PFL was formed as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware on February 17, 2012, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PMI. 
 PMI developed our personal loan marketplace and, until February 1, 2013, owned the proprietary technology that makes operation of our personal loan marketplace possible. On February 1, 2013, PMI transferred the personal loan marketplace to PFL. PFL has been organized and is operated in a manner that is intended (i) to minimize the likelihood that it will become subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and (ii) to minimize the likelihood that, in the event of PMI s bankruptcy, PFL would be substantively consolidated with PMI and thus have its assets subjected to claims of PMI s creditors. We believe we have achieved this by imposing through PFL s organizational documents and covenants in the Amended and Restated Indenture (as defined below in Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence certain restrictions on PFL s activities and certain formalities designed to reinforce PFL s status as a distinct entity from PMI. In addition, under the Administration Agreement, dated February 1, 2013, between PMI and PFL (as amended to date, the Administration Agreement ), PMI has agreed, in its dealings with PFL and with third parties, to observe certain separateness covenants related to its corporate formalities. PMI has also adopted resolutions limiting its own activities and interactions with PFL in order to further reduce the likelihood that PFL would be substantively consolidated with PMI in the event of PMI s bankruptcy. 
 PFL has retained PMI, pursuant to the Administration Agreement, to provide certain administrative services relating to our personal loan marketplace. Specifically, the Administration Agreement contains a license granted by PFL to PMI that entitles PMI to use the marketplace for and in relation to: (i) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations under the Administration Agreement relating to corporate administration, loan platform services, loan and Note servicing, and marketing, and (ii) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations to WebBank in relation to loan origination and funding. The license is terminable in whole or in part upon the failure by PMI to pay PFL the licensing fee, or upon PMI s termination as the provider of some or all of the aforementioned services. See Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Prosper Marketplace, Inc. Agreements with PFL for more information. 
 How our Personal Loan Marketplace Works 
 Our personal loan marketplace is an online marketplace that matches individuals who wish to obtain unsecured personal loans with individuals and institutions who are willing to commit funds to those loans. A borrower who wishes to obtain a loan through our marketplace must apply and, if accepted, post a loan listing to our marketplace. Each time we post a group of listings on our personal loan marketplace, we determine the relative proportions of such listings that will be allocated to the Note Channel and the Whole Loan Channel, respectively, based on our estimate of the relative overall demand in each channel. We then use a random allocation methodology to allocate individual listings between the two channels based on those proportions. If a listing receives enough investor commitments, WebBank will originate the Borrower Loan requested and then sell it to PFL. 
 Borrowers 
 Any natural person at least 18 years of age who is a U.S. resident in a state where loans through our marketplace are available with a U.S. bank account and a social security number may apply to become a borrower. All potential borrowers are subject to anti-fraud, anti-terrorism and identity verification processes and a potential borrower cannot obtain a loan without passing those processes. 
 When a borrower requests a loan, we first evaluate whether the borrower meets the underwriting criteria required by WebBank. WebBank originates loans to borrowers and then sells and assigns the loans to PFL. The underwriting criteria apply to all Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace and may not be changed without WebBank s consent. For the Note Channel, all borrowers who request a loan are subject to the following minimum eligibility criteria: (1) have at least a 600 FICO 08 score, (2) have nine or fewer credit bureau inquiries (after excluding duplicate inquiries) within the last 6 months, (3) have an annual income greater than 0, (4) have a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 50 , (5) have at least two open trades reported on their credit report, and (6) have not filed for bankruptcy within the last 12 months. 
 We also allow two borrowers to apply together as joint applicants for a co-borrower loan. We currently offer loans with 36-month and 60-month terms to co-borrowers, although we may additionally choose to offer loans with 24-month and 48-month terms to co-borrowers in the future. Each borrower applicant is held jointly and severally liable for the obligations under the loan. In the case of co-borrower loans, the primary (or specified borrower must satisfy the following minimum eligibility criteria: (1) have at least a 640 FICO 08 score, (2) have fewer than five credit bureau inquiries (after excluding duplicate 
 7 

inquiries) within the last 6 months, (3) have an annual income greater than 0, (4) have a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 50 (the debt-to-income ratio for joint loans is calculated using the combined debt-to-income ratio of the primary and secondary borrowers without duplication of combined debt), (5) have at least three open trades reported on their credit report, and (6) have not filed for bankruptcy within the last 12 months. 
 
 In addition, a borrower may have up to two loans through Prosper outstanding at one time, provided that (1) the first loan is current, (2) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of both loans does not exceed the then-current maximum allowable loan amount for loans (currently 50,000), (3) the borrower has held their first Borrower Loan for at least 6 months, and (4) the borrower complies with the prior-borrower constraints below. For co-borrower loans, the foregoing additional requirements will apply if either the primary or secondary borrower has a currently outstanding loan. 
 
 If a borrower has previously obtained a Borrower Loan through our marketplace, then in addition to the foregoing requirements (as applicable), the borrower must also (1) have no prior charge-offs on Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace, and (2) have never been more than 15 days delinquent on any Borrower Loan obtained through our marketplace within 12 months of their application. 
 
 From time to time, we have, with WebBank s consent, tested new products that include features which are outside the standard eligibility criteria discussed above. These products are available exclusively through our Whole Loan Channel. 
 Investors 
 Investors are individuals and institutions that have the opportunity to buy Notes or Borrower Loans after registering on our personal loan marketplace. However, investors do not have the ability to invest in Credit Card and Home Equity Products on our personal loan marketplace. An individual investor must be a natural person at least 18 years of age and a U.S. resident, must provide their social security number, and may be required to provide their state driver s license or state identification card number. An institutional investor must provide its taxpayer identification number and entity formation documentation. All potential investors are subject to anti-fraud, anti-terrorism and identity verification processes and a potential investor cannot invest in Notes or Borrower Loans without passing those processes. 
 At the time an individual investor registers to participate in the Note Channel, such investor must satisfy any minimum financial suitability standards established for the Note Channel by the state in which the investor resides. Investors who participate in the Note Channel must enter into an investor registration agreement, which governs all sales of Notes to such investors. 
 Only investors who are approved by us are eligible to participate in the Whole Loan Channel. At a minimum, to participate in the Whole Loan Channel, an investor must meet the definition of an accredited investor set forth in Regulation D under the Securities Act. Investors who participate in the Whole Loan Channel must enter into loan purchase and loan servicing agreements with us. 
 Individual investors can also create a Prosper IRA account to invest in our marketplace using tax-deferred funds from an individual retirement account IRA ). Prosper IRA accounts are not maintained on our personal loan marketplace. Rather, Prosper IRA accounts are managed by third-party custodians who direct Prosper to make deposits and withdrawals to the individual s Prosper IRA account on behalf of the investor and/or their beneficiaries and who ensure IRA accounts remain compliant with applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service IRS regulations. Investors have the ability to select their third-party custodian or utilize a Prosper preferred third-party custodian partner for account management purposes. 
 Relationship with WebBank 
 WebBank is an FDIC-insured, Utah-chartered industrial bank that originates all Borrower Loans made through our personal loan marketplace. WebBank and PMI are parties to an agreement under which PMI manages the operations of our marketplace that relate to the submission of loan applications by borrowers and the making of related Borrower Loans by WebBank in exchange for a fee. WebBank makes each Borrower Loan with its own funds. A joint WebBank-Prosper Credit Policy, which can be changed only with WebBank s approval, constitutes the policy we must follow in reviewing, approving and administering Borrower Loans made by WebBank through the marketplace. WebBank, PMI and PFL are parties to a Loan Sale Agreement, under which WebBank sells and assigns the promissory notes evidencing the Borrower Loans to PFL. As consideration for WebBank's agreement to sell and assign the promissory notes, PFL pays WebBank the purchase price of the promissory notes, as well as a monthly fee, which is partially tied to the terms and performance of the loans. PMI receives payments from WebBank as compensation for the activities it undertakes on WebBank's behalf.

Risk Management 
 Each loan listing is assigned a letter grade that indicates the expected level of risk associated with the listing, which we refer to as a Prosper Rating. Each Prosper Rating corresponds to an estimated average annualized loss rate range. The Prosper Rating associated with a loan listing reflects the loss expectations for that listing as of the time the rating is given. This means that otherwise similar borrowers may have different Prosper Ratings at different points in time as the Prosper Rating is updated to incorporate more recent information. 
 The estimated average annualized loss rate for each loan listing is based primarily on the historical performance of Borrower Loans with similar characteristics and is primarily determined by the following scores: (i) one or more custom Prosper scores Prosper Score ), as may be supplemented by additional proprietary scoring models, and (ii) a credit score obtained from a credit reporting agency. A Prosper Score is also updated periodically to include new information that is predictive of borrower risk as such information becomes available or as the evidence supporting a particular variable becomes strong enough to merit its inclusion in a Prosper Score. 
 To create a Prosper Score, we have developed and refined custom, artificial intelligence driven risk models using our historical data as well as a data archive from a consumer credit bureau. We built the Prosper Score models on our borrower population, and included information provided directly by the borrowers as well as information from their credit reports and other data sources, so that the models would incorporate behavior that is unique to that population. In addition to a Prosper Score, another major element used to determine the Prosper Rating for a loan listing is a credit score from a consumer reporting agency. We currently use either or both of TransUnion s FICO08 score and VantageScore. We obtain a borrower s credit score at the time the loan listing is created, unless we already have a credit score on file that is not more than thirty days old. 
 Sale of Notes and Borrower Loans 
 If an investor successfully bids on a loan listing, the principal amount of the loan will be set aside in the investor s account and may not be used for other bids. In the event a listing does not result in a loan being originated, the funds are again made available for bidding by the investor. 
 For loan listings allocated to the Note Channel, a bid on a listing is an investor s commitment to purchase a Note from PFL. PFL generally issues and sells a series of Notes for each Borrower Loan that is originated through the Note Channel. The Notes are sold to the investors who successfully bid on the corresponding loan listing in the principal amounts of their respective bids. Each series of Notes is dependent for payment on PFL s receipt of payments on the corresponding Borrower Loan. PFL uses the proceeds of each series of Notes to purchase the corresponding Borrower Loan from WebBank on the second business day after WebBank has originated the Borrower Loan. Each Note comes attached with an inseparable PMI Management Right issued by PMI. Each PMI Management Right constitutes an "investment contract," a concept under federal securities law that refers to an arrangement where investors invest money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits, primarily from the efforts of others. 
 Generally, for listings allocated to the Whole Loan Channel, a bid on a listing is an investor s commitment to purchase the Borrower Loan from PFL after origination by WebBank and sale to PFL. On the second business day after WebBank has originated the Borrower Loan, PFL purchases the Borrower Loan from WebBank and re-sells the Borrower Loan that same day to the corresponding investor. In some cases, certain investors in the Whole Loan Channel purchase Borrower Loans that WebBank retains beyond the second business day. PFL records the investor as the owner of the Borrower Loan. 
 Loan Servicing and Collection 
 We are responsible for servicing the Borrower Loans made through our personal loan marketplace. We will pay each Note holder principal and interest on the Note in an amount equal to each such Note s pro-rata portion of the principal and interest payments, if any, which we receive on the corresponding Borrower Loan, net of our servicing fee. We will also pay Note holders their pro-rata portion of any other amounts we receive on the corresponding Borrower Loans, including late fees and prepayments, subject to our servicing fee; provided, that we will not pay Note holders any non-sufficient funds fees we receive for failed borrower payments. In addition, the funds available for payment on the Notes will be reduced by the amount of any attorneys fees or collection fees we, a third-party servicer or a collection agency imposes in connection with collection efforts related to the corresponding Borrower Loan. We will have no further obligation to make payments on any Note after its final maturity date. 
 We will pay each investor who has purchased a Borrower Loan through the Whole Loan Channel principal and interest on the Borrower Loan purchased in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments, if any, that we receive, net of our servicing fee. We will also pay these investors any other amounts we receive on the Borrower Loans, including late fees and prepayments, subject to our servicing fee, provided that we will not pay these investors any non-sufficient funds fees we receive for failed borrower payments or any payment processing fees we may collect. In addition, the funds available for payment on 
 9 

the Borrower Loans will be reduced by the amount of any attorneys' fees or collection fees we, a third-party servicer or a collection agency imposes in connection with collection efforts related to the Borrower Loan. 
 If a Borrower Loan becomes past due, we may collect on it directly or refer it to a third-party collection agency. Our in-house collections department and third-party collection agencies are compensated by keeping a portion of the payments they collect based on a predetermined schedule. 
 Customers 
 A relatively small number of investors provide the funding commitments for a large percentage of all listings that result in Borrower Loans originated through our personal loan marketplace. Of all Borrower Loans originated in the year ended December 31, 2023, the largest party purchased a total of 15.1 of th ose loans. 
 Industry Background and Trends 
 According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as of December 2023, the balance of outstanding consumer credit (excluding loans secured by real estate) in the United States totale d 5.0 trillion. This amount included 1.3 trillion of revolving consumer credit, primarily credit card, and 3.7 trillion of non-revolving loans. A portion of the revolving balances are also refinanced by consumers at lower interest rates and fixed terms through personal loans. 
 
 The market for consumer lending is competitive and rapidly evolving, and there is an opportunity for our business model to transform the traditional lending process. We believe our marketplace offers a superior solution for both borrowers and investors. 
 For borrowers, we believe our marketplace offers the following principal competitive factors: better terms versus other alternatives; a simple, easy and intuitive customer experience; a fast and efficient process; and trust and transparency. 
 For investors, we believe our marketplace offers the following principal competitive factors: attractive risk-adjusted returns; low duration risk; diversification from other asset classes; a simple, easy and intuitive customer experience; and trust and transparency. 
 Competition 
 We compete for borrowers and investors against other financial products and companies. For borrowers, our competition includes banking institutions, credit unions, credit card issuers, mortgage and home equity lenders, and other online consumer lending companies, including publicly traded companies such as LendingClub Corporation, Social Finance Inc., and Upstart Holdings, Inc. For investors in our personal loan product, our competition includes other consumer lending platforms, alternative asset funds, and asset classes such as equities, bonds and commodities. We may also face potential competition from new market entrants, or business expansion from established companies. These companies may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their offerings. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with sustainable competitive advantages: 
 Leading Online Personal Loan Marketplace . Since inception, our personal loan marketplace has f acilitated 25.6 billion in loan originations, of which 2.2 billion was for the year-ended December 31, 2023. As our business grows, our brand, reputation and scale strengthens. This allows us to attract top talent, speed up product innovati on, launch additional consumer finance products, attract marketplace participants and drive down our cost structure, all of which further benefit borrowers and investors. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 54.5 of Borrower Loans originated from borrowers who previously borrowed on our personal loan marketplace, evidence of our strong customer experience. 
 Robust Network Effect . The attractiveness of our personal loan marketplace increases as the number of participants on our marketplace increases, yielding a classic network effect. Our personal loan marketplace offers consumer borrowers access to affordable credit, and allows individual and institutional investors to invest in an asset class with attractive risk-adjusted returns. The diversity of investors brings scale and breadth of funding to our marketplace and makes credit more affordable. As both sides of the equation grow, the advantages (reduced risk, lower cost) scale accordingly, attracting even more borrowers and investors. The increased participant pool reduces costs and generates more data which we use to improve the effectiveness of our credit decisioning and scoring models. This enhances our aggregate loan performance and builds increased trust in our marketplace, which in turn attracts more borrowers and investors. 
 10 

We believe our strength in the personal loan marketplace will also attract customers to seek out the Credit Card and Home Equity Products. 
 Technology Platform . Our technology platform automates key aspects of our operations, including the borrower application process, data gathering, underwriting, credit scoring, loan funding, investing and servicing, regulatory compliance and fraud detection. This provides a significant time and cost advantage over traditional consumer lending business models and, we believe, enables us to provide a superior user experience to our customers. Using our accumulated performance data, we continually invest in incremental improvements in our algorithms thus extending our technological advantage. 
 Proprietary Risk Management Capabilities . We have developed artificial intelligence driven proprietary risk models based on personal loan and credit card performance data, which we believe allows us to accurately assess the credit risk profile of borrowers and which we believe also allows investors to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns. We leverage the results from our growing data stream to continually refine these artificial intelligence driven risk models and more accurately predict credit performance. 
 Unique Corporate Structure . Our corporate structure was designed to offer our investors extra protection. The organization and operation of PFL and PMI as separate and distinct entities should serve to protect our Note investors in the event of a bankruptcy filing by or against PMI. This organizational structure, along with the federal and state registration process, is expensive and time consuming to undertake, and is not easily duplicated by competitors. 
 Efficient and Attractive Financial Model . We have multiple revenue streams and an efficient cost model. For personal loans, we generate revenue from transaction fees from our marketplace s role in matching borrowers with investors to enable loan originations, servicing fees related to Borrower Loans for which we retain the servicing rights, net interest income from Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, credit referral fees and other ancillary revenue sources. We also earn revenue from transaction fees generated by our Home Equity Products and interest income and a variety of fees provided under the Credit Card program, including interchange fees, annual fees and late fees, net of a program fee and a portion of the interchange fees that must be remitted to Coastal. Additionally, our technology platform significantly reduces the need for physical infrastructure and therefore allows our business to grow with a lower cost operating model, providing us with significant operating leverage. 
 Sources of Revenues 
 We earn revenue in a variety of ways from our personal loan, Credit Card, and Home Equity Products. We have three primary sources of personal loan revenues: transaction fees, servicing fees, and net interest income. We earn transaction fees from WebBank by facilitating the origination of Borrower Loans through the personal loan marketplace, and we earn servicing fees from investors for processing principal and interest payments made by borrowers and passing such payments on to investors and also earn net interest income from Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale. We also earn revenue from interest income and various fees generated by our Credit Card program, including interchange fees, annual fees and late fees, net of program fees and a portion of the interchange fees that must be remitted to Coastal. Finally, we earn revenue from our Home Equity Products through broker fees paid by our Home Lending Partners. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to attract individuals and institutions to our products, encourage their enrollment and participation as users, and facilitate and enhance their understanding and utilization of each product. We employ a wide range of marketing channels to reach potential customers and build our brand and value proposition. These channels include referrals, online marketing, direct mail, partner and affiliate introductions, and email. We are constantly seeking new methods to reach more potential members, while testing and optimizing the end-to-end customer experience. 
 Origination and Servicing 
 We have efficient and scalable systems for credit risk assessment, loan underwriting, and servicing of the Borrower Loans and Credit Card product. Our risk models take borrowers supplied information and combine that information with public and proprietary data to make real time decisions. Our verification agents use several tools to efficiently verify borrower information. Our personal loan servicing platform calculates a loan s amortization and processes payments received from borrowers and passes such payments on to investors. In addition, we have a back-up servicing agreement for personal loans with Vervent, Inc. Vervent ), a loan servicing company that is willing and able to assume servicing responsibilities in the event that we are no longer able to service the Borrower Loans and Notes. Vervent is a financial services company that has entered into numerous successor loan servicing agreements.

Technology 
 We have made, and continue to make, substantial investment in our customer acquisition capability, customer experience, and credit underwriting, loan servicing and payment systems. Our personal loan marketplace utilizes proprietary software to process electronic cash movements, record book entries and calculate cash balances in users funding accounts. Electronic deposits and payments are mostly done via Automated Clearing House ACH transactions. The technology platform allows us to economically acquire and service Borrower Loans and Notes and allows WebBank to efficiently originate and fund Borrower Loans. 
 The system hardware for our personal loan marketplace is located in hosting facilities in Scottsdale, Arizona, Las Vegas, Nevada, The Dalles, Oregon and Council Bluffs, Iowa. We own the hardware deployed in support of our personal loan marketplace. We continuously monitor the performance and availability of our marketplace. The infrastructure is scalable and utilizes standard techniques such as load-balancing and redundancies. 
 Key aspects of our technology include: 
 Scalability . Our personal loan marketplace is designed and built as a real-time, highly scalable, multi-tier, redundant system. It incorporates technologies designed to prevent any single point of failure within the data center from taking the entire system offline. This is achieved by utilizing load-balancing technologies at the front end and business layer tiers and clustering technologies in the back-end tiers to allow scaling both horizontally and vertically depending on marketplace utilization. 
 Data Integrity and Security . We are committed to protecting our users' information and we take the integrity and security of the data provided by them very seriously. To that end, we have established data protection policies which are implemented and enforced using the latest technologies. All sensitive information is transmitted on secure channels using SSL technology, with SSL certificates issued by Symantec or DigiCert. We employ principles of least privilege and layered security to protect stored sensitive information. Sensitive information at rest is encrypted using industry standard encryption technologies with appropriate controls to access the data. We protect the network perimeter using the latest technologies including but not limited to firewall and anti-virus threat management techniques. We use strong multi-factor authentication to protect and monitor remote access. We back up all data securely and would expect to recover operations in a short period of time in the event of a disaster. Logging and monitoring of the systems and security controls are designed to ensure that the controls are functional and that alerts are triggered on security violations. 
 Fraud Detection . We employ a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies and solutions to prevent and detect fraud. These include knowledge-based authentication, behavioral analytics and digital fingerprinting to prevent identity fraud. We use services from third-party vendors for user identification, credit checks and for checking customer names against the list of Specially Designated Nationals and other lists maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). In addition, we use specialized third-party software to augment the identity fraud detection systems. We also have a dedicated team which conducts additional investigations of cases flagged for high fraud risk. Finally, we enable users to report suspicious activity, which we may then evaluate further. 
 Targeted Risk Assessment . Our risk models, which utilize artificial intelligence via machine learning, include flags and characteristics which are unique to our platform. We believe these models result in a risk assessment that is more targeted and accurate than traditional models, leading to higher approval rates and highly automated identity and income verification. We are continuing to enhance the technology embedded within our models to facilitate and improve access to credit and the application experience for borrowers. We have been building and enhancing these machine learning models since 2015. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, and other rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and service providers, and through these and other written agreements, attempt to control access to and distribution of the software, documentation and other proprietary technology and information. We also utilize a robust multi-layered monitoring program, including third party domain monitoring services, web search engine alerts and our outside counsel, which we leverage to actively enforce our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an authorized or unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality. Policing all unauthorized use of intellectual property rights is nearly impossible. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriations of our technology or intellectual property rights.

We have registered several trademarks in the United States, including Prosper , FAAS , Make Healthcare Affordable , Powered by Prosper and numerous stylized marks, including the Prosper and Prosper Healthcare Lending logos. 
 We have invested in a research and development program and, as of December 31, 2023, we had eight issued patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We may file additional patent applications or pursue additional patent protection in the future to the extent we believe it will be beneficial. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 Employee Profile 
 At Prosper, our mission is to advance financial well-being and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. We are committed to hiring and developing employees who embody our core values: accountability, collaboration, excellence, curiosity, diversity, simplicity, and integrity. As of December 31, 2023, we h ad 404 full-time employees, all of whom were based in the United States. Our employees are classified as either local to either our San Francisco, California and Phoenix, Arizona offices or remote national if they work remotely. As of December 31, 2023, we had 139 local employees based in our San Francisco, California office, 134 local employees based in our Phoenix, Arizona office, and 131 remote national employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions. We have not experi enced any work stoppages, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
 Employee Health Wellness 
 Our employees have access to several programs and benefits related to employee wellness including: traditional life and health (medical, dental, vision) insurance, flexible paid time off, free membership to physical, mental and emotional health resources, and parental leave programs, among others. We believe our progressive human resources policies, learning and development, talent acquisition, and community engagement and support activities enable us to attract and retain key personnel. 
 Employee Recognition and Talent Development 
 We understand that to attract and retain great people, we must listen to and engage them regularly. We conduct an anonymous, company-wide employee engagement survey twice a year to gauge our progress and identify the areas where we excel and areas for improvement in the employee experience. Following each survey, we identify areas where we would like to focus to support engagement within the company and create action plans to support those initiatives. We have implemented two award programs to recognize and honor our employees who exemplify our values. 
 Because we operate in a highly regulated industry, we require ongoing regulatory and compliance training for our employees. Additionally, we provide a series of leadership training for all people managers. We also offer employees free access to on-demand training on an array of subjects from technical to business management to build their skills and advance their careers as well as opportunities for employees to pursue their passion projects and leadership development in alignment with our values. 
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
 Diversity and collaboration are among our Company s core values and we believe our efforts in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging DEIB fuel our innovation and drive our success. Our goal is to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace where our employees feel that their identities and experiences are represented, embraced and celebrated. We are also committed to our efforts to increase diversity through our hiring practices by using gender-neutral job postings and recruiting policies that promote diverse candidates. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of differences that include gender, ethnicity and other protected traits and it is our policy to comply fully with all federal, state and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. We have several employee resource groups that help us to identify opportunities and actions related to DEIB and to better engage underrepresented populations. Our DEIB principles are also reflected in our employee training, and in particular with respect to our policies against harassment and bullying and the elimination of bias in the workplace. We continue to enhance our DEIB policies, with guidance from our executive leadership team.

Government Regulation 
 Overview 
 The lending and securities industries are highly regulated. Each of the financial products offered by us are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations. We also are subject to licensing and examination by various federal, state and local government authorities. These authorities impose obligations and restrictions on our activities, WebBank s activities and the Borrower Loans acquired and Notes issued through our marketplace, Coastal s activities and the Credit Card product, and our Home Lending Partners and the Home Equity Products. In particular, these rules may limit the fees that may be assessed, require extensive disclosure to, and consents from, borrowers, prohibit discrimination, and impose multiple qualification and licensing obligations on our activities. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, voiding of loan contracts, indemnification liabilities to contract counterparties, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions and civil and criminal liabilities. While compliance with such requirements is at times complicated by our novel business model, we believe we are in substantial compliance with these rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are subject to continuous change, however, and a material change could have an adverse effect on our compliance efforts and ability to operate. 
 
 From time to time, various types of federal and state legislation are proposed and new regulations are introduced that could result in additional regulation of, and restrictions on, the business of consumer lending. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be adopted or how this would affect our business or our important relationships with third parties. In addition, the interpretation of existing legislation may change or may prove different than anticipated when applied to our novel business model. Compliance with such requirements could involve additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of consumer lending in the United States, our business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal and state legislation and regulations that may increase the cost of doing business. 
 Personal Loan State and Federal Laws and Regulations 
 State Licensing Requirements . In most states we believe that WebBank, as originator of all Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace, satisfies any relevant licensing requirements with respect to the origination of such Borrower Loans. In addition, as needed, we seek licenses and/or authorizations of various types so that we may conduct activities such as servicing and marketing in all states and the District of Columbia, with the exceptions of Iowa and West Virginia. We are subject to supervision and examination by the state regulatory authorities that administer these state lending laws. The licensing statutes vary from state to state and prescribe or impose different requirements, including: restrictions on loan origination and servicing practices, limits on finance charges and the type, amount and manner of charging fees; disclosure requirements; requirements that licensees submit to periodic examination; surety bond and minimum specified net worth requirements; periodic financial reporting requirements; notification requirements for changes in principal officers, stock ownership or corporate control; restrictions on advertising; and requirements that loan forms be submitted for review. 
 State Usury Laws . Section 521 of the Depository Institution Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (12 U.S.C. 1831d) DIDA and Section 85 of the National Bank Act NBA (12 U.S.C. 85), federal case law interpreting the NBA such as Tiffany v. National Bank of Missouri and Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First Omaha Service Corporation , and FDIC advisory opinion 92-47 permit FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as WebBank, to export the interest rate permitted under the laws of the state where the bank is located, regardless of the usury limitations imposed by the state law of the borrower s state of residence unless the state has chosen to opt out of the exportation regime. WebBank is located in Utah, and Title 70C of the Utah Code does not limit the amount of fees or interest that may be charged by WebBank on loans of the type offered through our marketplace. Iowa and Puerto Rico have opted out of the exportation regime under Section 525 of DIDA and we do not operate in either jurisdiction. In June 2023, Colorado enacted a DIDA opt-out law which will be effective on July 1, 2024. We believe that judicial interpretations support the view that such opt outs only apply to loans made in those states. 
 In May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the NBA and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. On November 10, 2015, the defendant in the Madden case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court for further review of the Second Circuit s decision. On June 27, 2016, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition and refused to review the case, leaving the decision of the Second Circuit intact and binding on federal courts in Connecticut, New York and Vermont. The Madden decision has created some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest in accordance with the terms of Borrower Loans. While the decision specifically addressed preemption under the NBA, it could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including an FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial bank like WebBank. However, although there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any potential 
 14 

litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on our marketplace, we believe the Madden case addressed facts that are not presented by our marketplace lending platform and thus would not apply to Borrower Loans. 
 In June 2020, the FDIC issued a final regulation entitled Federal Interest Rate Authority that, among other things, addressed the uncertainty resulting from the Madden decision, including uncertainty affecting marketplace lenders that partner with banks. Under the FDIC s rule, which applies to FDIC-insured state-chartered industrial banks such as WebBank, interest on a loan originated by WebBank that was permissible under DIDA at origination is not affected by WebBank s subsequent sale of the loan to PFL. Seven states and the District of Columbia sued the FDIC, however, seeking to have the regulation set aside on Administrative Procedure Act grounds. Three states brought a similar challenge in the same court to a similar regulation issued by the OCC under the NBA. Both suits were decided in February 8, 2022, with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruling that the FDIC and OCC had not exceeded their statutory authority when promulgating their respective rules. The court deferred to each federal agency's interpretation, and thus concluded that each agency s rule was not unreasonable or arbitrary or capricious. The states had until April 11, 2022 to appeal the rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and did not do so. 
 On August 18, 2020, WebBank, the originator and lender of the loans offered through the personal loan marketplace, was among the parties that reached a settlement with the Administrator of the Colorado Uniform Consumer Credit Code which provides a safe harbor for the platforms operated by Marlette Funding, LLC and Avant, Inc., such that if the programs meet certain criteria related to oversight, disclosure, funding, licensing, consumer terms, and structure, the programs will be deemed to be in compliance with Colorado s usury limits. On November 9, 2020, we amended our agreements with WebBank to meet the requirements of the safe harbor for extending credit to borrowers in Colorado. 
 We had separately been in discussions with the Colorado Administrator during the Marlette and Avant litigation regarding certain terms of Borrower Loans offered through the personal loan marketplace to Colorado residents. Effective as of July 30, 2019, we and the Administrator entered into a stipulation (the Stipulation to allow loans to continue to be offered through the personal loan marketplace to Colorado residents, subject to certain financing charge and late fee restrictions during the period that the Stipulation is in effect with respect to acquired loans, but excluding loans retained by WebBank or sold to a state-chartered, FDIC-insured bank or a federally-chartered bank. Effective as of February 6, 2024, we entered into a Stipulation and Final Agency Order FAO pursuant to which Prosper agreed to continue to be subject to such financing charge and late fee restrictions set forth in the Stipulation through July 1, 2024. 
 If a Borrower Loan made through our marketplace was deemed to be subject to the usury laws of a state that has opted-out of the exportation regime or becomes bound by the Second Circuit s or a similar judicial decision (including a judicial decision setting aside the FDIC s regulation governing permissible interest on loans sold by banks to non-banks), we could become subject to fines, penalties, and possible forfeiture of amounts charged to borrowers, and we may decide not to originate Borrower Loans through our marketplace in that applicable jurisdiction, which may adversely impact our growth. For more information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors If our marketplace were found to violate a state s usury laws, we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed. 
 State Securities Laws . We are subject to the securities laws of each state in which the registration or qualification to offer and sell the Notes and PMI Management Rights has been approved. Certain of these state laws require us to renew the registration or qualification of Notes and PMI Management Rights on an annual basis. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for the financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protections by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB ), which has broad authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth-in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions, such as our issuing banks, for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. We are subject to the CFPB s jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority and may become subject to their supervisory authority, as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit. The CFPB may request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities, and also conduct on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis. 
 Truth-in-Lending Act . The federal Truth-in-Lending Act TILA ), and Regulation Z, which implements TILA, require creditors to provide consumers with uniform, understandable information concerning certain terms and conditions of their loan and credit transactions. These rules apply to WebBank as the creditor for Borrower Loans facilitated through our marketplace, but because the transactions are carried out on our hosted website, we facilitate compliance at WebBank s direction. For closed-end credit transactions of the type provided through our marketplace, these disclosures include providing the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the number of payments and the amount of the monthly payment. The creditor must provide the disclosures before the Borrower Loan is closed. TILA also regulates the advertising of 
 15 

credit and gives borrowers, among other things, certain rights regarding updated disclosures and the treatment of credit balances. Our marketplace provides borrowers with a TILA disclosure prior to the time a Borrower Loan is originated. We also seek to comply with TILA s disclosure requirements related to credit advertising. 
 Equal Credit Opportunity Act . The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, or the fact that all or part of the applicant s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or any applicable state law. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from applicants and from making statements that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application. These requirements apply both to lenders such as WebBank and other parties like us that regularly implement and communicate credit decisions. Investors may also be subject to the ECOA in their capacity as purchasers of Notes, if they are deemed to regularly participate in credit decisions. In the underwriting of Borrower Loans on our marketplace, both WebBank and we seek to comply with ECOA s provisions prohibiting discouragement and discrimination. ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers with timely notices of adverse action taken on credit applications. WebBank and we provide prospective borrowers who apply for a Borrower Loan through our marketplace but are denied credit with an adverse action notice which is in compliance with applicable requirements (see also below regarding Fair Credit Reporting Act ). 
 Fair Credit Reporting Act. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA and its implementing regulations, including Regulation V, promote the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. FCRA requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report, and requires persons to report loan payment information to credit bureaus accurately. FCRA also imposes disclosure requirements on creditors who take adverse action on credit applications based on information contained in a credit report. WebBank and we have a permissible purpose for obtaining credit reports on potential borrowers and WebBank and we also obtain explicit consent from borrowers to obtain such reports. As the servicer for the Borrower Loan, we have systems in place to report Borrower Loan payment and delinquency information to appropriate reporting agencies. We provide an adverse action notice to a rejected borrower on WebBank s behalf at the time the borrower is rejected that includes all the required disclosures. We have also implemented an identity theft prevention program as required by law. 
 Fair Debt Collection Practices Act . The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act FDCPA and its implementing regulation, Regulation F, provide guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts. The FDCPA limits certain communications with third parties, imposes notice and debt validation requirements, and prohibits threatening, harassing or abusive conduct in the course of debt collection. We are not a debt collector under the FDCPA, which the statute defines as a person who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due, or asserted to be owed or due, to another. The CFPB retained the statute s debt collector definition in its November 2020 final rules implementing the FDCPA. As the servicer for Borrower Loans originated by WebBank and owned by investors, we are not a debt collector based on our facilitation of loans in the origination process and/or its servicing of the Borrower Loans after the time of origination and prior to any default. While the FDCPA applies to third-party debt collectors, debt collection laws of certain states impose similar requirements on creditors who collect their own debts. Our agreement with our investors prohibits investors from attempting to collect directly on the Borrower Loan. We use our internal collection team and professional external debt collection agents to collect delinquent accounts. They are required to comply with all other applicable laws in collecting delinquent accounts of our borrowers. 
 Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act SCRA allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote their full attention to military duties. The SCRA, as well as certain state laws with similar protections for military members, require us to adjust the interest rate of borrowers who qualify for and request relief. If a borrower with an outstanding Borrower Loan qualifies for protection under the SCRA or similar state laws, we will reduce the interest rate on the Borrower Loan to 6 for the duration of the borrower s active duty. During this period, the investors who have invested in such Borrower Loan will not receive the difference between 6 and the Borrower Loan s original interest rate. For a borrower to obtain an interest rate reduction on a Borrower Loan due to military service, we require the borrower to send us a written request and written documentation of active duty. We do not take military service into account in assigning Prosper Ratings to borrower loan requests and we do not disclose the military status of borrowers to investors. 
 Military Lending Act. The federal Military Lending Act MLA provides specific protections for active duty service members and their dependents (or covered borrowers) in consumer credit transactions. Although originally enacted in 2006, the MLA applies to persons engaged in the business of extending consumer credit subject to the disclosure requirements of the TILA and Regulation Z with respect to loans made on or after October 3, 2016. The MLA prohibits creditors from imposing a Military Annual Percentage Rate MAPR greater than 36 in any consumer credit transaction involving a covered borrower. It also requires certain oral and written disclosures to be provided to covered borrowers. Additionally, the MLA prohibits creditors from requiring covered borrowers to waive rights to legal recourse, submit to arbitration, or pay a prepayment penalty 
 16 

or fee. Both we and WebBank have ensured that the loan program complies with the MLA requirements for covered borrowers, including but not limited to the restriction on MAPR, the delivery of required disclosures and the prohibition of mandatory arbitration and waiver of legal recourse. 
 Other Lending Regulations. We are subject to and seek to comply with other state and federal laws and regulations applicable to consumer lending, including additional requirements relating to loan disclosure, credit discrimination, credit reporting, debt collection and unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices. These laws and regulations may be enforced by state consumer credit regulatory agencies, state attorneys general, the CFPB and private litigants, among others. Given our novel business model and the subjective nature of some of these laws and regulations, particularly laws regulating unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices, we may become subject to regulatory scrutiny or legal challenge with respect to our compliance with these requirements. 
 Electronic Funds Transfer Act . The federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act EFTA ), and Regulation E, which implements it, provide guidelines and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers bank accounts. In addition, transfers performed by ACH electronic transfers are subject to detailed timing and notification rules and guidelines administered by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association NACHA ). Most transfers of funds in connection with the origination and repayment of the Borrower Loans are performed by ACH. We obtain necessary electronic authorization from borrowers and investors for such transfers in compliance with such rules. Transfers of funds through our marketplace are currently executed by Wells Fargo and conform to the EFTA, its regulations and NACHA guidelines. 
 Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act/Uniform Electronic Transactions Act . The federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ESIGN and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act UETA ), authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. ESIGN and UETA require businesses that want to use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions to obtain the consumer s consent to receive information electronically. When a borrower or individual investor registers with our marketplace, we obtain their consent to transact business electronically and maintain electronic records in compliance with ESIGN and UETA requirements. 
 Privacy and Data Security Laws . The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act GLBA limits the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and nonaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal customer information. As of December 31, 2023, a total of thirteen states have passed comprehensive privacy laws in the United States: California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Montana, Oregon, and Delaware. As of December 31, 2023, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia s laws are effective. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), which took effect on January 1, 2020, provides consumers in the state with rights to know about the use, to request deletion and correction, and to opt out of the sale of their personal information by businesses that are a certain size or that generate at least half of their revenue by selling personal information. In turn, the CCPA requires subject businesses to notify consumers of their data collection practices and to implement procedures for timely responding to consumer requests submitted in exercise of their rights under the statute, although the CCPA includes certain exceptions for personal information that is protected under GLBA or other federal and state privacy laws. These provisions of the CCPA were further strengthened by provisions of the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA ), which took effect on January 1, 2023. We maintain a detailed privacy policy that is accessible from our website and is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws. 
 
 In addition, state and federal privacy and data security laws require safeguards to protect the privacy and security of consumers personally identifiable information, require notification to affected customers in the event of a breach, and restrict certain sharing of nonpublic personal information about a consumer with affiliated entities. We maintain security measures designed to protect participants personal information, and we do not sell, rent or share such information with nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes unless previously agreed to by the participant or otherwise permitted by applicable law. In addition, we take a number of measures to safeguard the personal information of our borrowers and investors and to protect it against unauthorized access. 
 Bank Secrecy Act . In cooperation with WebBank, we have implemented an anti-money laundering policy and various anti-money laundering procedures to comply with applicable federal law. With respect to new borrowers and investors, we apply the customer identification and verification program rules and screen names against the list of Specially Designated Nationals maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control s OFAC pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act BSA and its implementing regulation. 
 Credit Card State and Federal Laws and Regulations 
 The Credit Card product operates under a similar bank partnership model as our personal loan marketplace, whereby through the application of Section 521 of DIDA, Section 85 of the NBA, and federal case law, Coastal may export the interest rate permitted under the laws of the State of Washington, where Coastal is located, regardless of the usury limitations imposed 
 17 

by the state law of the cardholder s state of residence unless the state has chosen to opt out of the exportation regime. State privacy and data security laws such as the CCPA also apply to the Credit Card product. 
 The Credit Card product is subject to the same federal laws and regulations applicable to our personal loan marketplace and as summarized above, including the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA, ECOA, FCRA, FDCPA, SCRA, MLA, EFTA, ESIGN, UETA, GLBA, BSA and OFAC. TILA and Regulation Z contain specific disclosure requirements for credit cards and advertising rules for credit cards. Please refer to the Government Regulations Personal Loan State and Federal Laws and Regulations section above for a summary of these federal laws and regulations. Certain amendments to TILA also govern the Credit Card product, including the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act ), which amended TILA to prescribe, among other things, additional procedures, disclosures, fee limits, and other protections for consumers applying for or holding credit cards, and the Fair Credit Billing Act FCBA ), which governs creditor obligations with respect to billing complaints and errors. For the Credit Card product, we take a similar approach to compliance for our personal loan marketplace, with adjustments for application of the rules to open-ended, unsecured credit cards as opposed to closed-end personal loans. We work with Coastal to facilitate compliance. 
 Home Equity State and Federal Laws and Regulations 
 The Home Equity Products are subject to many of the same federal laws and regulations as the personal loan marketplace, including the Dodd-Frank Act, TILA, ECOA, FCRA, ESIGN, GLBA, BSA and OFAC. TILA, Regulation Z, and applicable state laws contain specific disclosure requirements for the Home Equity Products and mortgage advertising rules. State mortgage broker and mortgage lender licensing and registration requirements also apply to the Home Equity Products, which must satisfy the minimum standards set forth in the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 and Regulation H, as well as state usury laws. State privacy and data security laws such as the CCPA also apply to the Home Equity Products. 
 The Home Equity Products are also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA and its implementing regulation, Regulation X, as well as related guidance issued by the CFPB and the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD ). RESPA, among other things, prohibits the payment or acceptance of referral fees or kickbacks, or any splitting of fees except for actual services performed. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure does not apply to HELOCs, but does apply to HELoans. Prosper does not service any of the Home Equity Products. 
 Finally, the Home Equity Products are subject to the data collection and reporting requirements of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (the HMDA and its implementing regulation, Regulation C. Prosper is not directly subject to the HMDA data collection and reporting requirements, but collects data to support the reporting requirements applicable to its lending partner. 
 Foreign Laws and Regulations 
 We do not permit non-U.S. based individuals to register as borrowers on our marketplace and the marketplace does not operate outside the United States. Therefore, we do not believe that our marketplace is subject to foreign laws or regulations. 
 Summary of Risk Factors 
 We are subject to various risks, the most significant of which are summarized below. For more information about these and other risks that may affect us, you should carefully read the factors described in the Risk Factors section below. 
 
 Risks related to personal loan borrower default 
 
 The Notes are risky and speculative investments suitable only for investors of adequate financial means. 
 Payments on the Notes depend entirely on payments PFL receives on corresponding Borrower Loans. If a borrower fails to make any payments on the corresponding Borrower Loan related to a Note, payments on such Note will be correspondingly reduced. If payments on the Borrower Loan corresponding to an investor s Note become overdue, such investor may not receive the full principal and interest payments that were expected on the Note. 
 Borrowers may not view or treat their obligations to PFL as having the same significance as loans from traditional lending sources. 
 The credit information of an applicant may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the applicant s creditworthiness, which may cause an investor to lose all or part of the price paid for a Note. The fact that we have the exclusive right and ability to investigate claims of identity theft in the origination of Borrower Loans creates a significant conflict of interest between us and our investors. 
 The Borrower Loans are not secured by any collateral or guaranteed or insured by any third party, and investors must rely on us or a third-party collection agency to pursue collection against any borrower. 
 18 

The Prosper Rating may not accurately set forth the risks of investing in the Notes, no assurances can be provided that actual loss rates for the Notes will come within the estimated average annualized loss rates indicated by the Prosper Rating, and investors have limited rights to cause Prosper to repurchase the Notes. 
 We may not set appropriate interest rates for Borrower Loans. 
 Investors who use the Recurring Investment or Auto Invest tools may face additional risk of funding Borrower Loans that have been erroneously selected by the tool. 
 The Borrower Loans do not restrict borrowers from incurring additional unsecured or secured debt, nor do they impose any financial restrictions on borrowers during the term of the Borrower Loan, which may reduce the likelihood that an investor will receive the full principal and interest payments that such investor expects to receive on a Note. 
 In general, the Borrower Loans do not contain any cross-default or similar provisions. If a borrower defaults on any of their other debt obligations, our ability to collect on the Borrower Loan on which an investor s Note is dependent for payment may be substantially impaired. 
 
 Risks Inherent in investing in the Notes 
 
 The Notes are special, limited obligations of PFL only and are not directly secured by any collateral or guaranteed or insured by PMI or any third party. 
 PFL is not obligated to indemnify Note holders or repurchase Notes except in limited circumstances. 
 Our marketplace allows a borrower to prepay a Borrower Loan at any time without penalty. Borrower Loan prepayments will extinguish or limit an investor s ability to receive additional interest payments on a Note. 
 The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and can be held only by registered Prosper investors. Further, no trading platform for the transfer of Notes exists. Therefore, investors should be prepared to hold the Notes they purchase until maturity. 
 Our participation in the funding of Borrower Loans could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest. 
 
 Risks related to PFL and PMI, our marketplace and our ability to service the notes 
 
 Human error in the operation of our platform has resulted in the allocation of Borrower Loans to our Note Channel which did not conform to the eligibility criteria applicable to Borrower Loans at the time of allocation. If we are unable to prevent the reoccurrence of similar errors, our business and investors could be adversely impacted. 
 We have experienced errors on our platform that have resulted in incorrect reporting of performance returns to Note investors. If we are unable to prevent the reoccurrence of similar errors, investors could be adversely impacted. 
 Arrangements for back-up servicing are limited. If PMI fails to maintain operations or the Administration Agreement is rejected or terminated (in bankruptcy or otherwise), investors may experience a delay and increased cost in respect of their expected principal and interest payments on Notes, and PFL may be unable to collect and process repayments from borrowers. 
 PMI, in its capacity as servicer, has the authority to waive or modify the terms of a Borrower Loan without the consent of the Note holders. 
 We have incurred operating losses in prior years and may continue to incur net losses in the future. 
 The Term Loan, and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 PFL relies on a third-party commercial bank to process transactions. If PFL is unable to continue utilizing these services, its business and ability to service the Notes may be adversely affected. 
 Any significant disruption in service in our marketplace or in PMI s computer systems could adversely affect PMI s ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. If the security of PFL s investors and borrowers confidential information stored in our systems is breached, users secure information may be stolen, our reputations may be harmed, and we may be exposed to liability. 
 Increasing interest rates have adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact our business. 
 
 Risks related to compliance and regulation 
 
 Our marketplace represents a novel approach to borrowing and investing that may fail to comply with federal and state securities laws, borrower protection laws and the state counterparts to such consumer protection laws. Borrowers may dispute the enforceability of their obligations under borrower or consumer protection laws after collection actions have commenced, or otherwise seek damages under these laws. Investors may attempt to rescind their Note purchases under securities laws. Regulatory agencies and their state counterparts may investigate our compliance with these regulatory obligations, and may take enforcement action with respect to alleged law violations. There continues to be uncertainty as to how the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or any other new agency could impact our business or that of our issuing bank. If our marketplace were found to violate a state s usury laws, we may have to alter our 
 19 

business model and our business could be harmed. If one or both of PMI and PFL is required to register under the Investment Company Act or the Investment Advisers Act, either of our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected. Several lawsuits have sought to recharacterize certain loan marketers and other originators as lenders. If litigation or a regulatory enforcement action on similar theories were successful against one or both of PMI and PFL, Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace could be subject to state consumer protection laws and licensing requirements in a greater number of states. 
 We rely on agreements with WebBank, pursuant to which WebBank originates loans to qualified borrowers on a uniform basis throughout the United States and sells and assigns those loans to PFL. If our relationship with WebBank were to end, we may need to rely on individual state lending licenses to originate Borrower Loans. 
 PMI's administration of Quick Invest under its previous offering and PFL s administration of Quick Invest, Recurring Investment, and Auto Invest under its current offering, could create additional liability for PFL and such liability could be material.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating our business. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. While we believe the risks and uncertainties described below include all material risks currently known by us, it is possible that these may not be the only ones we face. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO PERSONAL LOAN BORROWER DEFAULT 
 The Notes are risky and speculative investments suitable only for investors of adequate financial means. 
 Investors should be aware that the Notes offered through our marketplace are risky and speculative investments. The Notes are special, limited obligations of PFL and depend entirely for payment on PFL s receipt of payments under the corresponding Borrower Loans. Notes are suitable only for investors of adequate financial means. If an investor cannot afford to lose the entire amount of such investor s investment in the Notes, the investor should not invest in the Notes. 
 Payments on the Notes depend entirely on payments PFL receives on corresponding Borrower Loans. If a borrower fails to make any payments on the corresponding Borrower Loan related to a Note, payments on such Note will be correspondingly reduced. 
 PFL will only make payments pro-rata on a series of Notes after it receives a borrower s payment on the corresponding Borrower Loan, net of servicing fees. PFL also will retain from the funds received from the relevant borrower and otherwise available for payment on the Notes any non-sufficient funds fees and the amounts of any attorneys fees or collection fees our in-house collections department, a third-party servicer or collection agency imposes in connection with collection efforts. Under the terms of the Notes, if PFL does not receive any or all payments on the corresponding Borrower Loan, payments on the Note will be correspondingly reduced in whole or in part. If the relevant borrower does not make a payment on a specific monthly loan payment date, no payment will be made on the Note on the corresponding succeeding Note payment date. 
 The Borrower Loans are not secured by any collateral or guaranteed or insured by any third party, and investors must rely on us or a third-party collection agency to pursue collection against any borrower. 
 Borrower Loans are unsecured obligations of borrowers. They are not secured by any collateral, and they are not guaranteed or insured by PFL, PMI or any third party, or backed by any governmental authority in any way. We and our third-party collection agencies will, therefore, be limited in our ability to collect on Borrower Loans. Moreover, Borrower Loans are obligations of borrowers to PFL as successor to WebBank, not obligations to the holders of Notes. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse to the borrowers and no ability to pursue borrowers to collect payments under Borrower Loans. Holders of the Notes may look only to PFL for payment of the Notes. Furthermore, if a borrower fails to make any payments on the Borrower Loan, the holders of the Notes corresponding to that Borrower Loan will not receive any payments on their Notes. The holders of such Notes will not be able to pursue collection against the borrower and will not be able to obtain the identity of the borrower in order to contact the borrower about the defaulted Borrower Loan. 
 20 

The credit information of an applicant may be inaccurate or may not accurately reflect the applicant s creditworthiness, which may cause an investor to lose all or part of the price paid for a Note. 
 We obtain applicant credit information from consumer reporting agencies, and assign Prosper Ratings to listings based in part on the applicant s credit score. A credit score that forms a part of the Prosper Rating assigned to a listing may not reflect the applicant s actual creditworthiness because the credit score may be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate consumer reporting data. Similarly, the credit data taken from the applicant s credit report and displayed in listings may also be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate consumer reporting data. We do not verify the information obtained from the applicant s credit report. Moreover, investors do not, and will not, have access to financial statements of applicants or to other detailed financial information about applicants. 
 The Prosper Rating may not accurately set forth the risks of investing in the Notes, no assurances can be provided that actual loss rates for the Notes will come within the estimated average annualized loss rates indicated by the Prosper Rating, and investors have limited rights to cause Prosper to repurchase the Notes. 
 The Prosper Rating assigned to a loan listing may not accurately reflect the risks of investing in the Notes, and is not a recommendation by us to buy or hold a Note. For example, the Prosper Rating for a listing could be inaccurate because the applicant s credit report contained incorrect information. Similarly, although some of the information provided by applicants that is relevant to the Prosper Rating is verified by us before calculating the Prosper Rating, we do not verify all such information. For example, we do not verify the income or employment information on all applications. Further, the Prosper Rating does not reflect PFL s credit risk as a debtor (such credit risk exists even though, as the debtor on the Notes, PFL s only obligation is to pay to the Note holders their pro-rata shares of collections received on the related Borrower Loans net of applicable fees). In addition, no assurances can be provided that actual loss rates for the Notes will fall within the expected loss rates indicated by the Prosper Rating. The interest rates on the Notes might not adequately compensate Note investors for these additional risks. 
 If we include in a listing a Prosper Rating that is different from the Prosper Rating calculated by us or calculate the Prosper Rating for a listing incorrectly, and such error materially and adversely affects a holder s interest in the related Note, PFL will indemnify the holder or repurchase the Note. PFL will not, however, have any indemnity or repurchase obligation under the Amended and Restated Indenture, the Notes, the Investor Registration Agreement or any other agreement associated with the Note Channel as a result of any other inaccuracy with respect to a listing s Prosper Score or Prosper Rating. PFL s contractual repurchase obligations do not affect a Note holder s rights under federal or state securities laws. 
 Investors who use the Recurring Investment or Auto Invest tools may face additional risk of funding Borrower Loans that have been erroneously selected by the tool. 
 Since it was first implemented in July 2011 th rough December 31, 2023, the Recurring Investment (formerly known as Auto Quick Invest) tool has experienced programming errors that affected 8,630 Notes and PMI Notes out of the 13,491,750 Notes and PMI Notes purchased. The Auto Invest tool was first implemented on June 2, 2016. Since such time through December 31, 2023, the Auto Invest tool has experienced programming errors that affected 2 Notes out of the 18,528,380 Note s purchased. 
 In the event of any errors in Recurring Investment or Auto Invest that cause an investor to purchase a Note from PFL that such investor would not otherwise have purchased or that differs materially from the Note such investor would have purchased had there been no error, PFL will either repurchase the Note, indemnify the investor against losses suffered on that Note or cure such error. See Risk Factors Risks Related to PFL and PMI, Our Marketplace and Our Ability to Service the Notes for more information. 
 Some borrowers may use our marketplace to defraud investors, which could adversely affect investors ability to recoup their investment. 
 We use identity and fraud checks with external databases to authenticate each borrower s identity. There is a risk, however, that these checks could fail and fraud may occur. In addition, applicants may misrepresent their intentions regarding loan purpose or other information contained in listings, and we do not verify the majority of this information. While PFL will indemnify an investor or repurchase Notes in limited circumstances (including, e.g., a material payment default on the Borrower Loan resulting from verifiable identity theft), it is not obligated to indemnify an investor or repurchase a Note from an investor if the investment is not realized in whole or in part due to fraud (other than verifiable identity theft) in connection with a loan listing, or due to false or inaccurate statements or omissions of fact in a listing, whether in credit data, a borrower s representations, similar indicators of borrower intent and ability to repay the Borrower Loan. If PFL repurchases a Note, the repurchase price will be equal to the Note's outstanding principal balance and will not include accrued interest. If PFL repurchases any Notes, PMI will concurrently repurchase the related PMI Management Rights for zero consideration. 
 21 

The fact that we have the exclusive right and ability to investigate claims of identity theft in the origination of Borrower Loans creates a significant conflict of interest between us and our investors. 
 We have the exclusive right to investigate claims of identity theft and determine, in our sole discretion, whether verifiable identity theft has occurred. Such a determination of verifiable identity theft may trigger an obligation by PFL to either repurchase the related Notes or Borrower Loans or indemnify the applicable Note holders. The denial of a claim under PFL s identity theft guarantee would save PFL from its indemnification or repurchase obligation. Because investors rely solely on us to investigate incidents that might require PFL to indemnify the applicable Note holders or repurchase the related Notes or Borrower Loans, a conflict of interest exists between us and such investors. 
 If payments on the Borrower Loan corresponding to an investor s Note become overdue, such investor may not receive the full principal and interest payments that were expected on the Note, and such investor may not recover the original purchase price on the Note. 
 We may refer Borrower Loans that become past due to a third party collection agency for collection or we may collect on such Borrower Loans directly. If a borrower fails to make a required payment on a Borrower Loan, we will pursue reasonable collection efforts in respect of the Borrower Loan. Referral of a delinquent Borrower Loan to a collection agency within five business days after it becomes 30 days past due will be considered reasonable collection efforts. If payment amounts on a delinquent Borrower Loan are received from a borrower after the loan has been referred to our in-house collections department or an outside collection agency, we or that collection agency may retain a percentage of that payment as a fee before any principal or interest becomes payable to an investor. Collection fees may be up to 40 of recovered amounts, in addition to any legal fees and transaction fees associated with accepting payments incurred in the collection effort. 
 For some non-performing Borrower Loans, we may not be able to recover any of the unpaid loan balance and, as a result, an investor who has purchased a corresponding Note may receive little, if any, of the unpaid principal and interest payable under the Note. In all cases, investors must rely on our collection efforts or the applicable collection agency to which such Borrower Loans are referred, and are not permitted to collect or attempt collection of payments on the Borrower Loans in any manner. 
 Loss rates on the Borrower Loans may increase as a result of economic conditions beyond our control and beyond the control of the borrower. 
 Borrower Loan loss rates may be significantly affected by economic downturns or general economic conditions beyond our control and beyond the control of individual borrowers. In particular, loss rates on Borrower Loans may increase due to factors such as prevailing interest rates, the rate of unemployment, the level of consumer confidence, residential real estate values, the value of the U.S. dollar, energy prices, changes in consumer spending, the number of personal bankruptcies, disruptions in the credit markets, natural disasters, pandemics, and other factors. 
 The Borrower Loans do not restrict borrowers from incurring additional unsecured or secured debt, nor do they impose any financial restrictions on borrowers during the term of the Borrower Loan, which may reduce the likelihood that an investor will receive the full principal and interest payments that such investor expects to receive on a Note. 
 If a borrower incurs additional debt after the date a loan listing is posted, the additional debt may impair the ability of that borrower to make payments on their Borrower Loan and, as such, reduce the likelihood that an investor will receive the principal and interest payments that such investor expects to receive on a corresponding Note. Moreover, the additional debt may adversely affect the borrower s creditworthiness generally, and could result in the financial distress, insolvency, or bankruptcy of the borrower. To the extent that the borrower has or incurs other indebtedness and cannot pay all of their indebtedness, the borrower may choose to make payments to other creditors, rather than to PFL. 
 To the extent borrowers incur other indebtedness that is secured, such as a mortgage, a home equity line or an auto loan, the ability of the secured creditors to exercise remedies against the assets of the borrower may impair the borrower s ability to repay the Borrower Loan on which an investor s Note is dependent for payment. Borrowers may also choose to repay obligations under secured indebtedness or other unsecured indebtedness before repaying Borrower Loans because there is no collateral securing the Borrower Loans. An investor will not be notified if a borrower incurs additional debt after the date a loan listing is posted. 
 Borrowers may not view or treat their obligations to PFL as having the same significance as loans from traditional lending sources. 
 The investment return on the Notes depends on borrowers fulfilling their payment obligations in a timely and complete manner under the corresponding Borrower Loan. Borrowers may not view marketplace lending obligations originated through our marketplace as having the same significance as other credit obligations arising under more traditional circumstances. If a borrower neglects their payment obligations on a Borrower Loan upon which payment of an investor s Note is dependent or 
 22 

chooses not to repay their Borrower Loan entirely, such investor may not be able to recover any portion of the investment in a Note. 
 Our marketplace may fail to comply with applicable laws, which could limit our ability to collect on Borrower Loans. 
 The Borrower Loans are subject to federal and state consumer protection, licensing, and privacy laws. Our marketplace may not always be, and may not always have been, in compliance with these laws. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our marketplace may, among other things, limit our or a collection agency's ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on Borrower Loans. 
 We regularly review the requirements of these laws and take measures aimed at ensuring that the Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace meet the requirements of all applicable laws. However, determining compliance with all applicable laws is a complex matter and it is possible that our determination may be inaccurate or incorrect. Also, changes in law, either due to court decisions, regulatory interpretations or rulings, or new legislation, may adversely affect the collectability of a Borrower Loan. 
 In general, the Borrower Loans do not contain any cross-default or similar provisions. If a borrower defaults on any of their other debt obligations, our ability to collect on the Borrower Loan on which an investor s Note is dependent for payment may be substantially impaired. 
 The Borrower Loans do not contain cross-default provisions. A cross-default provision makes a default under certain debt of a borrower an automatic default on other debt of that borrower. Because the Borrower Loans do not contain cross-default provisions, a Borrower Loan will not be placed automatically in default upon that borrower s default on any of the borrower s other debt obligations. If a borrower defaults on debt obligations owed to a third party and continues to satisfy the payment obligations under the Borrower Loan, the third party may seize the borrower s assets or pursue other legal action against the borrower before the borrower defaults on the Borrower Loan, which may affect our ability to collect from the borrower when or if the Borrower Loan becomes delinquent. 
 Borrowers may seek the protection of debtor relief under federal bankruptcy or state insolvency laws, which may result in the nonpayment of an investor s Notes. 
 Borrowers may seek protection under federal bankruptcy law or similar laws. If a borrower files for bankruptcy (or becomes the subject of an involuntary petition), a stay will go into effect that will automatically put any pending collection actions on the Borrower Loan on hold and prevent further collection action absent bankruptcy court approval. If we receive notice that a borrower has filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, or has become the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition, we will put the borrower s account into bankruptcy status. When this occurs, we terminate automatic monthly ACH debits on the Borrower Loan and we will not undertake collection activity without bankruptcy court approval. Whether any payment will ultimately be made or received on a Borrower Loan after a bankruptcy status is declared depends on the borrower s particular financial situation. In most cases, however, unsecured creditors such as PFL receive nothing, or only a fraction of their outstanding debt and, as a result, an investor who has purchased a corresponding Note may receive none or very little of the unpaid principal and interest payable on the Note. 
 Federal law entitles borrowers who enter active military service to an interest rate cap and certain other rights that may inhibit the ability to collect on Borrower Loans and reduce the amount of interest paid on the corresponding Notes. 
 Federal law provides borrowers on active military service with rights that may delay or impair our ability to collect on a Borrower Loan corresponding to an investor s Note. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act SCRA and other similar state laws require that the interest rate on preexisting debts, such as Borrower Loans, be set at no more than 6 while the qualified service member or reservist is on active duty. A holder of a Note that is dependent on such a Borrower Loan for payment will not receive the difference between 6 and the original stated interest rate for the Borrower Loan during any such period. The SCRA also permits courts to stay proceedings and the execution of judgments against service members and reservists on active duty, which may delay recovery on any Borrower Loans in default, and, accordingly, payments on the corresponding Notes. 
 Beginning October 3, 2016, the Military Lending Act MLA prohibits requiring covered borrowers, which include active military servicemembers and their dependents, to waive the right to legal recourse or to submit to arbitration. This may delay recovery on any relevant Borrower Loans in default, and, accordingly, payments on the corresponding Notes. 
 If there are any amounts under such a Borrower Loan still due and owing to PFL after the final maturity of the corresponding Notes, PFL will have no further obligation to make payments on such Notes, even if it receives payments on the Borrower Loan after the final maturity of such Notes. We do not take military service into account in assigning a Prosper Rating to loan listings. In addition, as part of the borrower registration process, we do not request borrowers to confirm if they are qualified service members or reservists within the meaning of the SCRA or the MLA. See Item 1, Business Government Regulation for more information. 
 23 

As of December 31, 2023 , 162 Borrower Loans, with a total outstanding balance of 1.3 million are subject to the SCRA. 
 The Federal Trade Commission's Holder in Due Course Rule may substantially impair an investor s ability to recoup the full purchase price of a Note or to receive the interest payments that such investor expects to receive on the Note. 
 The Federal Trade Commission's Holder in Due Course Rule, which in certain circumstances permits borrowers to assert any claims and defenses that they would have had against a seller of goods or services obtained with the proceeds of a loan against an originator or subsequent purchaser of the loan, could allow certain borrowers to raise such defenses against PFL to the extent of the outstanding loan balance. If such defenses are successfully raised, PFL will be unable to collect on the loan and it is unlikely that any further payment will be made on the corresponding Notes. 
 The death of a borrower may substantially impair an investor s ability to recoup the full purchase price of a Note or to receive the interest payments that such investor expects to receive on the Note. 
 If a borrower dies with an outstanding Borrower Loan, PFL is required, upon receiving notice of the death, to stop accepting automatic loan payments and to refund any payments that were automatically debited after the borrower's date of death. Though we may seek to work with the executor of the borrower s estate to obtain repayment of the loan, the borrower s estate may not contain sufficient assets to repay the loan, or its executor may prioritize repayment of other creditors. In addition, if a borrower dies near the end of the term of their Borrower Loan, the time required for the probate of the borrower s estate will likely extend beyond the Notes final maturity date, after which date PFL will cease to have any obligation to make payments on the Notes. 
 
 RISKS INHERENT IN INVESTING IN THE NOTES 
 The Notes are special, limited obligations of PFL only and are not directly secured by any collateral or guaranteed or insured by PMI or any third party. 
 The Notes will not represent an obligation of borrowers, PMI or any other party except PFL, and are special, limited obligations of PFL. The Notes are not guaranteed or insured by PMI, any governmental agency or instrumentality, or any third party. Although PFL has granted the indenture trustee, for the benefit of the Note holders, a security interest in the Borrower Loans corresponding to the Notes, the payments and proceeds that PFL receives on such Borrower Loans, the bank account in which such Borrower Loan payments are deposited, and the accounts in which investors funding amounts are deposited, the Note holders do not themselves have a direct security interest in the Borrower Loans or the right to payment thereunder. If an event of default under the Amended and Restated Indenture were to occur, the Note holders would be dependent on the indenture trustee s ability to realize on the collateral and make payments on the Notes in the manner contemplated by the Amended and Restated Indenture. In addition, although PFL will take all actions that it believes are required under applicable law to perfect the security interest of the indenture trustee in the collateral, if its analysis of the required actions is incorrect or if it fails to take any required action in a timely manner, the indenture trustee s security interest may not be effective and holders of the Notes could be required to share the collateral (and any proceeds thereof) with PFL s other creditors, or, if a bankruptcy court were to order the substantive consolidation of PMI and PFL (as described below), PMI s creditors. 
 PFL is not obligated to indemnify Note holders or repurchase Notes except in limited circumstances. 
 PFL is only obligated to repurchase Notes or indemnify holders of Notes in limited circumstances. These circumstances include if (i) a material payment default under the corresponding Borrower Loan occurs as a result of verifiable identify theft; (ii) we include a Prosper Rating in a listing that is different from the Prosper Rating we calculated, or we calculate the Prosper Rating incorrectly; or (iii) any errors in Quick Invest, Recurring Investment, or Auto Invest cause an investor to purchase a Note from PFL that such investor would not otherwise have purchased or that differs materially from the Note, in which cases PFL also has the option to cure such error. PFL is not required to repurchase Notes or indemnify holders of Notes, however, if the Note holder s investment is not realized in whole or in part due to fraud other than verified identity theft, or due to other false or inaccurate statements or omissions of fact in a listing, whether in credit data, borrower representations or similar indicia of borrower intent and ability to repay the loan. Further, PFL is under no obligation to repurchase a Note or indemnify any holder of Notes if a correctly determined Prosper Rating fails to accurately predict the actual losses on a Borrower Loan. 
 PFL might incur indemnification and repurchase obligations that exceed its projections, in which case it may not have sufficient liquidity to meet its indemnification and repurchase obligations. 
 PFL believes its liquidity will be sufficient to meet its reasonably anticipated indemnification and repurchase obligations. In determining its expected liquidity needs with respect to indemnification and repurchase obligations, PFL considers the history of such obligations incurred by it and PMI. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that if PFL is obligated to repurchase a Note or indemnify a Note holder, that it will be able to meet its repurchase or indemnification obligations. If PFL is unable to meet its indemnification and repurchase obligations with respect to a Note, the investor in such Note may lose 
 24 

all of such investor s investment in the Note. For more information about Prosper s existing repurchase and indemnification obligations, please see Repurchase Obligations in Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 Our marketplace allows a borrower to prepay a Borrower Loan at any time without penalty. Borrower Loan prepayments will extinguish or limit an investor s ability to receive additional interest payments on a Note. 
 Borrower Loan prepayment occurs when a borrower decides to pay some or all of the principal amount on a Borrower Loan earlier than originally scheduled. Borrowers may decide to prepay all or a portion of the remaining principal amount due under a Borrower Loan at any time without penalty. In the event of a prepayment of the entire remaining unpaid principal amount of a Borrower Loan, each of the holders of the Notes corresponding to the Borrower Loan will receive their share of such prepayment but further interest will not accrue on such Borrower Loan or on such Note after the date on which the payment is made. If the borrower prepays a portion of the remaining unpaid principal balance, the term of the Borrower Loan will not change, but interest will cease to accrue on the prepaid portion. If a borrower prepays a Borrower Loan in whole or in part, an investor will not receive all of the interest payments that such investor originally expected to receive on the Note corresponding to such Borrower Loan. In addition, such investor may not be able to find a similar rate of return on another investment at the time at which the Borrower Loan is prepaid. Prepayments are subject to PFL s servicing fee, even if the prepayment occurs immediately after issuance of a Note. 
 Prevailing interest rates may change during the term of the Notes. If this occurs, investors may receive less value from the purchase of Notes in comparison to other ways they may invest their money. Additionally, borrowers may prepay their Borrower Loans due to changes in interest rates, and investors may not be able to redeploy the amounts received from prepayments in a way that offers the return expected from the Notes. 
 The Borrower Loans on which the Notes are dependent for payment bear fixed, not floating, rates of interest. If prevailing interest rates increase, the interest rates on Notes investors purchase might be less than the rate of return they could earn if they had invested the purchase price in a different investment. 
 We may not set appropriate interest rates for Borrower Loans. 
 We set interest rates for all Borrower Loans based on Prosper Ratings, as well as additional factors such as Borrower Loan terms, the economic environment and competitive conditions. If we set interest rates for Borrower Loans too low, investors may not be compensated appropriately for the level of risk that they are assuming in purchasing Notes, while setting the interest rate too high may increase the risk of non-payment. In either case, a failure by us to set rates appropriately may adversely impact the ability of investors to receive returns on their Notes that are commensurate with the risks they have assumed in acquiring such Notes. 
 The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and can be held only by registered Prosper investors. Further, no trading platform for the transfer of Notes exists and there can be no assurance a trading platform for the transfer of Notes will develop in the future. Therefore, investors should be prepared to hold the Notes they purchase until maturity. 
 The Notes and PMI Management Rights will not be listed on any securities exchange and all Notes and PMI Management Rights must be held by registered Prosper investors. Further, in connection with the termination of our relationship with FOLIO Investments, Inc. in October 2016, a trading platform for the transfer of Notes and PMI Management Rights no longer exists. While we may, in our sole discretion, permit the establishment of another platform on which a secondary market may be made with respect to the Notes, there can be no assurance a trading platform for the Notes and PMI Management Rights will develop in the future. Therefore, Note purchasers must be prepared to hold their Notes and PMI Management Rights to maturity. 
 The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes are uncertain. 
 There are no statutory provisions, regulations, published rulings or judicial decisions that directly address the characterization of the Notes or instruments similar to the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, although the matter is not free from doubt because payments on the Notes are dependent on payments on the corresponding Borrower Loan, PFL treats the Notes as debt instruments that have original issue discount OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Where required, PFL intends to file informational returns with the IRS in accordance with such treatment unless there is a change or clarification in the law, by regulation or otherwise, that would require a different characterization of the Notes. Investors should be aware, however, that the IRS is not bound by PFL s characterization of the Notes and the IRS or a court may take a different position with respect to the Notes proper characterization. For example, the IRS could determine that, in substance, each investor owns a proportionate interest in the corresponding Borrower Loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes or, for example, the IRS could instead treat the Notes as a different financial instrument (including an equity interest or a derivative financial instrument). Any different characterization could significantly affect the amount, timing, and character of income, gain or loss recognized in respect of a Note. For example, if the Notes are treated as PFL s equity, (i) PFL would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income, including interest, accrued on the corresponding Borrower Loans but would not be entitled to deduct interest or OID on the Notes, and (ii) payments on the Notes would be treated by the Note holder for U.S. federal 
 25 

income tax purposes as dividends (that may be ineligible for reduced rates of U.S. federal income taxation or the dividends-received deduction) to the extent of PFL s earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A different characterization may significantly reduce the amount available to pay interest on the Notes. Investors are strongly advised to consult their own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Notes (including any possible differing treatments of the Notes). 
 PFL s ability to pay principal and interest on a Note may be affected by its ability to match the timing of its income and deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Investors should be aware that PFL s ability to pay principal and interest on a Note may be affected by its ability, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to match the timing of income it receives from a corresponding Borrower Loan that it holds and the timing of deductions that it may be entitled to in respect of payments made on the Notes that it issues. For example, if the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes but the corresponding Borrower Loans are not, there could be a potential mismatch in the timing of PFL s income and deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and PFL s resulting tax liabilities could affect its ability to make payments on the Notes. 
 Our participation in the funding of Borrower Loans could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest. 
 As is the practice with other marketplace lending companies, from time to time, we may fund portions of qualified loan requests in our marketplace and hold any Notes purchased as a result of such funding for our own individual accounts. Even though we will participate in funding Borrower Loans listed in our marketplace under the same terms and conditions and through the use of the same information that is made available to other potential investors in our marketplace, such participation may be perceived as involving a conflict of interest. For example, our funding of a Borrower Loan may cause the loan to fund, and in some cases, fund faster, than it would fund in the absence of our participation, which could benefit us to the extent that it ensures that we generate the revenue associated with the loan. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023 , we purchased 0.3 million in Notes for investment. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO PFL AND PMI, OUR MARKETPLACE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE THE NOTES 
 Human error in the operation of our platform has resulted in the allocation of Borrower Loans to our Note Channel which did not conform to the eligibility criteria applicable to Borrower Loans at the time of allocation. If we are unable to prevent the reoccurrence of similar errors, our business and investors could be adversely impacted. 
 In August 2022, we became aware of an error which resulted in the allocation of certain Borrower Loans intended for our Whole Loan Channel to our Note Channel. These Borrower Loans corresponded to Borrower Loan listings with attributes which, at the time of allocation, did not conform to the eligibility criteria applicable to Borrower Loans offered for investment in our Note Channel. The error impacted a total of approximately 14 million out of the approximately 182 million of Borrower Loans allocated to the Note Channel from January 2022 to August 2022. The error did not affect any other parts of Note investors accounts or the platform, including the receipt and distribution of loan payments, the Note and loan level information provided to investors, or the enforceability of the Borrower Loans. Following discovery of the error, we repurchased the impacted Notes from investors for the full outstanding principal balance, allowing such investors to retain all interest, principal and other payments received on such Notes prior to their repurchase, and have implemented new measures designed to avoid similar issues in the future. 
 
 This error illustrates the risks of human error on our processes to allocate loan listings to the Note Channel. If similar errors were to occur in the future, it could result in repurchase or indemnification obligations, negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, harm to our reputation, litigation, regulatory inquiries or proceedings, loss of or damage to our relationships with borrowers or investors, loss of income and/or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 
 We have experienced errors on our platform that have resulted in incorrect reporting of performance returns to Note investors. If we are unable to prevent the reoccurrence of similar errors, investors could be adversely impacted. 
 In April 2017, we became aware of an error in the annualized net return and seasoned annualized net return numbers displayed to Note investors, which resulted from errors in the code forming part of our calculation framework. On average, the error resulted in Note investors being shown annualized net return information that was approximately 260 basis points higher than the actual performance of Notes in their accounts. The error did not affect any other part of Note investors accounts, nor did it affect any other aspects of the platform, including the receipt and distribution of loan payments, deposits, monthly statements or tax documentation, or the Note and loan level information provided to investors. Following an SEC investigation, we entered into a settlement with the SEC to resolve the matter on April 19, 2019. Under the settlement, the SEC alleged a negligence-based violation of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and ordered PFL to cease and desist from any future 
 26 

violations of that provision. PFL neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of 3.0 million. PFL paid the penalty in full on April 24, 2019. 
 The error reveals a risk associated with the complex programs, algorithms and inputs that support our platform. We depend on these programs, algorithms and inputs to store, retrieve, process and manage data, as well as to provide marketplace features such as our credit assessments and underwriting, the Prosper Rating, historical returns, and individual Note, Note portfolio and platform-wide performance data. Errors or other design defects within these programs, algorithms and inputs may result in a negative experience for borrowers and investors, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, or impact the information displayed on our website. They could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, harm to our reputation, litigation, regulatory inquiries or proceedings, loss of or damage to our relationships with borrowers or investors, or loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 Arrangements for back-up servicing are limited. If PMI fails to maintain operations or the Administration Agreement is rejected or terminated (in bankruptcy or otherwise), investors may experience a delay and increased cost in respect of their expected principal and interest payments on Notes, and PFL may be unable to collect and process repayments from borrowers. 
 If the Administration Agreement (or the loan servicing provisions thereof) are terminated for any reason (whether as a result of PMI s bankruptcy, non-performance or otherwise), PFL would attempt to transfer the loan servicing obligations on the Borrower Loans and Notes to a third party pursuant to its contractual agreements with investors. 
 PFL has entered into a back-up servicing agreement with a loan servicing company that is willing and able to transition servicing responsibilities from PMI. There can be no assurance, however, that this back-up servicer will be able to adequately perform the servicing of the outstanding Borrower Loans and Notes. If this back-up servicer assumes the servicing of the Borrower Loans and Notes, the back-up servicer may impose additional servicing fees (up to the maximums we have negotiated), reducing the amounts available for payments on the Notes. Additionally, transferring these servicing obligations to the back-up servicer may result in delays in the processing of collections on Borrower Loans and information with respect to amounts owed on Borrower Loans. If the back-up servicer is not able to service the Borrower Loans and Notes effectively, investors ability to receive principal and interest payments on their Notes may be substantially impaired, even if their portfolio of Notes is well diversified and the corresponding Borrower Loans are paying on schedule. 
 In addition, it is unlikely that the back-up servicer would be able to perform functions other than servicing the outstanding Borrower Loans and Notes, such as facilitating the creation of new Borrower Loans through our marketplace, or managing PFL s marketing efforts. PFL believes that it could find one or more other parties who could perform these and any other functions necessary to fully operate our marketplace in the absence of PMI. However, this process, and any related onboarding of such party or parties, will take time. Any such delay or impairment that does not affect existing Note holders, because PFL or its back-up servicer proves able to continue servicing outstanding Borrower Loans and Notes, could nonetheless delay PFL s ability to facilitate the origination of new Borrower Loans and issue new Notes through our marketplace, which could adversely affect PFL s finances and customer relationships. 
 A decline in economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
 As a lending marketplace, we believe our customers are highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers ability or desire to participate in our marketplace as borrowers or investors, and consequently could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 A relatively small number of investors provide the funding for a large percentage of all Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace. 
 A relatively small number of investors provide the funding for a large percentage of all Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace. If these investors cease or significantly decrease their investment in Borrower Loans through our personal loan marketplace and PFL is unable to attract sufficient investor purchase commitments from new and existing investors, then our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Our business could be adversely affected by a weakening market for securities backed by consumer assets. 
 PFL is involved in the securitization market through: (i) its business of selling loans to investors who, in turn, sell asset backed securities based on accumulated loan portfolios and (ii) securitization of loans retained by affiliates of PFL. If the market for asset backed securities based on consumer assets weakens, investors may cease or significantly decrease their funding of Borrower Loans through our marketplace and if PFL has been unable to attract sufficient investor purchase commitments from new and existing investors, then our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 27 

Although PFL has been organized in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that it will become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, if this were to occur, the rights of holders of the Notes could be uncertain, and payments on the Notes may be limited, suspended or stopped. The recovery, if any, of a holder on a Note may therefore be substantially delayed and substantially less than the principal and interest due and to become due on the Note. 
 Although PFL has been organized and is operated in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that it will become subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, if this were to occur, the recovery, if any, of a holder of a Note may be substantially delayed in time (for example, due to the imposition of a stay on payments by the bankruptcy court) and may be substantially less in amount than the principal and interest due and to become due on the Note even if a Note holder s portfolio of Notes is well diversified and the Borrower Loans are paying on schedule. Further, although PFL has granted the indenture trustee, for the benefit of the Note holders, a security interest in all of the Borrower Loans, in all payments and proceeds it receives on the corresponding Borrower Loans and in the bank account in which the Borrower Loan payments are deposited, the holders of the Notes would still be subject to risks associated with PFL s insolvency, bankruptcy or a similar proceeding. 
 If PFL becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, borrowers may delay payments or cease making payments at all . 
 Borrowers may delay or suspend making payments to PFL because of the uncertainties associated with PFL becoming subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, even if the borrowers have no legal right to do so, and such delay would reduce, at least for a time, the funds that might otherwise be available to pay the Notes corresponding to those Borrower Loans. In addition, the commencement of the bankruptcy or similar proceeding may, as a matter of law, prevent PFL from making regular payments on the Notes, even if the funds to make such payments are available. Because the Indenture trustee would be required to enforce its security interest in the Borrower Loans in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Indenture trustee's ability to make payments under the Notes would be delayed, which may effectively reduce the value of any recovery that a holder of a Note may receive (and no such recovery can be assured) by the time any recovery is available. 
 If PFL becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, interest accruing on the Notes upon and following such bankruptcy or similar proceeding may not be paid . 
 In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of PFL, interest accruing on the Notes during the proceeding may not be part of the allowed claim of a holder of a Note. If the Note holder receives a recovery on the Note (and no such recovery can be assured), any such recovery may be based on, and limited to, the Note holder s claim for principal and for interest accrued up to the date of the bankruptcy or similar proceeding, but not thereafter. Because a bankruptcy or similar proceeding may take months or years to complete, a claim based on principal and on interest only up to the start of the bankruptcy or similar proceeding may be substantially less than a claim based on principal and on interest through the end of the bankruptcy or similar proceeding. 
 If PFL becomes subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, a Note holder may not have any priority right to payment from the corresponding Borrower Loan, may not have any right to payment from funds in the applicable servicing account, and may not have any ability to access funds in the applicable funding accounts (the FBO Funding accounts ). 
 In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, if PFL has failed to perfect the security interest in Borrower Loans, investors may be required to share the proceeds of the Borrower Loans upon which their Notes are dependent for payment with PFL s other creditors, including holders of other Notes or Borrower Loans. To the extent that proceeds of the Borrower Loans would be shared with PFL s other creditors, any secured or priority rights of such other creditors may cause the proceeds to be distributed to such other creditors before any distribution is made to investors on the corresponding Notes. 
 If a payment is made on a Borrower Loan corresponding to a Note before PFL s bankruptcy or similar proceeding is commenced, and those funds are held in the servicing account PFL maintains with Wells Fargo to collect borrower payments and have not been used by PFL to make payments on the Note as of the date the bankruptcy or similar proceeding is commenced, there can be no assurance that PFL will or will be able to use such funds to make payments on such Note. Other creditors of PFL (including holders of other Notes or Borrower Loans) may be deemed to have rights to such funds or interests in the applicable servicing account and monies credited thereto that are equal to or greater than the rights of the holder of such Note. 
 Although PFL believes that amounts funded by both Whole Loan Channel and Note Channel investors into the applicable FBO Funding accounts should not be subject to claims of its creditors other than the investors for whose benefit the funds are held, the legal title to the FBO Funding accounts, and the attendant right to administer the FBO Funding accounts, would be property of PFL s bankruptcy estate. As a result, if PFL were to file for bankruptcy protection, the legal right to administer the funds in the FBO Funding accounts would vest with the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession. In that case, while neither PFL nor its creditors should be able to reach those funds, the indenture trustee or the investors may have to seek a bankruptcy court order lifting the automatic stay and permitting them to withdraw their funds. Investors may suffer delays in accessing their funds in the FBO Funding accounts as a result. Moreover, United States bankruptcy courts have broad powers at 
 28 

law and in equity and, if PFL has failed to properly segregate or handle investors funds, a bankruptcy court could determine that some or all of such funds were beneficially owned by PFL and should therefore be made available to PFL s creditors generally. 
 In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of PFL, a holder of a Note may be delayed or prevented from enforcing PFL s repurchase obligations with respect to such Note. 
 In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of PFL, any right of a Note holder to require PFL to repurchase the Note or indemnify such Note holder under the circumstances set forth in the Investor Registration Agreement or the Note might not be enforceable, and such holder s claim for such repurchase may be treated less favorably than a general unsecured obligation of PFL. 
 Although PFL has been organized in a manner that is intended to prevent it from being substantively consolidated with PMI in the event of PMI s bankruptcy, if PFL were substantively consolidated in this manner, the rights of the holders of the Notes could be uncertain, and payments on the Notes may be limited, suspended or stopped. The recovery, if any, of a holder on a Note may therefore be substantially delayed and substantially less than the principal and interest due and to become due on the Note. 
 Although PFL has been organized and is operated in a manner that is intended to prevent it from being substantively consolidated with PMI in the event of PMI s bankruptcy, if PMI became subject to a bankruptcy or similar proceeding and PFL were substantively consolidated with PMI, the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factors regarding (i) payment delays, (ii) uncollectability of interest accrued during the bankruptcy proceeding, (iii) being subordinated to the interests of PFL s other creditors, and (iv) the indenture trustee s inability to access funds in the deposit account or the FBO Funding accounts, would all be present and, in addition, the same considerations would apply in relation to the claims of creditors of PMI, including that such creditors of PMI may be determined to have perfected security interests or unsecured claims that take precedence over or are at least equal in priority to those of creditors of PFL (including holders of Notes). 
 In addition, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding of PMI, (i) the implementation of back-up servicing arrangements may be delayed or prevented, and (ii) PMI s ability to transfer its servicing obligations to a back-up servicer or its other corporate and marketplace administration services and marketing services to third parties may be limited and subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court or other presiding authority. The bankruptcy process may delay or prevent the implementation of back-up servicing, which may impair the collection on Borrower Loans to the detriment of Note holders. 
 PMI owns and did not transfer to PFL ownership of the computer hardware that it uses to host and maintain the website or agreements with third parties relating to the hosting and maintenance of the website. Although PMI s retention of such hardware and agreements should not bear on a bankruptcy court s analysis of the legal separateness of PMI and PFL (or their respective assets and liabilities), the cessation of or substantial reduction of the day-to-day operations of PMI (because of or during its bankruptcy or otherwise) would materially impair and delay the ability of PFL or a back-up service provider to retrieve data and information in the possession of PMI and to operate our marketplace or elements thereof relevant to Borrower Loan and Note servicing. 
 PMI, in its capacity as servicer, has the authority to waive or modify the terms of a Borrower Loan without the consent of the Note holders. 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, PMI is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to service and collect on the Borrower Loans in accordance with industry standards. Subject to that obligation, the Administration Agreement grants PMI the authority to waive or modify any non-material term of a Borrower Loan, consent to the postponement of strict compliance with any such term, or in any manner grant a non-material indulgence to any borrower. In addition, if a Borrower Loan is in default, or PMI determines a default is reasonably foreseeable or that such action is consistent with its servicing obligation, the Administration Agreement grants PMI the authority to waive or modify a material term of a Borrower Loan, to accept payment of an amount less than the principal balance in final satisfaction of a Borrower Loan and to grant any indulgence to a borrower, provided that PMI has reasonably and prudently determined that such action will not be materially adverse to the interests of the relevant Note holders. If PMI approves a modification to the terms of any Borrower Loan it must promptly notify the corresponding Note holders in each Note holder's account. 
 There can be no assurance that PMI, in its capacity as servicer, will be able to collect the principal amount or interest rate agreed to and/or sell charged off Borrower Loans in the future as a result of business, regulatory or other considerations. 
 We have incurred operating losses in prior years and may continue to incur net losses in the future. 
 We have incurred operating losses in prior years, including 2023, and may continue to incur net losses in the future. We have financed our operations to date primarily with proceeds from the sale of equity securities. In addition, we borrowed 75.0 million under the Term Loan in November 2022. PMI is dependent upon raising additional capital or debt financing to fund its current operating plan if it cannot generate sufficient positive cash flow from operations. PMI s failure to achieve 
 29 

positive cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient debt and equity financing, could adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement and, in su ch event, PFL s ability to continue to make payments on the Notes could be materially impaired. 
 The Term Loan, and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 In November 2022, we entered into the Term Loan, which provides for 75.0 million in debt financing that matures in November 2026. 
 Our ability to make payments on the Term Loan, to repay the Term Loan when due, and to fund our business, operations and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to pay with available cash or generate cash in the future. The Term Loan, and any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes to service the Term Loan . If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to service the Term Loan, we may need to refinance the Term Loan, dispose of assets, or issue additional equity to obtain the necessary funds. If required to do so, we may be unable to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all. 
 In addition, the Term Loan contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth covenant, minimum net liquidity covenant, maximum leverage ratio, and minimum asset coverage ratio, together with other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The obligations under the Term Loan are also secured by assets of PMI and certain of its subsidiaries. Compliance with these covenants may require us to divert funds intended for other uses and limit our flexibility to take certain actions . 
 See Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information about the Term Loan. 
 Although our business has grown, we may be unable to manage our growth effectively and meet the demands that such growth places on our facilities, employees and infrastructure. 
 As the number of borrowers, investors and Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace increases, PMI will need to increase its facilities, personnel and infrastructure in order to continue performing effectively its obligations under the Administration Agreement and to accommodate the effects that such growth will have on our servicing and marketplace needs. PMI must constantly add new hardware and update its software and our personal loan marketplace, expand customer support services, and add new employees to maintain the operations of our personal loan marketplace as well as to satisfy its servicing obligations on the Borrower Loans and the Notes and its other obligations under the Administration Agreement. If PMI is unable to increase the capacity of our marketplace and maintain the necessary infrastructure to perform its duties under the Administration Agreement, PFL, or one or more other third-party service providers engaged by PFL, will have to perform the duties otherwise performed by PMI, and investors may experience delays in receipt of payments on their Notes and periodic downtime of our marketplace. 
 The Credit Card and Home Equity Products are new products within a competitive market which are complex and require us to allocate significant resources to the development, launch and growth of these new products. If these new products are unable to attract borrowers and generate revenue, our business and results of operations could suffer. 
 The HELOC product was launched in March 2019, the Credit Card product was launched in December 2021, and the HELoan product was launched in October 2022. The launch of these new and complex products requires us to allocate significant resources in hiring new employees to support each product, ensuring each product complies with applicable laws and regulations, and integrating the products into our online platform. See Item 1, Business Government Regulation for more information about the laws and regulations which affect the Credit Card and Home Equity Products. Our Home Equity and Credit Card products also face intense competition from other new market entrants or business expansion from established companies which may have more experience and resources operating these products. There is no guarantee that we will attract the borrowers necessary to generate sufficient revenue to recoup the investment of resources into the development, launch, and growth of these new products. The products may also divert management s time and effort from other initiatives. 
 The Credit Card and Home Equity Products are not available on our personal loan marketplace for investment purposes. 
 Our Credit Card product has a limited performance history and, as we are responsible for verified fraud losses and most straight charegeoffs across the portfolio and for credit losses on accounts allocated to us, any failure to accurately capture credit and market risks could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Our Credit Card product was launched in December 2021 and has a limited performance history. The performance of the Credit Card product is also significantly dependent on the ability of the application process and credit risk models we use for the Credit Card product to prevent fraud, evaluate an applicant s credit profile and determine the likelihood of default. There is no assurance that our Credit Card application process and credit risk models can accurately verify Credit Card applicants and 
 30 

predict repayment and loss profiles. Pursuant to our program agreement with Coastal, we are responsible for verified fraud losses and most straight charge-offs across the entire Credit Card portfolio and for credit losses for approximately 90 of the Credit Card accounts. If our application process and risk models do not accurately prevent fraud or reflect credit risk on the Credit Card product, greater than expected losses may result and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our Credit Card product is also currently focused on higher risk borrowers, who may have higher exposure to economic downturns and general economic conditions beyond our control and beyond the control of these borrowers. The risk of exposure faced by these borrowers may be even higher amidst recent market conditions, including a rising rate of inflation and increase in interest rates. See A rising rate of inflation and increase in interest rates could materially and adversely impact our personal loan marketplace, our Credit Card program, and our investments in Borrower Loans for more information about these recent market conditions. 
 The Credit Card and Home Equity Products are not available on our personal loan marketplace for investment purposes. 
 We rely on our program agreement with Coastal to offer our Credit Card product. If our relationship with Coastal were to end, the ability to continue to offer our Credit Card product would be affected, which could affect our financial and business results. 
 
 We offer our Credit Card product to eligible consumers through a program agreement with Coastal, our bank partner for the Credit Card product. If our relationship with Coastal were to end or if Coastal were to cease operations, our ability to continue to offer our Credit Card product would be affected, which could adversely affect our financial and business results. In such an event, one or both of PMI and PFL would need to either partner with a different bank or rely on individual state lending licenses (to the extent necessary) to continue to offer the Credit Card product. Because neither of PMI or PFL currently possess all required licenses to offer the Credit Card product in every state, we might be forced to limit the rates of interest charged on the Credit Card product in some states and might not be able to offer the Credit Card in certain states altogether. If we partner with a new bank, issuance and servicing of the Credit Card product could be disrupted and delayed as we transition to a different bank partner. We also may face increased costs and compliance burdens if the program agreement with Coastal is terminated. 
 
 In addition, Prosper s allocation of Credit Card receivables are maintained on the balance sheet of Coastal and Coastal holds a cash reserve account funded by Prosper which applies to Prosper s allocation of Credit Card charge-off losses and all fraud losses. The Credit Card program agreement contains provisions that provide for the transition to a new bank partner and wind down of the agreement, but if our relationship with Coastal were to end due to unforeseen circumstances or if Coastal were to cease operations, the Credit Card receivables and the cash reserve account could be affected. 
 
 PFL s reliance on PMI or other third-party service providers, lack of employees, limited operating history, and capitalization levels could make it difficult to operate at a sustainable level. 
 PFL was formed in 2012 as a limited purpose vehicle. Under the Administration Agreement, PFL receives a license fee from PMI for granting PMI a non-exclusive, worldwide license to access and use our marketplace. In addition, PFL earns servicing fees in relation to the servicing of the Borrower Loans and Notes that it retains from collections on the Borrower Loans. PFL believes this fee income is sufficient to cover its reasonably anticipated obligations. While PFL believes that it is adequately capitalized to meet its foreseeable obligations, and that its fee income is sufficient to meet its ongoing operating costs, its financial resources are limited and could prove to be insufficient. In addition, PFL has no employees and relies on PMI, as servicer, or other third-party service providers, to perform most of its day-to-day operations. The lack of PFL s own employees, its limited operating history, and capitalization that is less than that of PMI could make it difficult for PFL to operate at a level that will be sustainable. Absent the services to be provided to PFL by PMI pursuant to the Administration Agreement, PFL's risk management process, ability to predict loss rates and the general operation of our marketplace would have a smaller margin for error than does PMI. 
 The market in which we participate is competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. 
 The consumer lending market is competitive and rapidly changing. With the introduction of new technologies and the influx of new entrants, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase volume in our marketplace. 
 Our principal competitors include banking institutions, credit unions, credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, consumer finance companies, and online lending platforms. Competition could result in reduced volumes, reduced fees or the failure of our marketplace to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. In addition, in the future we may experience new competition including companies possessing large, existing customer bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels. If any of these companies or any major financial institution decides to 
 31 

enter our online lending sector, acquire one of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one of our competitors, our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our operating results could be harmed. 
 Most of our current or potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their marketplaces and distribution channels. Our potential competitors may also have longer operating histories, more extensive customer bases, greater brand recognition and broader customer relationships than we have. These competitors may be better able to develop new products, to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. Our industry is driven by constant innovation. If we are unable to compete with such companies and meet the need for innovation, the use of our marketplace could stagnate or substantially decline. 
 If we fail to promote and maintain our brand in a cost-effective manner, we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease. 
 To succeed, we must increase transaction volumes in our marketplace by attracting a large number of borrowers and investors in a cost-effective manner. If we are not able to attract qualified borrowers and sufficient investor purchase commitments, we will not be able to increase our transaction volumes. PFL believes that developing and maintaining awareness of its brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our marketplace and attracting new borrower and investors. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our industry increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of marketing efforts, the user experience on our marketplace and our ability to maintain and defend a differentiated brand identity. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues. If we fail to successfully promote, defend, and maintain our brand, we may lose our existing users to competitors or be unable to attract new users, which would cause our revenue to decrease and may impair our ability to maintain our marketplace. 
 The proprietary technology that makes operation of our marketplace possible is not fully protected by patents. It may be difficult and costly for PFL to protect its intellectual property rights in relation thereto, or to continue to develop or obtain new technologies, which could adversely affect its ability to operate competitively. 
 On February 1, 2013, PMI transferred ownership of the marketplace, including the proprietary technology and all of the rights related to the operation of the marketplace, to PFL. PFL s ability to maintain our marketplace depends, in part, upon this proprietary technology. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary interests in such technology, including through patent filings, and intend to continue to vigorously protect these interests. Despite our best efforts, however, we may not protect the proprietary technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and adversely affect our ability to compete. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use the proprietary technology without PFL s consent. In addition, our marketplace may infringe upon claims of third-party patents and PFL or PMI may face intellectual property challenges from such other parties. PFL or PMI may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. Furthermore, the technology may become obsolete, and there is no guarantee that PFL will be able to successfully develop, obtain or use new technologies to adapt our marketplace to compete with other companies. If PFL cannot protect the proprietary technology embodied in and used by our marketplace from intellectual property challenges, or if our marketplace becomes obsolete, PFL s ability to maintain our marketplace and perform its servicing obligations could be adversely affected and, in such event, its ability to continue to make payments on the Notes could be materially impaired. 
 PFL relies on a third-party commercial bank to process transactions. If PFL is unable to continue utilizing these services, its business and ability to service the Notes may be adversely affected. 
 Because PFL is not a bank, it cannot belong to or directly access the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment network. As a result, it currently relies on an FDIC-insured depository institution to process its transactions. If PFL cannot continue to obtain such services from this institution or elsewhere, or if it cannot transition to another processor quickly, its ability to process payments will suffer and investors ability to receive principal and interest payments on the Notes will be delayed or impaired. 
 If the security of PFL's investors' and borrowers' confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, users' secure information may be stolen, our reputations may be harmed, and we may be exposed to liability. 
 As with any entity with a significant Internet presence, we and certain third party vendors occasionally have experienced cyber-attacks, breaches of our and their systems and other similar incidents, which to-date have not had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Future attacks are likely to occur. Our marketplace stores PFL s investors and borrowers bank information and other personally identifiable sensitive data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could cause users secure information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to secure information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time- 
 32 

consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee or contractor error, malfeasance, faulty password management or otherwise, or if design flaws in the relevant software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party or disaffected employee obtains unauthorized access to any investors or borrowers data, PFL s relationships with its users could be severely damaged, and PFL (or PMI) could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and PMI s third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our users to lose confidence in the effectiveness of PFL s and PMI s data security measures. Further, the CCPA, which was enacted in California, affords individuals in the state affected by data breaches a private right of action against companies that have allegedly been the target of such breaches due to a failure to implement and maintain appropriate cybersecurity policies and procedures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputations, and we could lose users. 
 We use industry standard technologies to maintain secure remote work protocols and protect sensitive data within our control, and we require employees to complete security awareness training at regular intervals. However, we are necessarily limited in our ability to control or ensure the security of networks that employees use to work remotely. 
 Any significant disruption in service in our marketplace or in PMI s computer systems could adversely affect PMI s ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. 
 PMI's ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of its control. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of PMI's technology and its underlying network infrastructure are important to our respective operations, level of customer service, reputation and ability to attract new users and retain existing users. PMI's system hardware is hosted in several hosting facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada; Scottsdale, Arizona; The Dalles, Oregon; and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Our hosting facilities service providers do not guarantee that access to our marketplace or to PMI's own systems will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. The operation of our marketplace and PMI's operation of its own systems depends on our service providers' ability to protect the relevant systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality, temperature, humidity or other environmental concerns, computer viruses or other attempts to harm them, criminal acts and similar events. If PMI's arrangement with any hosting facilities service provider is terminated, or there is a lapse of service or damage to such provider's facilities, PMI could experience interruptions in providing its services under the Administration Agreement, PFL could experience interruptions in the operations of our marketplace, and both could experience delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities. Any interruptions or delays in PMI s performance of its services or in the functioning of and accessibility of our marketplace, whether as a result of a hosting facility service provider or other third-party error, PMI's error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm PFL s relationships with users and its reputation. Additionally, in the event of damage or interruption, PMI's insurance policies may not be sufficient for PMI to adequately compensate PFL for any losses that it may incur. PMI's disaster recovery plan has not been tested under actual disaster conditions, and PMI may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event of an outage at one or more hosting facilities. These factors could prevent PMI from processing or posting payments on the Borrower Loans or the Notes, damage PFL's brand and reputation, divert the attention of PMI's employees, reduce PFL's revenue, subject PMI or PFL to liability and cause users to abandon our marketplace, any of which could adversely affect our respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our marketplace may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. 
 Our marketplace may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. If a hacker were able to infiltrate our marketplace, users would be subject to the increased risk of fraud or borrower identity theft and may experience losses on, or delays in the recoupment of amounts owed on, a fraudulently induced purchase of a Note. Additionally, if a hacker were able to access our secure files, they might be able to gain access to users personal information. While we have taken steps to prevent such activity from affecting our marketplace, if we are unable to prevent such activity, the value of investors investment in the Notes could be adversely affected. 
 Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to perform under the Administration Agreement. 
 Competition for highly skilled technical and financial personnel is extremely intense. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we do and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. 
 In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and 
 33 

training their replacements and the quality of our services and our ability to serve borrower and investors could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect on PMI's ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement and, in such event, PFL s ability to continue to make payments on the Notes could be materially impaired. See Item 1, Business Human Capital Resources for more information about Prosper s employees. 
 PMI may enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, fail to achieve our strategic objectives, disrupt our business or divert management attention. 
 PMI has entered, and may continue to enter, into acquisitions of businesses, technologies and products intended to complement its existing business, solutions, services and technologies. PMI cannot provide assurance that the acquisitions it has made or will make in the future will provide it with the benefits or achieve the results anticipated in entering into the transaction. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including: difficulties assimilating and retaining the management and other personnel, culture and operations of the acquired businesses; potential disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management; difficulties in maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies, including integrating financial reporting and operating systems, particularly with respect to foreign and/or public subsidiaries; potential loss of existing or acquired strategic operating partners, users and customers following an acquisition; difficulties in integrating acquired technologies and products into our solutions and services; and unexpected costs and expenses resulting from the acquisition, and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses. 
 In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, acquisition-related costs and expenses, restructuring charges and write-offs. Acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges. 
 PMI may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If PMI fails to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, PMI may not be able to achieve its anticipated level of growth and its business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Events beyond our control may damage our ability to maintain adequate records, maintain our marketplace or perform the servicing obligations. If such events result in a system failure, investors ability to receive principal and interest payments on the Notes would be substantially harmed. 
 If a catastrophic event resulted in a marketplace outage and physical data loss and/or affected our electronic data storage and back-up storage systems, PFL s ability (and PMI s ability as servicer under the Administration Agreement) to perform its servicing obligations would be materially and adversely affected. Such events include, but are not limited to, fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, computer viruses and telecommunications failures. In the event of any marketplace outage or physical data loss described in this paragraph, PFL cannot guarantee that investors would be able to recoup their investment in the Notes. 
 Events beyond our control, such as public health emergencies, international conflicts, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, may damage our ability to continue operations without disruptions, including our ability to attract new borrowers and investors, retain existing investors, as well as the ability of existing borrowers to repay their loans. If such events continued for an extended period of time and PFL is unable to attract sufficient investor purchase commitments from new and existing investors, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 Our business is subject to the risk that external events, such as public health emergencies, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, could disrupt our day-to-day operations and impair the activities of borrowers and investors on our marketplace. Unforeseen events, or the prospect of such events, including acts of war (including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia), terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, and natural disasters such as fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our vendors or result in political or economic instability. These events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive services from our vendors. Any such disruption could also damage our reputation, which would further lower investor or borrower demand for our products. We could also be subject to claims or litigation with respect to losses caused by such disruptions. Our property and business interruption insurance may not cover a particular event at all or be sufficient to fully cover our losses. 
 Additionally, a potential recession or volatility in capital markets as a result of public health emergencies may cause existing investors to cease or significantly decrease their investment in Borrower Loans through our marketplace. For existing borrowers, any resulting work slowdowns or stoppages may directly result in the inability to make loan payments, and may impair investors ability to receive principal and interest payments on the corresponding Notes. If such events continued for an extended period of time and PFL is unable to attract sufficient investor purchase commitments from new and existing investors, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Increasing interest rates have adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact our personal loan marketplace, our Credit Card program, and our investments in Borrower Loans. 
 Various economic factors have resulted in a significant increase in interest rates. Such an increase has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on our personal loan marketplace by decreasing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations on Borrower Loans, decreasing the ability of borrowers under our Credit Card program to repay the obligations on their Credit Card, and reducing Borrower Loan origination volume. Borrowers may also be more likely to incur additional unsecured or secured debt in an effort to mitigate the effects of the increase in interest rates, which may further reduce their likelihood of repaying Borrower Loans. The increase in interest rates has, and could continue to, also reduce investor demand for Borrower Loans, as investors may have less capital to invest in Borrower Loans and may seek alternative investment options. Although we have adjusted our pricing to account for the increase in the cost of funds and increased credit risk and may continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to fully offset higher costs through rate increases, which may affect the ability of our investors to generate the risk adjusted returns expected for their investment. 
 In addition, we also invest in Borrower Loans as Loans Held for Sale through our PWIT Warehouse Line. We were also previously invested in Borrower Loans as Loans Held for Sale through our PWIIT Warehouse Line, which was terminated on September 25, 2023 in connection with a securitization transaction. Our investment in Borrower Loans is subject to the interest rate risk applicable to investors outlined above, and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations, or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell Loans Held for Sale that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates, loss assumptions or overall market conditions. To reduce the impact of large fluctuations in interest rates, we hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by entering into a derivative agreement with a financial institution. The derivative agreement that we use to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates may not be able to eliminate the exposure to these changes. Interest rates are sensitive to numerous factors outside of our control, such as government and central bank monetary policy in the United States. Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of interest rates, if we choose not to hedge or fail to effectively hedge our exposure, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The fair value of Loans Held for Sale was 161.5 million and 499.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information regarding the potential impact of the various market risks on our business. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE AND REGULATION 
 Our marketplace must comply with regulatory regimes applicable to consumer credit transactions as well as with regulatory regimes applicable to securities transactions. Certain state laws generally regulate interest rates and other charges and require certain disclosures, and also require licensing for certain activities. In addition, other state laws, public policy and general principles of equity relating to the protection of consumers, unfair and deceptive practices and debt collection practices may apply to the origination, servicing and collection of Borrower Loans in our marketplace. We are also subject to other laws, such as: 
 the federal Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, which require certain disclosures to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans; 
 the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, which amended the federal Truth-in-Lending Act and requires additional procedures, disclosures, fee limits and other protections for consumers applying for or holding open end credit cards; 
 the Fair Credit Billing Act, which amended the federal Truth-in-Lending Act and creates creditor obligations with respect to billing complaints and errors for credit card customers; 
 the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, which prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit on the basis of age, race, color, sex, religion, marital status, national origin, receipt of public assistance or the exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act; 
 the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, which regulates the use, reporting and disclosure of information related to each applicant s credit history; 
 the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F, which regulates debt collection practices by debt collectors and prohibits debt collectors from engaging in certain practices in collecting, and attempting to collect, outstanding personal loans; 
 state counterparts to the above consumer protection laws; 
 state and federal securities laws, which require that any non-exempt offers and sales of the Notes be registered; 
 35 

Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, and Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with any consumer financial product or service; 
 the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which includes limitations on financial institutions disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, in certain circumstances requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by nonaffiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and nonaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal customer information, and other privacy laws and regulations; 
 the California Consumer Privacy Act, which provides consumers in the state with extensive rights to know about the use, to request deletion and correction, and to opt out of the sale of their personal information by certain businesses, and which obligates such businesses to notify consumers of their data collection practices and to implement procedures for addressing consumer requests regarding their personal data; 
 the Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection; 
 the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote their full attention to military duties; 
 the federal Military Lending Act, which provides specific protections for active duty service members and their dependents (or covered borrowers) in consumer credit transactions; 
 the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which provide disclosure requirements, guidelines and restrictions on the electronic transfer of funds from consumers bank accounts; 
 the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act and similar state laws, particularly the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures; 
 the federal Bank Secrecy Act, which relates to compliance with anti-money laundering, customer due diligence and record-keeping policies and procedures; 
 the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, which applies to the Home Equity Products; 
 the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, which applies to the Home Equity Products; and 
 state mortgage broker and licensing and registration requirements that meet the minimum standards set forth in the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 and Regulation H. 
 We may not always be in compliance with these laws. Borrowers may make counterclaims regarding the enforceability of their obligations under borrower or consumer protection laws after collection actions have commenced, or otherwise seek damages under these laws. Investors may attempt to rescind their Note purchases under securities laws, and PFL or PMI s failure to comply with such laws could also result in civil or criminal liability. Compliance with these requirements is also costly, time-consuming and limits operational flexibility. See Item 1, Business Government Regulation for more information. 
 There continues to be uncertainty as to how the actions of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or any other new agency could impact our business or that of our issuing bank. 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ), which commenced operations in July 2011, has broad authority over the businesses in which we engage. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices through its regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. 
 We are subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority. The CFPB may therefore request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. In addition, the CFPB may conduct on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, based on, for example, consumer complaints, judicial opinions, or administrative decisions, that we are engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers. In addition, the 
 36 

CFPB finalized a rule for the direct supervision of nonbank installment lenders, which may permit the CFPB to conduct periodic examinations of our business. 
 There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB's strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them. 
 Although we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs, actions by the CFPB or other regulators against us, our issuing banks or our competitors that discourage the use of the marketplace model or suggest to consumers the desirability of other loan products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of borrowers or investors. Our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if the CFPB or other regulators enact new regulations, change regulations that were previously adopted, modify, through supervision or enforcement, past regulatory guidance, or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted. 
 Noncompliance with laws and regulations may impair our ability to facilitate the origination of or service Borrower Loans. 
 Generally, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements may, among other things, limit our or a third party collection agency's ability to collect all or part of the principal amount of or interest on the Borrower Loans on which the Notes are dependent for payment. In addition, non-compliance could subject us to damages, revocation of required licenses, class action lawsuits, administrative enforcement actions, and civil and criminal liability, which may harm PFL's business and ability to maintain our marketplace and may result in borrowers rescinding their Borrower Loans. 
 Where applicable, we seek to comply with state lending, servicing and similar statutes, and we continually evaluate our licensing needs. In U.S. jurisdictions with licensing or other requirements that we believe may be applicable to our marketplace, we have obtained necessary licenses or comply with the relevant requirements. Nevertheless, if we are found to not comply with applicable laws, we could lose one or more of our licenses or face other sanctions, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to continue to facilitate the origination of Borrower Loans through our marketplace, and on our ability to perform servicing obligations or make our marketplace available to borrowers in particular states, which may impair investors' ability to receive the payments of principal and interest on the Notes that they expect to receive. 
 If our marketplace were found to violate a state's usury laws, we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed. 
 If our marketplace were found to violate a state's usury laws, we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed. The interest rates that are charged to borrowers and that form the basis of payments to investors through our marketplace are based upon the ability under federal law of the issuing bank that originates the loan to export the interest rates of the state where it is located and on our ability to assist the bank in arranging such loans. WebBank, the bank that issues personal loans through our marketplace, exports the interest rates of Utah, which allows parties to generally agree by contract to any interest rate . As of December 31, 2023, the Borrower Loans carried interest rates that range from 5.46 to 33.00 , which equate to an effective interest rate for Note investors that range from 4.46 to 32.00 . Some states where borrowers are located, including Utah, have no statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans, while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate less than the current maximum rate offered by WebBank through our marketplace. If a borrower were to successfully bring claims against us for state usury or other state law violations, we could be subject to fines and penalties. Further, if the current structure under which WebBank makes personal loans through our marketplace were successfully challenged, we may have to substantially modify our business operations and may be required to maintain state-specific licenses and only provide a limited range of interest rates for Borrower Loans, all of which may substantially reduce our operating efficiency and attractiveness to investors and possibly result in a decline in our operating results. Recent litigation has successfully challenged lending arrangements in which banks or other exempt entities make loans and sell those loans to a third party charged with servicing the loans. 
 In addition, it is possible that state usury laws may impose liability that could affect an assignee's (i.e., PFL's and/or an investor who purchases Borrower Loans from PFL) ability to continue to charge to borrowers the interest rates that they agreed to pay at origination of their Borrower Loans. 
 As discussed in Part I, Item 1, Business Government Regulation State Usury Laws above, in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC , in May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. On November 10, 2015, the defendant in the Madden case filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court for further review of the Second Circuit s decision. On June 27, 2016, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition and refused to review the case, leaving the decision of the Second Circuit intact and binding on federal courts in Connecticut, New York and Vermont. The Madden decision has created some uncertainty as to whether non-bank entities purchasing loans originated by a 
 37 

bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws, and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest in accordance with the terms of Borrower Loans. While the decision specifically addressed preemption under the National Bank Act, it could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions, including an FDIC-insured, state chartered industrial bank like WebBank. However, although there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any potential litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on our marketplace, we believe the Madden case addressed facts that are not presented by our marketplace lending platform and thus would not apply to Borrower Loans. 
 In June 2020, the FDIC issued a final regulation entitled Federal Interest Rate Authority that, among other things, addressed the uncertainty resulting from the Madden decision, including uncertainty affecting marketplace lenders that partner with banks. Under the FDIC s rule, which applies to FDIC-insured state-chartered industrial banks such as WebBank, interest on a loan originated by WebBank that was permissible under DIDA at origination is not affected by WebBank s subsequent sale of the loan to PFL. Seven states and the District of Columbia sued the FDIC, however, seeking to have the regulation set aside on Administrative Procedure Act grounds. Three states brought a similar challenge in the same court to a similar regulation issued by the OCC under the NBA. Both suits were decided in February 8, 2022, with the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruling that the FDIC and OCC had not exceeded their statutory authority when promulgating their respective rules. The court deferred to each federal agency's interpretation, and thus concluded that each agency s rule was not unreasonable or arbitrary or capricious. The states had until April 11, 2022 to appeal the rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and did not do so. 
 On August 18, 2020, WebBank, the originator and lender of loans offered through the personal loan marketplace, was among the parties that reached a settlement with the Administrator of the Colorado Uniform Consumer Credit Code which provides a safe harbor for the platforms operated by Marlette Funding, LLC and Avant, Inc., such that if the programs meet certain criteria related to oversight, disclosure, funding, licensing, consumer terms, and structure, the programs will be deemed to be in compliance with Colorado s usury limits. On November 9, 2020, we amended our agreements with WebBank to meet the requirements of the safe harbor for extending credit to borrowers in Colorado. 
 We had separately been in discussions with the Colorado Administrator during the Marlette and Avant litigation regarding certain terms of Borrower Loans offered through the personal loan marketplace to Colorado residents. Effective as of July 30, 2019, we and the Administrator entered into a stipulation (the Stipulation to allow loans to continue to be offered through the personal loan marketplace to Colorado residents, subject to certain financing charge and late fee restrictions during the period that the Stipulation is in effect with respect to acquired loans, but excluding loans retained by WebBank or sold to a state-chartered, FDIC-insured bank or a federally-chartered bank. Effective as of February 6, 2024, we entered into a Stipulation and Final Agency Order FAO pursuant to which Prosper agreed to continue to be subject to such financing charge and late fee restrictions set forth in the Stipulation through July 1, 2024. 
 We and our counsel are monitoring these matters closely and, as developments warrant, we will consider any necessary changes to our marketplace required to avoid the impact of these cases on our business model. Because of investor demand, the maximum annual percentage rates offered through our marketplace may be lower in some states than others. 
 We rely on agreements with WebBank, pursuant to which WebBank originates personal loans on a uniform basis to qualified borrowers throughout the United States and sells and assigns those loans to PFL. If our relationships with WebBank were to end, we may need to rely on individual state lending licenses or partner with a different bank to offer Borrower Loans. 
 Borrower Loan requests take the form of an application to WebBank submitted through our marketplace. WebBank currently makes all personal loans to borrowers through our marketplace, which allows our marketplace to be available to borrowers on a uniform basis throughout the United States. If our relationships with WebBank were to end or if WebBank were to cease operations, one or both of PMI and PFL may need to rely on individual state lending licenses or we would need to partner with a different bank to originate Borrower Loans. Because neither of us currently possesses all required licenses to lend in every state, we might be forced to limit the rates of interest charged on Borrower Loans in some states and we might not be able to originate personal loans in some states altogether. If we partner with a new bank, service on our marketplace could be disrupted and delayed as we transition to a different bank partner. We also may face increased costs and compliance burdens if the agreements with WebBank are terminated. 
 Several lawsuits have sought to recharacterize certain loan marketers and other originators as lenders. If litigation or a regulatory enforcement action on similar theories were successful against one or both of PMI and PFL, Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace could be subject to state consumer protection laws and licensing requirements in a greater number of states. 
 Several lawsuits in the lending industry primarily involving high-interest payday loan marketers have brought under scrutiny the association between those firms and out-of-state banks. These lawsuits assert the loan marketers use out-of-state lenders in order to evade the consumer protection laws imposed by the states where they do business. Such litigation has sought 
 38 

to re-characterize the loan marketer as the lender for purposes of state consumer protection law and usury restrictions. Similar civil actions have been brought in the context of gift cards and retail purchase finance. Although we believe that our activities are generally distinguishable from the activities involved in these cases, a court or regulatory authority could disagree. 
 Additional state consumer protection laws would be applicable to the Borrower Loans facilitated through our marketplace if one or both of us were re-characterized as a lender, and the Borrower Loans could be voidable or unenforceable. In addition, we could be subject to claims by borrowers, as well as enforcement actions by regulators. Even if we were not required to cease doing business with residents of certain states or to change our business practices to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be required to register or obtain licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on us. 
 As online commerce develops, federal and state governments may draft and propose new laws to regulate commerce over the Internet, which may negatively affect our businesses. 
 As online commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal and state governments becomes more likely. Our businesses could be negatively affected by the application of existing laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws applicable to marketplace lending. The cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, and we may be unable to pass along those costs to our users in the form of increased fees. In addition, federal and state governmental or regulatory agencies may decide to impose taxes on services provided online. These taxes could discourage the use of the Internet as a means of consumer lending, which would adversely affect the viability of our marketplace. 
 If one or both of PMI and PFL is required to register under the Investment Company Act, either of our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected. 
 The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which investment companies are permitted to conduct their business activities. PFL and PMI believe each has conducted its business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an investment company. If, however, PFL is deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, it may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and its activities may be restricted, which would materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Any determination that PMI is an investment company under the Investment Company Act similarly could impair its ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement and thereby impair PFL s ability to make payments on the Notes. If PFL or PMI were deemed to be an investment company, PFL or PMI may also attempt to seek exemptive relief from the SEC, which could impose significant costs and delays on their businesses. 
 If one or both of PMI and PFL is required to register under the Investment Advisers Act, either of our ability to conduct business could be materially adversely affected. 
 The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisers Act, contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which investment advisers are permitted to conduct their business activities. PFL believes that its business consists of providing a platform for marketplace lending for which investment adviser registration and regulation do not apply under applicable federal or state law, and does not believe that it is required to register as an investment adviser with either the SEC or any of the various states. The SEC or a state securities regulator could reach a different conclusion, however. Registration as an investment adviser could adversely affect PFL s method of operation and revenues. For example, the Investment Advisers Act requires that an investment adviser act in a fiduciary capacity for its clients. Among other things, this fiduciary obligation requires that an investment adviser manage a client s portfolio in the best interests of the client, have a reasonable basis for its recommendations, fully disclose to its client any material conflicts of interest that may affect its conduct and seek best execution for transactions undertaken on behalf of its client. It could be difficult for PFL to comply with this obligation without meaningful changes to its business operations, and there is no guarantee that it could do so successfully. If PFL were ever deemed to be in non-compliance with applicable investment adviser regulations, it could be subject to various penalties, including administrative or judicial proceedings that might result in censure, fine, civil penalties (including treble damages in the case of insider trading violations), the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or other adverse consequences. Similarly, any determination by regulators that PMI must register as an investment adviser could materially adversely affect PMI and impair its ability to continue to administer our marketplace on PFL s behalf. 
 PMI's administration of Quick Invest under its previous offering and PFL s administration of Quick Invest, Recurring Investment, and Auto Invest under its current offering, could create additional liability for PFL and such liability could be material. 
 Quick Invest was a loan search tool that allowed investors to identify Notes that met their investment criteria. An investor using Quick Invest was asked to indicate (i) the Prosper Rating or Ratings they wished to use as search criteria, (ii) the total amount they wished to invest, and (iii) the amount they wished to invest per Note. Quick Invest then compiled a basket of Notes for their consideration that met their search criteria. 
 39 

Recurring Investment (formerly known as Auto Quick Invest) is an automated loan search tool that allows investors to easily invest in Notes that meet their specific investment criteria by automatically bidding any available funds in their account on Notes that match their selected parameters, in accordance with their specified instructions. An investor using Recurring Investment is asked to indicate (i) the Prosper Rating or Ratings and term of the Notes they wish to use as search criteria, and (ii) the amount they wish to invest per Note. If they wish, the investor can further customize their investment criteria by applying one or more of several dozen additional search criteria, such as loan amount, debt-to-income ratio and credit score. The investor can also set aside a specific amount of their funds as a cash reserve that will not be invested by the Recurring Investment tool. After the investor has entered and saved the parameters of their search, Recurring Investment automatically (i) runs searches on the designated criteria as new listings are posted on the marketplace, and (ii) places bids on any Notes identified by each such search. Currently, the Recurring Investment tool is available only through our website, and is not available through our mobile app, Prosper Invest. 
 Auto Invest is an automated loan search tool that makes it easier for investors to build their desired portfolio of Notes by automatically investing any available funds in an investor s account in Notes that match the investor s specified investment criteria and allocation targets. An investor using Auto Invest is asked to select (i) a loan allocation target, or a target mix of loans based on Prosper Ratings, and (ii) the amount they wish to invest per Note. The investor has the option of selecting a target from Prosper s series of preset loan allocations based on the recent historical loan inventory on the marketplace, any of which may be customized by changing the individual allocation targets for each Prosper Rating, or they can create a custom loan allocation target across Prosper Ratings based on their specific risk tolerance. If they wish, the investor can further customize their investment criteria by applying additional filters, such as loan term and employment status. The investor can also set aside a percentage of their portfolio as a cash reserve that will not be invested by Auto Invest. Investors may update their target allocations, cash reserve and other investment criteria, and pause and restart Auto Invest, at any time. Once the investor turns on Auto Invest, the tool may immediately begin placing orders for Notes in accordance with the investor s current and target allocations and other criteria. The mix of Notes in any particular order may not match the investor s individual loan allocation targets, but over time Auto Invest will place orders so that the aggregate holdings in the investor s portfolio will approximate, to the extent possible, the allocation specified in their investment criteria. 
 Since the Notes purchased through Recurring Investment, Auto Invest and Quick Invest are the same as Notes purchased manually, they present the same risks of non-payment as all Notes that may be purchased through our marketplace. For example, there is a risk that a Borrower Loan identified through Recurring Investment, Auto Invest or Quick Invest may become delinquent or default, and that the estimated return or historical return (as applicable) for that loan individually, or the estimated return or historical return (as applicable) for the allocation target or the basket of Notes selected by Recurring Investment, Auto Invest or Quick Invest as a whole, may not accurately reflect the actual return on such loan or Notes. If this were to occur, an investor who purchased a Note from PFL through Recurring Investment, Auto Invest or Quick Invest could pursue a claim against PFL in connection with its representations regarding the performance of the Borrower Loans bid upon through Recurring Investment, Auto Invest or Quick Invest, respectively. An investor could pursue such a claim under various anti-fraud theories under federal and state securities law. 
 We may face liability under state and federal securities law for statements in our prospectus and in other communications that could be deemed to be an offer to the extent that such statements are deemed to be false or misleading. 
 Loan listings and other borrower information available on PFL's website as well as in sales and listing reports are statements made in connection with the purchase and sale of securities that are subject to the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. In general, these liability provisions provide a purchaser of the Notes with a right to bring a claim against one or both of us for damages arising from any untrue statement of material fact or failure to state a material fact necessary to make any statements made not misleading. Even though PFL and PMI have advised investors of what they believe to be the material risks associated with an investment in the Notes and PMI management rights, the SEC or a court could determine that they have not advised investors of all of the material facts regarding an investment in the Notes and PMI Management Rights, which could give investors the right to rescind their investment and obtain damages, and could subject PFL and PMI to civil fines or criminal penalties in addition to any such rescission rights or damages. 
 PMI and PFL s activities in connection with the offer and sale of securities through our marketplace could result in potential violations of federal securities law and result in material liability to PFL and/or PMI. 
 PFL and PMI s respective businesses are subject to federal and state securities laws that may limit the kinds of activities in which PFL and PMI may engage and the manner in which they engage in such activities. For example, changes to the manner in which PFL offers and sells Notes or other securities through our marketplace could be viewed by the SEC or a state securities regulator as involving the creation or sale of new, unregistered securities. In such circumstances, the failure to register such securities could subject PFL to liability and the amount of such liability could be meaningful. In addition, in 2008, PMI entered into a settlement with the SEC pursuant to which PMI agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations or any future violations of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act. Failure to comply with that order could result in material civil or criminal liability, which could materially adversely affect PMI s business and PFL s offering of Notes.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 Risk Management and Strategy 
 Prosper recognizes the critical importance of protecting the company s assets and customer data against new and existing risks using appropriate organizational measures, policies, procedures, and technical solutions while maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 
 Managing Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 
 Prosper has strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our information security InfoSec team works closely with our information technology team to evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs. 
 Third-Party Risk Management Engagement 
 Prosper engages with a range of external experts, including external auditors, cybersecurity assessors and penetration testers as part of our InfoSec and cybersecurity programs. Our collaboration with these third-parties includes services such as external audits, threat assessments and guidance on key security initiatives. These partnerships allow us to leverage specialized knowledge and insights, consistent with our aim for industry-best practices. 
 Oversee Third-Party Risk 
 Prosper maintains stringent processes to oversee and manage the risks associated with third-party service providers, including a team focused on vendor, enterprise, and procurement risk management. We conduct diligence and security assessments of material third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. This monitoring includes an initial review of their information security program, annual re-assessments, and ongoing monitoring for security incidents. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from our material vendors and partners. 
 Risks from Cybersecurity Threats 
 For a description of the cybersecurity risks which could materially affect Prosper s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition , please refer to the following: (i) Risk Factors If the security of PFL's investors' and borrowers' confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, users' secure information may be stolen, our reputations may be harmed, and we may be exposed to liability, (ii) Risk Factors Any significant disruption in service in our marketplace or in PMI s computer systems could adversely affect PMI s ability to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement, and (iii) Risk Factors Our marketplace may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. We and certain third party vendors occasionally have experienced cyber-attacks, breaches of our and their systems and other similar incidents, which to-date have not had a material effect on Prosper s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 Governance 
 The Board of Directors is acutely aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Board has established oversight mechanisms to ensure effective governance in managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. 
 Board of Directors Oversight of Risks 
 The Board is directly responsible for overseeing risks related to cybersecurity and is composed of board members with diverse expertise, including risk management, technology, and finance, equipping them to oversee cybersecurity risks effectively. 
 The Board is informed of cybersecurity risks by our Chief Executive Officer CEO and General Counsel GC ), who are kept updated on an ongoing basis of cybersecurity risks through our Chief Technology Officer CTO and Head of Information Security (the InfoSec Director ). Our InfoSec Director also prepares a quarterly update for each Board meeting that updates the Board of any information security and cybersecurity risks and threats to our systems. The InfoSec Director also 
 42 

will meet with the Board directly for training focused exclusively on our cybersecurity and information security program and risks, beginning in 2024. 
 Risk Management Personnel 
 Primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring, and managing our cybersecurity risks rests with our InfoSec Director. Our InfoSec Director has experience building global Information Security programs and has advised organizations across several highly- regulated industries, including financial services, technology, healthcare, government, non-profit, and retail. Our InfoSec Director, with oversight from the CTO, manages Prosper s information security risk management program and informs Prosper s Enterprise Risk Information Security Committee eRISC ), which consists of members of Prosper s management team and includes our CEO, Chief Financial Officer CFO ), CTO, and GC, regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cyber risks and incidents. The cybersecurity team has decades of experience in selecting, deploying, and operating cybersecurity technologies, initiatives, and processes. eRISC meets on at least a quarterly basis to discuss any cybersecurity incident reports, as applicable, ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies, take any actions approved by the voting members of eRISC, and discuss escalation and reporting to the Board, as needed. 
 Process for Monitoring Cybersecurity Incidents 
 The InfoSec Director and eRISC, as applicable, are continually informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity including potential threats and innovative risk management techniques. The InfoSec Director is an active thought leader and speaker within the CISO community, regularly participating in cybersecurity conferences such as FS-ISAC, and CISO summits. This ongoing knowledge acquisition is crucial for the effective prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. The InfoSec Director implements and oversees processes for the regular monitoring of our information systems. This includes the deployment of advanced security measures and regular system audits to identify potential vulnerabilities. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the InfoSec Director is equipped with a well-defined incident response plan. This plan includes immediate actions to mitigate the impact and long-term strategies for remediation and prevention of future incidents. 
 Reporting to Board of Directors 
 As discussed above in Cybersecurity Board of Directors Oversight of Risks, our InfoSec Director regularly updates our eRISC committee regarding all aspects related to cybersecurity risks and incidents and also maintains direct communication with the CEO, CFO, CTO, and GC for escalation of such incidents directly to the Board. This ensures that the highest levels of management and the Board are kept informed of the cybersecurity posture and potential risks facing Prosper.

 PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC. 
 Overview 
 Our vision is to transform lives by providing affordable financial solutions through the simplest and most trusted platform. We currently offer access to three lending products, each of which supports our vision: (i) unsecured personal loans through a personal loan marketplace which connects eligible consumer borrowers with individual and institutional investors, (ii) a Credit Card product available to eligible borrowers, and (iii) Home Equity Products available to eligible homeowners. 
 We believe our business model has key advantages relative to traditional banks, including (i) an innovative marketplace model that efficiently connects qualified supply and demand of capital, (ii) online operations that substantially reduce the need for physical infrastructure and improve convenience, and (iii) use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence to deliver simple, fast, personalized, and transparent solutions that can improve consumers financial health as they move across the credit spectrum. We do not operate physical branches or incur expenses related to infrastructure like traditional banks or consumer finance institutions. As part of operating our marketplace, we verify the identity of borrowers and assess borrowers credit risk profile using a combination of public and proprietary data. Our proprietary technology automates several loan origination and servicing functions, including the borrower application process, data gathering, underwriting, credit scoring, loan funding, investing and servicing, regulatory compliance and fraud detection. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, our marketplace facilitate d 2.2 billion in Borrower Loan originations, of which 1.9 billion were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing 89 of t he total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, our marketplac e facilitated 442.8 million in Borrower Loan originations, of which 391.2 million were originated through our Whole Loan Channel, representing 88 of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during this period. From inception through December 31, 2023 our marketplace has fa cilitated 25.6 billion in Borrower Loan originations, of which 23.0 billion were funded through our Whole Loan Channel, representing 90 of the total Borrower Loans originated through our marketplace during t his period. 
 As a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers ability or desire to participate on our marketplace as borrowers or investors and, consequently, could negatively affect our business and results of operations.

Key Operating and Financial Metrics (in thousands) 
 The following table displays our key operating and financial metrics for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021: 
 Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Personal Loan Originations 2,164,079 3,340,433 1,946,974 Transaction Fees, Net 127,838 162,742 89,364 Whole Loans Outstanding (1)

 (2) Adjusted Net Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding these measures and the reconciliation to Total Net Revenue and Net (Loss) Income, respectively, the most comparable US GAAP measures, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 
 Personal Loan Originations 
 Total personal loan originations on the platfo rm decreased 35 for the year ended December 31, 2023 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in a decrease in Transaction Fees of 34.9 million, or 21 . The personal loan originations decrease for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to reduced investor demand given the rapid increase in interest rates since the first quarter of 2022 and uncertain economic environment. 
 From inception of the Company through December 31, 2023, a total o f 2,057,160 Borrower Loans, totaling 25.6 billion, were originated through our marketplace. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 157,840 Borrower Loans totaling 2.2 billion were originated through our marketplace, as compared to 305,123 Borrow er Loans totaling 3.3 billion o riginated in 2022, which represented a uni t decrease of 48 and a dollar decrease of 35 . Personal loan origination volume by Prosper Rating was as follows for the periods presented (in millions, except percentage): 
 Year Ended December 31, 
 2023 2022 2021 Amount Amount Amount AA 288.8 13 460.3 14 246.2 13 A 293.8 14 507.0 15 373.8 19 B 563.0 26 601.3 18 318.8 16 C 304.1 14 410.0 12 245.8 14 D 227.6 11 300.2 9 104.0 5 E 268.7 12 338.3 10 35.7 2 HR 21.7 1 29.4 1 0.9 Other (1)

 For the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022, the mix of personal loan originations on the Prosper platform reflects a significant decrease in investor appetite for whole loan purchases under the current economic environment, specifically for personal loans not assigned Prosper ratings. These personal loans are sold only to institutional investors and based on specific underwriting criteria and custom risk models developed by these investors. 
 46 

Whole Loans Outstanding 
 We sell Borrower Loans through our Whole Loan Channel, and the outstanding balance of these personal loans serves as a primary driver of our Servicing Assets. Whole loans outstanding decreased 0.2 billion, or 5 , from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily due to decreased year-over-year personal loan originations, as discussed above, as well as the decrease in purchases of personal loans through our consolidated warehouse trusts.

 Total Net Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decrease d 62.2 million, or 31 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was largely attributable to a 34.9 million decrease in Transaction Fees, Net, due to the decrease in personal loan originations during this time, as discussed above. Additionally, Total Net Revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net decreased 13.2 million when compared to 2022, due primarily to higher delinquencies and charge-offs of Loans Held for Sale and securitized Borrower Loans, as the average outstanding balance of these loans has increased from the prior year. Higher interest rates have also led to negative fair value adjustments on these loans held in consolidated warehouse and securitization trusts. These negative fair value adjustments were partially offset by an increase in fair value gains of 11.4 million on the Credit Card Derivative as compared to the prior year due to the overall growth in the underlying portfolio. There was also a 11.3 million decrease from (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans, due primarily to additional incentives provided to whole loan investors incentives driven by market volatility and incentives offered by competitors, as well as a decrease in whole loan originations from the prior year. Finally, there was a 2.6 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net, due in part to accelerated debt issuance costs recognized upon the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line in September 2023 (see Note 11, Debt ), as well as increased Warehouse Line interest expense due to higher interest rates and increased average outstanding balance of whole loans through our consolidated warehouse trusts for the past year. 
 Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 115.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, which is primarily due to the Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants, which is in turn driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock. Specifically, the loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 totals 48.7 million, which compares to a gain of 84.6 million for 2022, a change of 133.3 million. Total Expenses also increased due to the one-time 8.6 million Gain on Forgiveness of PPP Loan in 2022, as the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA formally forgave our Paycheck Protection Program PPP loan in March 2022 (Note 11). We also incurred 12.3 million in Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 on the Term Loan we closed in November 2022 (Note 11). Only 1.5 million in Interest Expense was incurred on that Term Loan in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a combined 36.2 million decrease in Origination and Servicing, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative expenses, as costs decreased in response to lower personal loan originations. A ccordingly, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 177.0 million when compared to the net income generated for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Transaction Fees, Net 
 We earn a transaction fee upon the successful origination of all Borrower Loans facilitated through our marketplace. Specifically, we receive payments from WebBank as compensation for the activities we perform on behalf of WebBank. Our fee is determined by the term and credit grade of the Borrower Loans that we facilitate on our marketplace and WebBank originates. We record the transaction fee revenue net of any fees paid by us to WebBank. 
 We also earn various program fees from our Credit Card product, such as interchange fees, annual fees and late fees, and broker fees from our Home Equity Products. These program and broker fees are recorded within Transaction Fees, Net. 
 Transaction Fees decreased by 34.9 million, or 21 , for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022. This decrease is generally consistent with the lower personal loan origination volume discussed above, with some offsetting benefit from the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule starting in the fourth quarter of 2023. Under the revised WebBank transaction fee schedule, transaction fees now range from 1 to 7.99 , depending on the term and credit grade of the Borrower Loan, as compared to 1 to 5 under the previous schedule. Transaction fees above 5 are refundable on a pro-rated basis upon the full prepayment of the related personal loan under Utah law, where WebBank is domiciled, and thus the impact of these increased transaction fees is reduced by expected refunds. The decrease was also partially offset by growth in our Credit Card product, as we recognized approximately 18.1 million in program fees under our Credit Card product for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 7.0 million for 2022, an increase of 11.1 million. 
 Servicing Fees, Net 
 Investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel typically pay us a servicing fee which is generally set at 1.0 per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment, plus an additional 0.075 per annum to cover the Loan Trailing Fee. The Servicing Fee compensates us for the costs incurred in servicing the Borrower Loan, including managing payments from borrowers, payments to investors and maintaining investors account portfolios. We record Servicing Fees from investors as a component of operating revenues when received. We also include any collection fees received, net of collection agency expenses, in Servicing Fees. 
 48 

In addition, we are contractually obligated to service the entire portfolio under our Credit Card product. Our banking partner, Coastal, pays us a servicing fee of 1 per annum of the daily outstanding principal balance of all cards designated as Coastal allocations (approximately 10 of the portfolio). To the extent that these contractual fees are less than the market servicing rate that would be required by a market participant to service the entire portfolio, a servicing obligation is recorded. Changes to this servicing obligation are included in Servicing Fees, Net. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023 , Servicing Fees, Net remained relatively flat year-over-year with an increase of 0.3 million, or 2 . This increase is primarily due to a combined increase of 5.8 million in whole loan servicing revenues and debt sale fees during this period, as well as a 0.4 million increase in net loan trailing fees, due to the increase in the balance of whole loans outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a 3.5 million net decrease in collection fees, generally due to an increase in charge-offs and additional spend on collection agencies compared to 2022. Additionally, there was a 2.3 million increase in the net Credit Card servicing obligation (reducing Servicing Fees) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, due to the growth in the portfolio. 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans consists of net (losses) gains on Borrower Loans sold through the Whole Loan Channel, net of any incentives provided at the time of sale. Starting in the second half of 2022, due to market volatility and incentives offered by competitors, we provided additional incentives to our whole loan investors. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these incentives increased 7.2 million from the prior year. Excluding the impact of these incentives, the remaining decrease in (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans of 4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, was primarily due to decrease in the volume of whole loans sold due to lower personal loan originations, as discussed above. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other Revenues consists primarily of credit referral and incentive fees. Credit referral fees are earned from partner companies for the referral of customers on our platform, while incentive fees are earned from partner companies through our incentive programs. The 0.3 million, or 5 , decrease in Other Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily related to incentive fees due to a specific program that terminated in June 2022. 
 Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale and Interest Expense on Financial Instruments 
 We recognize Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent we believe it to be collectible. We record interest expense on the corresponding Notes, Notes Issued by Securitization Trust and Warehouse Lines based on the contractual interest rates. The interest rate on Notes is generally 1 lower than the interest rate on the corresponding Borrower Loans to compensate us for servicing the underlying Borrower Loans. Additionally, Interest Expense associated with Term Loan proceeds used to purchase Loans Held for Sale through our Warehouse Lines is allocated to Net Interest Income. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we allocate d 0.2 million i n Interest Expense on the Term Loan to Net Interest Income. 
 The decrease of 2.6 million, or 10 , in Total Interest Income (Expense) for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to the 1.9 million of accelerated debt issuance costs recorded upon the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line, combined with a net 4.8 million decrease from Loans Held for Sale and Warehouse Lines, as market interest rates drove an increase in the cost of borrowing on the variable interest Warehouse Lines. These were partially offset by additional net interest income from securitized Borrower Loans and Notes of 3.0 million, collections accounts of 0.9 million and Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel of 0.4 million. 
 Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 We record Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Notes and the Credit Card Derivative (see Note 5 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements) at fair value. Changes in the fair value of Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel are largely offset by the changes in fair value of the Notes due to their borrower payment-dependent structure. Our obligation to pay principal and interest on Notes is equal to the loan payments, if any, that are received on the corresponding Borrower Loan, net of the servicing fee, which is generally 1.0 of the outstanding balance. 
 We use Warehouse Lines to finance the purchase of Loans Held for Sale for the purpose of earning Net Interest Income and contributing to securitization transactions. Loans Held for Sale consist primarily of loans held in warehouse trusts. Changes in the fair value of Loans Held for Sale are not offset by changes in the fair value of Warehouse Lines because Warehouse Lines are carried at amortized cost. See Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more details on Warehouse Lines. 
 49 

In September 2023, we sponsored and consolidated a securitization transaction, the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction, with loans that were previously funded through our PWIIT Warehouse Line. Refer also to Note 7, Securitization, of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this securitization transaction. We expect that changes in the fair value of Borrower Loans held by PMIT 2023-1 will be negative due to delinquencies and charge-offs, but they could ultimately be negative or positive due to changes in fair value assumptions, such as expected credit performance, prepayment rates and implied market discount rates. Notes issued by PMIT 2023-1 are carried at amortized cost on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet, and thus do not impact the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 
 We earn interest income on loans held in warehouse trusts during the period we own or consolidate the loans, which partially offsets changes in the fair value of those loans. The following tables illustrate the composition of the loans held in warehouse and securitization trusts by Prosper Rating, which is an indicator of their credit quality: 
 Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Loans Held for Sale (1) : 
 AA 28 28 A 27 27 B 22 22 C 12 13 D 6 6 E 4 4 HR 1 Grand Total 100 100 (1) The percentages are calculated as the weighted average of month-end principal balances of Loans Held for Sale by Prosper Rating. 
 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 Borrower Loans - Securitization (2) : 
 AA 24 A 26 B 23 C 13 D 7 E 6 HR 1 Total 100 (2) The percentages are calculated using the weighted-average of month-end principal balances of Borrower Loans by Prosper Rating. 
 
 Fair values of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The key assumptions used include default and prepayment rates derived primarily from historical performance, and discount rates based on estimates of the rates of return that investors would require w hen investing in other financial instruments with similar characteristics. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net we re losses of 22.9 million and 9.7 million, respectively. 
 50 

The increase in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the prior year is largely driven by Loans Held for Sa le, due to higher delinquencies and charge-offs combined with the impact from higher interest rates as the outstanding balance of Loans Held for Sale continued to increase until the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction was completed on September 25, 2023. The loss from changes in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 39.3 million, due to a 11.3 million loss on fair value and 28.0 million in net charge-offs. This compares to 2022, when there was a loss from changes in fair value of 25.0 million, due to a 13.2 million loss on fair value and 11.8 million in net charge-offs. 
 For fractional Borrower Loans and Notes, the net impact to the Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments was a 0.1 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the borrower payment-dependent structure described above. In 2022, the net impact from these fractional Borrower Loans and Notes was a 0.4 million gain. For Borrower Loans held in PMIT 2023-1, the loss from changes in fair value was 8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and related primarily to delinquencies and charge-offs. 
 The Credi t Card Derivative is recorded at fair value and is primarily reflective of discounted future cash flows from certain features of our Credit Card program that were determined to meet the definition of freestanding derivatives, including interest income, program fees paid to our banking partner Coastal, credit losses and fraud losses. These cash flows are estimated based upon a set of valuation assumptions, including default and prepayment rates derived primarily from comparable companies and our own historical performance, and discount rates based on estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in other financial instruments with similar characteristics. See Note 5 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Fair value changes related to future cash flows underlying the Credit Card Derivative resulted in a gain of 26.1 million and the net impact of realized transactions was a loss of 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This compares to the prior year, when fair value changes related to projected future cash flows were 9.8 million, while the net impact of realized transactions was a gain of 4.3 million. These fluctuations in gains and losses on the Credit Card Derivative for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to prior year, are largely reflective of the significant growth in the Credit Card portfolio, given that the Credit Card program was launched in December 2021, partially offset by increased charge-offs. 
 We also hold a swap tion to limit our exposure to fluctuations in SOFR due to our PWIT Warehouse Line, which consists of two classes of loans that bear interest at SOFR plus a defined spread (see Note 11 for further information). The change in fair value of the swaption was a loss of 1.2 million and a gain of 0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely. The decrease in the value of the swaption year-over-year is largely driven by an increase in the strike price of the swaption in 2023.

 52 

Origination and Servicing 
 Origination and Servicing costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our capital markets, collections, customer support and payment processing employees and vendor costs associated with facilita ting and servicing personal loans and our Credit Card product. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2023 of 9.8 million, or 17 , as compared to 2022 was primarily due to 9.0 million decrease in personal loan servicing and origination costs, consistent with the decrease in personal loan originations discussed above. Additionally, compensation costs decreased 4.0 million, driven primarily by decreased headcount, while software and subscription costs decreased 0.7 million. These decreases are partially offset by a 3.5 million increase in third-party servicing costs associated with our Credit Card product, as the underlying portfolio continues to grow, and a 0.6 million increase in depreciation due to the increase in the balance of internal-use software during this time. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and Marketing costs consist primarily of affiliate marketing, search engine marketing, online and offline campaigns, email marketing, public relations and direct mail marketing, as well as compensation expenses such as wages, benefits and stock-based compensation for the employees who support these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, th e decrease of 28.3 million, or 35 , from the prior year is due to an overall reduction in marketing and advertising costs, which is generally in line with the decrease in personal loan originations during this time. This includes decreases in marketing partnership costs of 31.1 million, digital advertising spend and email advertising costs of a combined 2.3 million and direct-to-site advertising costs of 0.4 million. Additionally, marketing consulting costs decreased 0.3 million during this time. These decreases were partially offset by a 5.4 million increase in direct mail costs. Additionally, compensation expense increased 0.6 million, due primarily to the hiring of our new Chief Marketing Officer in May 2023. 
 General and Administrative Research and Development 
 General and Administrative Research and Development costs consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our engineering and product development employees, as well as related vendor costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the decrease of 1.6 million, or 8 , as compared to 2022, was primarily due to an increase of 3.3 million additional capitalized internal-use software and web development costs (reducing the expense). Specifically, these capitalized costs were 14.3 million and 11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by a 1.0 million increase in compensation expense, 0.4 million increase in software and subscriptions and 0.3 million increase in outsourced services. 
 General and Administrative Other 
 General and Administrative - Other expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our accounting and finance, risk, legal, compliance, human resources and facilities employees, professional fees related to legal and accounting and facilities expenses. The increase in General and Administrative - Other for the year ended December 31, 2023 of 3.5 million, or 6 , as compared to 2022 was due primarily to a 2.9 million increase in compensation expense, driven by increased headcount. There was also a 1.7 million increase in software licenses and subscriptions costs to support the overall operations, including the increased headcount. Additionally, various professional services costs, including accounting, tax and legal, contributed a 0.7 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022. Finally, decreases in various facilities, maintenance and depreciation costs in the amount of 1.6 million partially offset the increase for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants was a loss of 48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to an increase in the fair value of the un derlying Convertible Preferred Stock in 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants was a gain of 84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to a decrease in the fair value of the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock in 2022. 
 Gain on Forgiveness of PPP Loan 
 As discussed in Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on March 21, 2022, we were notified by the SBA that all principal and interest under our PPP loan, totaling 8.6 million, was forgiven through a full forgiveness payment made on March 15, 2022 by the SBA to the lender of our PPP loan. As a result, we recognized the entire forgiven principal and interest as Gain on Forgiveness of PPP Loan for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

53 

Impairment Expense 
 We recorded a 0.2 million impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to our operating lease right-of-use assets. This impairment was triggered by the vacancy of a portion of our leased office space and the time expected to find a new subtenant. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Interest Expense on Term Loan 
 We incu rred 12.3 million and 1.5 million in interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the Term Loan we closed with a third-party financial institution in November 2022. Refer to Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the Term Loan, including details of the interest rates. We allocated 0.2 million in Term Loan interest costs to Net Interest Income for the year ended December 31, 2023, as the related Term Loan proceeds were used to purchase Loans Held for Sale through our Warehouse Lines. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other Income, Net w as 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and primarily consists of sublease income, interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other miscellaneous items. T he increase of 1.5 million in Other Income, Net for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher average cash balances (including proceeds from the Term Loan that closed in November 2022) and higher interest rates, partially offset by decreased sublease income. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Adjusted Net Revenue 
 Adjusted Net Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as our Total Net Revenue adjusted to exclude the impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts and certain infrequent or unusual transactions such as the accelerated amortization of PWIIT debt issuance costs. As a result of the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line in September 2023 (see Note 11, Debt), we accelerated the remaining amortization of the related deferred debt issuance costs into interest expense. We exclude the impact of this accelerated amortization because it is non-cash and because of the infrequent nature of the transaction. Management does not believe that it is reflective of our ongoing operating results. We believe it is useful to investors to exclude the impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts to gain insight into the performance of our consolidated loans, independent of market factors that are beyond management s control. 
 Adjusted Net Revenue has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for Total Net Revenue, which has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These limitations include the following: 
 Adjusted Net Revenue excludes the impact of interest rates, which may influence the price that a willing buyer would be willing to pay for our personal loans in a hypothetical arm s length transaction; and 
 Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Net Revenue differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Net Revenue alongside other financial performance measures, including Total Net Revenue and our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Total Net Revenue to Adjusted Net Revenue for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as Net Income (Loss) adjusted for interest income on Cash and Cash Equivalents, Interest Expense on Term Loan, Income Tax Expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets and Goodwill, stock-based compensation expense, Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants and certain infrequent or unusual transactions. Starting with the second quarter of 2023, it is also adjusted for the impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts. Prior periods have been updated to match current period presentation. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a helpful indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other things, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, evaluate our operations and financial performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide investors insight into the manner in which management views the performance of the Company, enhance investors evaluation of our operating results, and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the GAAP financial information provided herein. 
 Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based charges; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest and tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and 
 Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 The major non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them, are outlined below: 
 Changes in the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants liability : We exclude these fair value changes primarily because they are non-cash items and the fair value varies based on the fair value of the underlying preferred stock, varying valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. Their inclusion makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate. 
 Stock-based compensation expense : This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to our employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of our current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to evaluate; therefore, we believe it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation. We also excluded these expenses because they are non-cash. 
 Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill : We incur amortization or impairment of acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill in connection with acquisitions and therefore 
 55 

exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 Gain on Forgiveness of PPP Loan : We recorded a gain on forgiveness when our PPP loan was forgiven by the SBA in the first quarter of 2022. We exclude the impact of this gain because of the infrequent nature of the transaction. Management does not believe that it is reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 Impairment of Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets - We have recognized impairment on our operating lease right-of-use assets related to vacant sublease space and the expected timing of finding new subtenants. We exclude these charges because they are non-cash and because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results. 
 Impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts : See discussion on Adjusted Net Revenue, above. 
 Accelerated amortization of PWIIT debt issuance costs : See discussion on Adjusted Net Revenue, above. 
 Interest Expense on Term Loan : We incur interest expense on the Term Loan we closed in November 2022, which is more fully described in Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Proceeds from the Term Loan are used to fund the operations of the business at our discretion, within certain limitations. This may include, but is not limited to, making investments in our Credit Card product, investing in loans held in our warehouse facilities or meeting operational obligations. We exclude the Term Loan interest expense not associated with proceeds used to invest in loans held in our warehouse facilities from Adjusted EBITDA, as it is based on the overall financing structure of PMI. This differs from Interest Expense on Financial Instruments (part of Total Net Revenues), as the proceeds from those instruments are used exclusively for the purposes of purchasing loans on our marketplace.

 56 

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, is primarily reflective of decreased personal loan originations, changes in the fair value of securitized Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale (other than the impact of market interest rates) and incentives provided to whole loan investors as described above, partially offset by a significant increase in Credit Card net revenues due to growth in the underlying portfolio since the Credit Card program launched at the end of 2021.

 Segment Adjusted EBITDA is our primary segment profitability metric and is calculated as segment revenue less operating expenses that are directly attributable to the segments products. Refer to Note 21 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Net (Loss) Income Before Income Taxes. Segment Adjusted Net Revenue is calculated as segment revenue less the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts and certain unusual or infrequent transactions. For the periods presented above, these adjustments only impact the Personal Loan segment.

Comparison of 2023 and 2022 
 Personal Loan 
 Personal Loan segment net revenues decrease d 44 to 100.9 million in 2023 from 180.7 million in 2022, primarily as a result of (a) a 45.0 million decrease in Transaction Fees, Net, due to the decrease in personal loan originations during this time; (b) a 24.6 million decrease in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, as described above, (c) a 11.3 million decrease in (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans, due primarily to additional incentives provided to whole loan investors driven by market volatility and incentives offered by competitors, combined with the impact from decreases in the volume of whole loans sold due to lower originations; (d) a 0.6 million decrease in Other Revenues, due to the termination of a partner incentive agreement in June 2022; and (e) a 2.6 million decrease in Total Interest Income (Expense), Net, primarily due to the 1.9 million accelerated recognition of debt issuance costs upon the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line in September 2023, combined with the impact from higher Warehouse Line interest expense due to increases in market interest rates, which increased the cost of borrowing on the variable interest Warehouse Lines. These decreases were partially offset by a 4.4 million increase in Servicing Fees, Net, due to the increase in whole loans outstanding during this period, as discussed above. 
 Segment Adjusted Net Revenue associated with the Personal Loan segment decreased 82.5 million in 2023 compared to 2022. This is reflective of the same factors that drove the decrease in net revenues discussed above, excluding the impact of interest rates on the fair value of loans held in consolidated trusts and the accelerated recognition of debt issuance costs upon the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line in September 2023. 
 Adjusted E BITDA associated with the Personal Loan segment decreased 41.3 million in 2023 as compared to 2022. This is primarily reflective of the decrease in net revenues and segment Adjusted Net Revenue discussed above, which was not fully offset by the corresponding decrease in operating expenses. 
 Home Equity 
 For the year ended December 31, 20 23, the decrease in Home Equity segment net revenues and segment Adjusted Net Revenue of 0.9 million is reflective of lower Transaction Fees, Net, due to the decreases in originations during this time. Home Equity segment net revenues consist of broker fees from our lending partners, and Adjusted EBITDA is reflective of these net revenues, offset by operating expenses. 
 Credit Card 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023, Credit Card segment net revenues and segment Adjusted Net Revenue increased 18.6 million or 114 as compared to 2022, primarily as a result of (a) a 11.0 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net; (b) a 11.4 million increase in fair value gains on our Credit Card Derivative, generally due to the overall growth in the Credit Card portfolio during this time; and (c) a 0.3 million increase in other revenue, mainly consisting of credit referral fees earned from partner companies for the referral of customers on our platform. These increases were partially offset by a 4.2 million decrease in Servicing Fees, Net, as a result of an increase in the net servicing obligation related to the Credit Card portfolio. 
 Adjusted EBITDA associated with Credit Card increased 12.8 million in 2023, as compared to 2022, which is primarily reflective of the increase in net revenues discussed above, partially offset by our continued investments in the Credit Card product s growth. 
 Comparison of 2022 and 2021 
 Personal Loan 
 Personal Loan segment net revenues increased 26 to 180.7 million in 2022 from 143.7 million in 2021, primarily as a result of a 64.4 million increase in Transaction Fees, Net, due to the increase in originations during this time, as discussed above. This increase was partially offset by a 8.2 million decrease in Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans, due primarily to additional incentives provided to whole loan investors driven by market volatility and incentives offered by competitors. There was also a 20.6 million decrease in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net, due primarily to volatility in the capital markets and higher interest rates, which led to negative fair value adjustments on the loans we hold in consolidated warehouse trusts. 
 58 

Adjusted EBITDA associated with the Personal Loan segment decreased 58 to 9.3 million in 2022 fro m 22.3 million in 2021, which is primarily reflective of the net revenues discussed above and higher operating expenses to support the higher originations. 
 Home Equity 
 Home Equity segment net revenues increased 198 to 2.8 million in 2022 from 0.9 million in 2021 due to increased broker fees from our Home Lending Partners. 
 Home Equity Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of 2.2 million in 2022, which is reflective of the net revenues discussed above, offset by our continued investments in the Home Equity product, particularly with regards to operations and marketing. In 2021, Home Equity Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of 2.6 million and consisted primarily of the net revenues reflected above, offset by research and development expenses, operations costs and professional fees incurred to ramp up the product after establishing our partnership with Spring EQ in October 2020. 
 Credit Card 
 Credit Card net revenues in 2022 of 16.3 million are primarily reflective of (a) 14.1 million in fair value gains on our Credit Card Derivative and (b) 7.0 million in transaction fees, partially offset by (c) a 3.7 million increase in the servicing obligation related to the Credit Card portfolio. Because we launched our Credit Card product in December 2021, Credit Card segment net revenues were not material in 2021. 
 Adjusted EBITDA associated with Credit Card was a loss of 8.9 million in 2022, which is reflective of the net revenues discussed above, offset by our continued investments in the Credit Card product s success, particularly with regards to research and development expenses, operations and marketing. In 2021, Credit Card Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of 3.8 million and consisted primarily of research and development expenses and professional fees incurred to prepare the product for launch in December 2021. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We have incurred operating losses in prior years and may continue to incur net losses in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred a net loss of 106.5 million and generated net income of 70.6 million, respectively. Additionally, from our inception through December 31, 2023, we have had an accumulated deficit of 590.1 million. 
 We believe our liquidity needs for the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future beyond that period, can be met through transaction fees, servicing fees, net interest income, other revenue, proceeds from sales of loans, realized gains on the Credit Card Derivative and Cash and Cash Equivalents. For further details related to our Term Loan and warehouse lines, see Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The table in the section titled Contractual Obligations below summarizes our current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023. Management monitors our financial results and operations. If the financial results anticipated are not achieved or we fail to maintain compliance with the debt covenants under our Term Loan, our sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to meet our operating and liquidity requirements without obtaining additional liquidity which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods presented (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net (Loss) Income (106,462) 70,582 (138,341) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 47,845 (334,902) 113,563 Net cash used in investing activities (56,951) (95,865) (7,178) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (32,235) 391,751 (84,628) Net (decrease) increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (41,341) (39,016) 21,757 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at the beginning of the period 196,609 235,625 213,868 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at the end of the period 155,268 196,609 235,625 
 Cash, Cash Equivale nts and Restricted Cash decreased by 41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, based on the following components: 
 59 

Operating Activities : 47.8 million in c ash was provided by operating activities, driven by (a) 68.0 million in net proceeds from Loans Held for Sale, partially offset by (b) 10.3 million in net loss, net of non-cash items and (c) 9.9 million in cash used for working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments to investors and third-party vendors, as well as a 9.3 million reclassification of Restricted Cash to Prepaid and Other Assets during the year (see Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). 
 Investing Activities : 57.0 million in cash was used in investing activities due to (a) 232.3 million in purchases of Borrower Loans, and (b) 15.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, primarily consisting of internal-use software, partially offset by (c) 191.1 million from sales and principal payments of Borrower Loans. 
 Financing Activities : 32.2 million in cash was used in financing activities, due primarily to (a) 224.0 million paid for the extinguishment of principal and interest on the PWIIT Warehouse Line, (b) 63.3 million in principal payments on Warehouse Lines, net of proceeds and (c) 3.9 million in debt issuance costs related to the extensions of our PWIIT warehouse facility in February 2023, PWIT warehouse facility in May 2023 and PMIT 2023-1 securitization in September 2023, partially offset by (d) 216.0 million in proceeds, net of payments, from the issuance of PMIT 2023-1 securitization notes and (e) 42.9 million in proceeds, net of payments, from the issuance of Notes, at Fair Value. 
 Income Taxes 
 We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying the statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in prior years, we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. 
 We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. We are required to make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As a result of retaining servicing rights on the sale of Borrower Loans, we are an interest holder in certain special purpose entities that purchase these Borrower Loans. None of these special purpose entities are consolidated as we are not the primary beneficiary. Other than these special purpose entities, as of December 31, 2023, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 As of December 31, 2023, the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): 
 Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years Term Loan 76,719 76,719 Operating lease obligations 18,168 4,497 8,949 4,722 WebBank purchase obligations 17,700 17,700 WebBank minimum origination fees 1,300 1,200 100 Total contractual obligations 113,887 23,397 85,768 4,722 
 Term Loan 
 As discussed in Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the full principal balance and any unpaid interest on the Term Loan is payable upon maturity in November 2026. We incur daily interest that is payable at the end of each month, as well as payment-in-kind interest that is added to the outstanding principal balance if it remains unpaid at the end of the month. 
 60 

WebBank Purchase Obligations 
 Under our loan account program with WebBank, a Utah-charted industrial bank that serves as our primary issuing bank, WebBank retains ownership of loans facilitated through our marketplace for two business days after origination. As part of this arrangement, we have committed to purchase the loans at the conclusion of the two business days. 
 WebBank Minimum Origination Fees 
 We are required to pay WebBank a minimum fee to the extent monthly loan originations due to not meeting certain contractual thresholds. This obligation is more fully discussed in Note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The accounting policies discussed below reflect our most significant judgments, assumptions and estimates which we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results including fair value measurements of (i) Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes; (ii) Loan Servicing Asset and Credit Card Servicing Obligation; (iii) Credit Card Derivative and (iv) Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective in nature and actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, and the differences could be material. For a full description of all accounting policies adopted by us, please see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes 
 We have elected the fair value option for Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes. We primarily use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes. The key assumptions used in the valuation include default rates and prepayment rates derived from historical performance and discount rates that reflect estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in financial instruments with similar characteristics. All these assumptions require significant management judgment. For further information on fair value measurement of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes, refer to Note 8 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Loan Servicing Asset and Credit Card Servicing Obligation 
 We have elected to adopt the fair value method to measure the loan Servicing Asset for all classes of Servicing Assets subsequent to initial recognition. We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the loan Servicing Assets, which incorporates observable inputs such as the contractual servicing fee revenue that we earn on the Borrower Loans and the current principal balances of the loans, as well as significant unobservable inputs such as the estimated market servicing rate to service such loans, the prepayment rates, the default rates and the discount rate. For further information on fair value measurement of the loan Servicing Assets, refer to Note 6 - Servicing Assets and Note 8 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Similarly, we are responsible for servicing the entire portfolio related to our Credit Card product and recognize a servicing obligation liability to the extent servicing fees we expect to earn do not exceed the estimated market servicing rate a market participant would require to service the portfolio. We again use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the Credit Card Servicing Obligation which incorporates observable inputs such as the contractual servicing fee revenue that we earn on the Credit Card portfolio and the current outstanding principal balances of the credit card receivables, as well as significant unobservable inputs such as the estimated market servicing rate to service the portfolio, the prepayment rates, the default rates and the discount rate. For further information on fair value measurement of the Credit Card Servicing Obligations, refer to Note 5 - Credit Card and Note 8 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Credit Card Derivative 
 We evaluated the terms of the Credit Card program agreement and determined that it contained features that met the definition of derivatives under U.S. GAAP. These features are freestanding financial instruments and have been valued separately as derivatives. A right of offset exists between the derivatives, and they are presented net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the various components of the Credit Card Derivative. The key assumptions used in the valuation include default and prepayment rates derived primarily from relevant market data and historical performance, adjusted as necessary based on the perceived credit risk of the underlying cardholder. In addition, discount rates based on estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in similar credit card portfolios are applied to the individual freestanding derivatives. For further information on fair value 
 61 

measurement of the Credit Card Derivative, refer to Note 5 - Credit Card and Note 8 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants 
 Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants primarily consist of warrants to purchase Series E and Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. Series F Warrants were issued to the Consortium and vested when the Consortium purchased whole loans under the Consortium Purchase Agreement, which ended in May 2019. 
 We estimate the fair value of the Series E and Series F Warrants using valuation methods appropriate at each balance sheet date. Generally, this includes determining the business enterprise value of the Company using methods that may include a discounted cash flow model, comparable public company analysis, and comparable acquisition analysis, which require significant management judgment. Additionally, we review and consider any recent transactions involving the Company's equity in determining whether such transactions should be considered in the valuation. Once the business enterprise value has been estimated, an option pricing model is used to allocate the value to the various classes of our equity. The concluded per share value for the Series E and Series F Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant is then determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that requires us to make key assumptions such as volatility and expected warrant term. For further information on fair value measurement of the Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants, refer to Note 8 - Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities and Note 13 - Convertible Preferred Stock, Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability and Common Stock of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 PROSPER FUNDING LLC 
 Overview 
 Prosper Funding was formed in the state of Delaware in February 2012 as a limited liability company with PMI as its sole equity member. Prosper Funding was formed by PMI to hold Borrower Loans originated through the Note Channel and issue related Notes. Although Prosper Funding is consolidated with PMI for accounting and tax purposes, Prosper Funding has been organized and is operated in a manner that is intended to minimize the likelihood that it would be substantively consolidated with PMI in a bankruptcy proceeding. Prosper Funding s intention is to minimize the likelihood that its assets would be subject to claims by PMI s creditors if PMI were to file for bankruptcy, as well as to minimize the likelihood that Prosper Funding will become subject to bankruptcy proceedings directly. Prosper Funding seeks to achieve this by placing certain restrictions on its activities and by implementing certain formal procedures designed to expressly reinforce its status as a distinct corporate entity from PMI. 
 As a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are more highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends, real or perceived, in the markets driven by, among other factors, general economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customers ability or desire to participate in our marketplace as borrowers or investors, and consequently could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 
 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 The following table summarizes Prosper Funding s net income for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change Change 2022 2021 Change Change Total Net Revenues 63,224 86,987 (23,763) (27) 86,987 62,757 24,230 39 Total Expenses 65,290 83,464 (18,174) (22) 83,464 59,547 23,917 40 Net (Loss) Income (2,066) 3,523 (5,589) n/m 3,523 3,210 313 10 
 
 Total revenues for the year en ded December 31, 2023 decreased 23.8 million, or 27 , from the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to decreased administration fee revenue driven by a decrease in the number of personal loan listings on our marketplace during the period, partially offset by an increase in incentives provided to whole loan investors (for which PFL bills PMI). Because of the growth in our servicing book, there was a resulting increase in Servicing Fees, Net. There was also a decrease in (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans, due to the increase in incentives provided to whole loan investors, as well as decreased whole loan originations. Because these incentives are reimbursed through the administration fee 
 62 

revenue, there is no net impact on total net revenues. Other Revenues decreased by 0.5 million primarily due to a partner incentive program that terminated in June 2022. To tal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreas ed 18.2 million, or 22 , from 2022, largely due to a decrease in administrative fee expense during the year resulting from a decrease in personal loans funded for the period.

 Administration Fee Revenue - Related Party 
 We primarily generate revenues through license fees we earn under our Administration Agreement with PMI. The Administration Agreement contains a license we grant to PMI that entitles PMI to use the marketplace for, and in relation to: (i) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations under the Administration Agreement, and (ii) PMI s performance of its duties and obligations to WebBank under the Loan Account Program Agreement. The Administration Agreement requires PMI to pay us a monthly license fee that is partially based on the number of personal loan listings posted on the marketplace in that month, as well as a fee based on incentives provided to investors to i ncentivize the purchase of Borrower Loans from PFL. The decrease in Administrative Fee Revenue of 16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to in 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in personal loan listings generated on the marketplace, which resulted in a decrease in Administrative Fee Revenue of 22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was partially offset by a 6.5 million increase related to reimbursements received from PMI for incentives provided to whole loan investors, as discussed above. 
 63 

Servicing Fees, Net 
 Investors who purchase Borrower Loans through the Whole Loan Channel typically pay us a servicing fee which is currently set at 1.0 per annum of the outstanding principal balance of the Borrower Loan prior to applying the current payment, plus an additional 0.075 per annum to cover the Loan Trailing Fee. The Servicing Fee compensates us for the costs incurred in servicing the Borrower Loan, including managing payments from borrowers, managing payments to investors and maintaining investors account portfolios. We record Servicing Fees from investors as a component of operating revenues when received. We also include any collection fees received, net of collection agency expenses, in Servicing Fees, Net. 
 The increase in Servicing Fees of 5.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 was largely due to the growth in the servicing book as compared to the prior year, which resulted in approximately 6.0 million in additional Servicing Fees for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase in 2023 was partially offset by increases in collection agency costs, net of collections and debt sale fees, as we increased our spend on these agencies in response to higher delinquencies. 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans consists of (losses) gains on Borrower Loans sold through the Whole Loan Channel, net of any incentives provided to investors at the time of sale. For the year ended December 31, 2023, PFL recognized a loss of 11.3 million, a decrease of 13.0 million from 2022. This decrease was primarily due to additional incentives provided to whole loan investors, due to market volatility and incentives offered by competitors. These incentives resulted in a 7.2 million decrease in (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans as compared to 2022. Excluding the impact of these incentives, the remaining decrease in (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans of 5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, was primarily due to decrease in the volume of whole loans sold due to lower personal loan originations, as discussed above. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other Revenues consists primarily of incentive fees, which are earned from partner companies through our incentive programs. The 0.5 million decrease in Other Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, is primarily due to a decrease in these incentive fees as we terminated an incentive program in June 2022. 
 Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Interest Expense on Notes 
 We recognize Interest Income on Borrower Loans using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent we believe it to be collectible. We record Interest Expense on the corresponding Notes based on the contractual interest rates. The interest rate on Notes is generally 1 lower than the interest rate on the corresponding Borrower Loans to compensate us for servicing the underlying Borrower Loans. 
 Overall, the 0.5 million increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, was due to an increase in the average outstanding principal balance of Borrower Loans and Notes. 
 Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net 
 Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Net captures gains (losses) in fair value estimates using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The key assumptions used in valuations include default and prepayment rates derived from historical performance and discount rates that reflect estimates of the rates of return that investors would require when investing in other financial instruments with similar characteristics. Changes in fair value of Borrower Loans funded through the Note Channel are largely offset by the changes in fair value of the corresponding Notes due to the borrower payment-dependent structure, though differences will arise due to the actual and projected impact of cash flows related to charge-offs, debt sales and miscellaneous fees. 
 The following table summarizes the fair value adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively (in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Borrower Loans (40,285) (30,436) (1,141) Notes 40,403 30,830 1,911 Total 118 394 770 
 
 64 

The increase in net revenues from Change in Fair Value of Financial Instruments for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, is primarily reflective of increased debt sale fees on charged-off Borrower Loans in 2023. This includes the impact of Borrower Loans transferred to PFL in conjunction with the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction, as discussed in Note 4, Borrower Loans and Notes, at Fair Value , of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Other fair value changes are generally not material, which is consistent with the borrower payment structure described above. 
 Expenses 
 The following table summarizes Prosper Funding s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change Change 2022 2021 Change Change Expenses: Administration Fee Related Party 57,683 74,382 (16,699) (22) 74,382 52,641 21,741 41 Servicing and Other, Net 7,607 9,082 (1,475) (16) 9,082 6,906 2,176 32 Total Expenses 65,290 83,464 (18,174) (22) 83,464 59,547 23,917 40 
 Administration Fee Expense - Related Party 
 Pursuant to our Administration Agreement with PMI, PMI manages the marketplace on our behalf. Accordingly, each month we are required to pay PMI (a) a corporate administration fee of 500,000 per month, (b) a fee for each Borrower Loan originated through the marketplace, (c) 62.5 of all Servicing Fees collected by us or on our behalf and (d) all nonsufficient funds fees collected by us or on our behalf. In general, the Administrative Fee Expense will not fluctuate directly in line with the Administrative Fee Revenue due to both the flat corporate administrative fee, as well as the fact that we pay fees for three different services, but receive a fee based only on the number of personal loans listed on the platform. 
 The decrease in Administration Fee expense of 16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, was due to a drop in the number of Borrower Loans originated through the marketplace during these periods, which contributed a 21.3 million decrease, partially offset by the increase in Servicing Fees, Net, discussed above, which resulted in a 4.4 million increase in Administration Fee - Related Party for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Servicing and Other, Net 
 Servicing costs consist primarily of vendor and borrower costs, as well as depreciation of internal-use software associated with servicing Borrower Loans. The decrease in Servicing costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the decrease in personal loan originations. 
 Other costs consist primarily of bank service charges and professional fees. The change in Other costs for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022 was not significant. 
 Servicing and Other costs are offset by the interest income of 0.6 million and 0.1 million generated from cash invested on our platform during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase from the prior year is primarily related to the change in interest rates. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net (Loss) Income (2,066) 3,523 3,210 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 3,664 (57,439) 32,685 Net cash used in investing activities (47,324) (90,345) (65,416) Net cash provided by financing activities 42,850 77,757 59,683 Net (decrease) increase in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (810) (70,027) 26,952 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at the beginning of the period 97,849 167,876 140,924 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash at the end of the period 97,039 97,849 167,876 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash decreased by 0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, based on the following components: 
 Operating Activities : 3.7 million in cash was provided by operating activities, driven by net income, net of non-cash adjustments of 5.2 million, partially offset by cash used in working capital of 1.6 million, primarily due to the timing of payments to PMI and investors. 
 Investing Acti vities : 47.3 million net cash used in investing activities, due to 232.3 million in purchases of Borrower Loans and 6.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by 191.1 million of principal payments under Borrower Loans. 
 Financing Activ ities : 42.9 million net cash was provided by financing activities, due to 231.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of Notes, at Fair Value, partially offset by 188.7 million in payments for Notes, at Fair Value. 
 Income Taxes 
 We incurred no income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We are a US disregarded entity for income tax purposes and our income and loss is included in the return of our parent, PMI. Given PMI s history of taxable losses, it is difficult to accurately forecast how Prosper s and our results will be affected by the realization and use of net operating loss carry forwards. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As a result of retaining servicing rights on the sale of Borrower Loans, we are a variable interest holder in certain special purposes entities that purchase these Borrower Loans. None of these special interest entities are consolidated as we are not the primary beneficiary. Otherwise as of December 31, 2023, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet financing activities. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 PROSPER MARKETPLACE, INC. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values, or future cash flows that may result from changes in financial market prices and interest rates. 
 Through the Warehouse Lines we invest in Loans Held for Sale and through the securitization trust (formed in September 2023) we hold Borrower Loans. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the market value of these Loans Held for Sale and Borrower Loans on our balance sheet. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations, or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell Loans Held for Sale that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates, loss assumptions or overall market conditions. Recent interest rate increases, due in part to ongoing inflation, may increase the risks of our investments in Loans Held for Sale and Borrower Loans, and additional fluctuations in interest rates may exacerbate such risks. Changes in the market value of Loans Held for Sale are recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of Loans Held for Sale was 161.5 million and 499.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, while the fair value of Borrower Loans held in the consolidated securitization trust was 220.7 million as of December 31, 2023 . 
 
 66 

The fair values of Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, and Notes are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions such as default rate, prepayment rate and discount rate. Default rate, prepayment rate and discount rate may change due to expected loan performance or changes in the expected returns of similar financial instruments available in the market. We are exposed to the risk of a decrease in the fair value of loans held in the warehouse and securitization trusts. For Borrower Loans and Notes presented on our Balance Sheet on behalf of our Note Channel investors, the fair value adjustments for Borrower Loans are largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the Notes due to the borrower payment dependent design of the Notes and due to the total principal balances of the Borrower Loans being very close to the total principal balances of the Notes. 
 We are also exposed to variable interest rate risk under the debt from the Warehouse Lines, which had an outstanding balance of 160.2 million and 446.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. To reduce the impact of large fluctuations in interest rates, we hedged a portion of our interest rate risk by entering into a derivative agreement with a financial institution. The derivative agreement that we use to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates may not be able to eliminate the exposure to these changes. Interest rates are sensitive to numerous factors outside of our control, such as government and central bank monetary policy in the United States. Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of interest rates, if we choose not to hedge or fail to effectively hedge our exposure, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 35.0 million and 83.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were held in various unrestricted deposits with highly rated financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid marketable securities which may include money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Due to their short-term nature, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these liquid investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Decreases in short-term interest rates will moderately reduce interest income on these Cash and Cash Equivalents. Increases in short-term interest rates will moderately increase the interest income earned on the Cash and Cash Equivalents. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 As more fully described in Note 8, Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities, of our financial statements attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the combined fair value of Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale is 706.5 million as of December 31, 2023, determined using a weighted-average discount rate of 6.88 . The combined fair value of Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale was 820.4 million as of December 31, 2022, determined using a weighted-average discount rate of 6.72 . A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result i n a decrease of approximately 6.8 million and 8.3 million in the fair value of PMI s investment in Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of approximately 6.9 million and 8.6 million in the fair value of our investment in Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Any realized or unrealized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate change would be recorded in our statement of operations so long as we hold these Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale on our balance sheet. 
 
 PROSPER FUNDING LLC 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values, or future cash flows that may result from changes in financial market prices and interest rates. 
 Because balances, interest rates, and maturities of Borrower Loans are matched and offset by an equal balance of Notes with the exact same interest rates (net of our servicing fee) and initial maturities, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the net fair value of the combined Borrower Loan and Note portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 The fair values of Borrower Loans and the related Notes are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies based upon a set of valuation assumptions. The fair value adjustments for Borrower Loans are largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the Notes due to the borrower payment dependent design of the Notes and due to the total principal balances of the Borrower Loans being very close to the total principal balances of the Notes. 
 Prosper Funding had Cash and Cash Equivalents of 3.4 million and 6.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were held in various unrestricte d deposits with highly rated financial institutions and short term, highly liquid marketable securities which may include money market funds, U.S. treasury securities and U.S. agency securities. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Due to their short-term nature, Prosper Funding believes that it does not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these liquid investments as a result of changes in interest 
 67 

rates. Decreases in short-term interest rates will moderately reduce interest income on these cash and cash equivalents, while increases in short-term interest rates will moderately increase the interest income earned on these cash and cash equivalent balances.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, each Registrant s management, under the supervision and with the participation of such Registrant s Principal Executive Officer (PEO) and Principal Financial Officer (PFO), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of such Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2023. Based upon this evaluation, the PEO and the PFO of each Registrant have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to each Registrant and its subsidiaries that is required to be disclosed in reports filed with, or submitted to, the SEC under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including its PEO and PFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), each Registrant s management is required to assess the effectiveness of such Registrant s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether such Registrant s internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
 Management of each Registrant is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Each Registrant s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of such Registrant s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Registrants management has assessed the effectiveness of the Registrants internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment the Registrants used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. Each 
 68 

Registrant s assessment included documenting and evaluating the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, the person serving as each Registrant s PEO and PFO has concluded that such Registrant s internal controls were effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act exempts any company that is not a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer (as defined by SEC rules) from the requirement that such company obtain an external audit of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, the Registrants are exempt from the requirement that they include in their Annual Report on Form 10-K an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting by an independent registered public accounting firm; however, management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is still required with respect to the Registrants.

 Election of Directors 
 PMI s board of directors currently consists of eight seats, with one vacancy to be filled by a designee of the Series A Holders, one vacancy to be filled by a designee of the Series A-1 Holders, one vacancy to be filled by a designee of Francisco Partners III, L.P., and one vacancy to be filled by a designee of the Series F Holders. All of the current members of PMI's board of directors were elected as directors pursuant to the terms of a voting rights agreement entered into among certain of PMI s stockholders. In selecting the composition of its board of directors, PMI seeks to ensure that its board of directors collectively has a balance of expertise in the following areas: internet-based business, consumer financial products, business operations, and experience directing public and start-up companies. Based on these criteria, PMI believes that its board of directors has been effective in identifying diverse directors. The board of directors composition provisions of PMI s voting rights agreement are still in effect. For more information regarding the terms of the voting rights agreement, see Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. Holders of the Notes offered through our marketplace, and the accompanying PMI Management Rights, will have no ability to elect or influence PMI s directors or approve significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of PMI or its assets.

Board Leadership 
 Because PMI s common stock is not listed on a national exchange, PMI is not required to maintain a board of directors consisting of a majority of independent directors, or to maintain an audit, nominating or compensation committee. PMI does not have a lead independent director. 
 Code of Ethics 
 Our Board of Directors is committed to a high standard of corporate governance practices and, through its oversight role, believes that it has encouraged and promoted a requisite culture of ethical business conduct among PMI s officers and employees. To memorialize its commitment to these standards, the Board of Directors of PMI adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all of PMI's employees, directors and officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executive officers. A copy of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website at www.prosper.com/plp/legal . We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding amendment to, or waiver from, certain provisions of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct by posting such information on our website or in public filings. 
 Director Independence 
 Because PMI s common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities, PMI is not required to maintain a board of directors consisting of a majority of independent directors or to maintain an audit committee, nominating committee or compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors. Nevertheless, PMI s board of directors has determined the independence of each director based on the independence criteria set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ). In making its determinations, the Board considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances the board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including any transactions between each director or any member of their family, and us, our senior management or our independent registered public accounting firm. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning their background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, the board of directors determined that Ms. Huang and each of Messrs. Kearney and deSilva do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the listing requirements and rules of the NYSE. 
 Board Committees 
 Nominating Committee 
 PMI is not a listed issuer as defined under Section 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. Therefore, PMI is not required to have a nominating committee comprised of independent directors. PMI currently does not have a standing nominating committee and accordingly, there are no charters for such committee. PMI believes that a nominating committee is not necessary for a company of its size with its type of business. PMI also believes that its directors collectively have the requisite background, experience, and knowledge to fulfill the limited duties and obligations that a nominating committee may have. 
 Compensation Committee 
 PMI s board of directors approved the formation of a Compensation Committee in August 2011. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Claire A. Huang (Chairwoman) and Thomas R. Kearney. The Compensation Committee oversees PMI s executive officer compensation arrangements, plans, policies and programs maintained by PMI and administers PMI s equity-based compensation plan for employees generally (including issuance of stock options, RSUs and other equity-based awards granted other than pursuant to a plan). The Compensation Committee meets at such times as determined appropriate by the Chair of the Compensation Committee. 
 The Compensation Committee is exempt from independence listing standards because PMI's common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities. Nevertheless, the board of directors of PMI has determined that each of the current members of PMI s Compensation Committee is independent under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and NYSE. 
 Audit Committee 
 PMI s board of directors approved the formation of an Audit Committee in January 2010. The current members of the Audit Committee are Thomas R. Kearney (Chairman) and Peter J. deSilva. The Audit Committee oversees financial risk exposures, including monitoring the integrity of PMI s consolidated financial statements, internal controls over financial reporting and the independence of PMI s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee receives 
 73 

internal control related assessments and reviews and discusses PMI s annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements with management. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to compliance matters, the Audit Committee meets at least quarterly with management, PMI s Independent Registered Public Accounting firm and PMI s internal legal counsel to discuss risks related to PMI s financial reporting function. 
 The Audit Committee is exempt from independence listing standards because PMI's common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities. Nevertheless, the board of directors of PMI has determined that each of the current members of PMI's Audit Committee is independent under the listing requirements and rules of the NYSE, and also satisfies the independence requirements of Section 10(m)(3) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, PMI's board of directors has determined that each of the current members of the Audit Committee is an audit committee financial expert as defined under SEC regulations and the listing requirements and rules of the NYSE. 
 Limitations on Officers and Directors Liability and Indemnification Agreements 
 As permitted by Delaware law, PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors for breaches of duty to the corporation. PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws limit the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for: 
 any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to PMI or PMI s stockholders; 
 any act or omission not in good faith, believed to be contrary to the interests of PMI or its shareholders, involving reckless disregard for the director s duty, for acts that involve an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of duty, or that involves intentional misconduct or knowing or culpable violation of law; 
 any unlawful payments related to dividends, unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions, loans, guarantees or other distributions; or 
 any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 
 These limitations do not affect the availability of equitable remedies, including injunctive relief or rescission. As permitted by Delaware law, PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide that: 
 PMI will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law; 
 PMI may indemnify its other employees and other agents to the same extent that PMI indemnifies its officers and directors; and 
 PMI will advance expenses to its directors and officers in connection with a legal proceeding, and may advance expenses to any employee or agent; provided, however, that such advancement of expenses shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the person was not entitled to be indemnified. 
 The indemnification provisions contained in PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws are not exclusive. 
 In addition to the indemnification provided for in PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, PMI has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers. The indemnification agreements require PMI, among other things, to indemnify such persons for all expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by PMI) (collectively, Expenses ), actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the investigation, defense or appeal of any proceeding to which such person may be made a party, a potential party, a non-party witness, or otherwise by reason of: (i) such person s service as a director or officer of PMI; (ii) any action or inaction taken by such person or on such person s part while acting as director, officer, employee or agent of PMI; or (iii) such person s actions while serving at the request of PMI as a director, officer, employee, trustee, general partner, managing member, agent or fiduciary of PMI or any other entity, in each case, whether or not serving in any such capacity at the time any liability or expense is or was incurred. In addition, PMI is required to indemnify against any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any action establishing or enforcing a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under the indemnification agreement or under any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by PMI to the extent that such person is successful in such action. The indemnification agreements also provide that PMI agrees to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by law, even if such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of the agreement or PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Moreover, the indemnification agreements provide that any future changes under 
 74 

Delaware law that expand the ability of a Delaware corporation to indemnify its officers and directors are automatically incorporated into the agreements. 
 Under the indemnification agreements, PMI is not obligated to provide indemnification on account of any proceeding unless such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of PMI, and with respect to criminal proceedings, such person had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. The termination of a proceeding by judgment, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent does not, by itself, create the presumption that such person did not satisfy the above standards. In addition, under the indemnification agreements, PMI is not obligated to provide indemnification for: (i) any proceedings or claims initiated or brought voluntarily by such person and not by way of defense, unless such indemnification is authorized by PMI, other than a proceeding to establish such person s right to indemnification; (ii) any expenses incurred by such person with respect to any proceeding instituted by such person to enforce and interpret the terms of their indemnification agreement, unless such person is successful in such action; (iii) which payment has actually been made to or on behalf of such person under any statute, insurance policy, indemnity provision, vote or otherwise, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid; (iv) an accounting or disgorgement of profits pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, as amended, or similar provisions of federal, state or local statutory law or common law, if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements); and (v) any reimbursement of PMI by such person of any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation or of any profits realized by such person from the sale of securities of PMI, as required in each case under the Exchange Act, as amended (including any such reimbursements that arise from an accounting restatement of PMI pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the payment to PMI of profits arising from the purchase and sale by such person of securities in violation of Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), if such person is held liable therefor (including pursuant to any settlement arrangements). 
 PMI also maintains an insurance policy that covers certain liabilities of its directors and officers arising out of claims based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. 
 PMI believes that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. To the extent these provisions permit PMI to indemnify its officers and directors for liabilities arising under the Securities Act, however, PMI has been informed by the SEC that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 
 
 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 Prosper Marketplace, Inc. - Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 Overview 
 This section describes PMI's executive compensation objectives, compensation-setting process, executive compensation components and significant 2023 compensation decisions for PMI's named executive officers NEOs ). The compensation provided to PMI's NEOs for 2023 is set forth in detail in the Summary Compensation Table and other tables and the accompanying footnotes and narrative that follow this section. 
 PMI's named executive officers for 2023 are as follows: 
 David Kimball, our Chief Executive Officer; 
 Usama Ashraf, our President and Chief Financial Officer; 
 Pete Woodhouse, our Chief Technology Officer; 
 Edward R. Buell III, our General Counsel, Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer; and 
 Melinda Marchesi, our Chief Marketing Officer as of May 2023. 
 Executive Compensation Objectives 
 The objectives of PMI's executive compensation are to: 
 attract, retain and motivate senior leaders who are capable of advancing PMI's mission and strategy and ultimately, creating and maintaining its long-term equity value; 
 align the interests of PMI's executive officers with its stockholders long-term interests; and 
 reward executive officers for their contributions to PMI's overall performance as well as for their individual performance. 
 
 75 

Compensation-Setting Process 
 Role of Our Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing all aspects of our executive compensation program, including evaluating and approving executive salaries, annual bonus awards and the size and structure of equity awards for PMI's executive officers, including the NEOs. 
 Role of Management. In setting 2023 compensation, PMI's Chief Executive Officer worked closely with the Compensation Committee in making recommendations and attending Committee meetings. Because of his daily involvement with PMI's executive team, the Chief Executive Officer was involved in the determination of compensation for all of PMI's executive officers other than himself. The Compensation Committee also delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to make compensation decisions for senior management and executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President), subject to certain compensation limits set by the Compensation Committee. 
 Executive Compensation Components 
 PMI's executive compensation package includes: (1) base salary; (2) cash bonuses; and (3) long term incentives, generally in the form of cash and equity-based compensation, such as stock options and restricted stock units. PMI believes that this compensation mix supports its objective of attracting, motivating and retaining a talented and entrepreneurial executive team who will provide leadership for PMI s success in dynamic and competitive markets. PMI's compensation program is balanced among all three components in order to attract top talent and maximize retention, while ensuring that an appropriate portion of the executives compensation is tied to the Company's and its stockholders long-term interests. 
 Base Salary 
 Base salary is a fixed amount and is not tied to any metric relating to the performance of PMI's business as a whole. The base salary of each executive officer is initially established in the executive officer's offer letter and reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. In determining base salaries for 2023, PMI's Compensation Committee, together with the Chief Executive Officer, considered the individual executive officer's scope of responsibilities, contributions, prior salary level and position (in case of a promotion), and financial and market conditions. 
 The following table summarizes information regarding the base salaries for PMI's named executive officers for 2023: 2023 Base Salaries David Kimball 1 
 600,000 Usama Ashraf 2 
 488,000 Pete Woodhouse 3 
 415,000 Edward R. Buell III 4 
 365,000 Melinda Marchesi 5 
 365,000 
 1. In March 2023, PMI s Compensation Committee reviewed executive base salaries and decided to increase Mr. Kimball s annual base salary from 577,500 to 600,000. 
 2. In March 2023, PMI s Compensation Committee reviewed executive base salaries and decided to increase Mr. Ashraf s annual base salary from 469,350 to 488,000. 
 3. In March 2023, Mr. Woodhouse s base salary was increased from 384,375 to 415,000. 
 4. In March 2023, Mr. Buell s base salary was increased from 351,750 to 365,000. 
 5. In May 2023, Ms. Marchesi joined PMI as its Chief Marketing Officer, with an annual base salary of 365,000. 
 Cash Bonuses 
 PMI uses cash bonuses primarily to motivate and retain senior management leaders that are critical to advancing the Company's short-term and long-term strategic goals. In 2023, we based annual NEO bonuses on both the achievement of certain Board-approved financial, operational and strategic performance objectives as well as other factors. 
 In January 2024, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company s performance and progress towards the established 2023 objectives, and approved a bonus award of up to 40 of the annual target bonus amount for each NEO. 
 The amounts and terms of the bonuses awarded to each of our NEOs for 2023 are disclosed below, in the sections titled Summary Compensation Table and Narrative Discussion of the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. 

76 

Long-Term Incentives 
 Equity Compensation. PMI has used stock options and restricted stock units RSUs as the principal components of its executive long-term incentive equity compensation. Consistent with its compensation objectives, PMI believes this approach aligns the interests of its grantees with the long-term interests of PMI s stockholders. PMI believes that stock options and RSUs also serve as effective retention tools due to vesting requirements that are based on continued service with the company. In granting equity awards, PMI has customarily considered, among other things, the executive officers' cash compensation, the need to retain and motivate executive officers and to create a meaningful opportunity for reward predicated on the creation of long-term stockholder value, PMI's financial results, and each executive officer's individual contributions and responsibilities. The amounts and terms of the awards granted to each such NEO in 2023 are disclosed in the 2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table and accompanying footnotes to the table of Outstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year End. 
 Long-Term Cash Incentive Compensation. PMI s Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP is designed to reward our executives, including our named executive officers, for the achievement of strategic and operational objectives and the creation of long-term value. Under the LTCIP, eligible executive officers and vice presidents receive long-term cash incentive awards based on their performance during pre-established rolling two-year periods, the most recent of which ran from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023 (the 2022-2023 Performance Period ). Pa yments will be made by March 15, following the end of a performance period, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. The incentive targets range from 75 to 150 of the participant s base salary, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. PMI s executive officers and vice presidents are eligible to participate in the LTCIP if, as of March 15th of calendar year following the end of a performance period, they have been employed with PMI for at least three years, are currently full or part time employees of PMI, and are in good standing. PMI believes that the LTCIP will complement its annual equity awards by focusing its senior executives on specific long-term financial performance goals, while providing an opportunity for more immediate liquidity. In January 2024, the Compensation Committee considered the Company s performance and progress towards its established objectives during the 2022-2023 Performance Period, and approved a payout of up to 70 of the LTCIP incentive target amount for each NEO. The amounts of the LTCIP awards payable to eligible NEOs in connection with the 2022-2023 Performance Period are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
 Employment Agreements 
 PMI has entered into employment arrangements with each of its NEOs, which are comprised of an offer letter and an At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment and Arbitration Agreement. Each of these arrangements was approved or authorized on PMI s behalf by the Compensation Committee or, in certain instances, its Board of Directors. 
 Each of the offer letters provides for at-will employment and sets forth the initial compensation arrangements for the NEO, generally including an initial base salary, an annual cash bonus opportunity, and an equity award. Certain of the offer letters provide for payments or an acceleration of the executive s equity award grant upon termination of their employment in specified situations, including following a change in control. These arrangements (including potential payments and terms) are discussed in more detail in the Narrative Discussion of the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and the Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change In Control of PMI sections and related tables below. 
 Other Compensation Information 
 Benefits Programs 
 PMI s employee benefit programs, including its 401(k) plan, health and welfare programs, and incentive programs, including the Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option Plan, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan, are designed to provide a competitive level of benefits to PMI s employees generally, including its named executive officers and their families. 
 PMI s 401(k) plan covers all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. The 401(k) plan is designed to provide tax-deferred retirement benefits in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees are allowed to contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation to the 401(k) plan, up to the annual maximum as determined by the Internal Revenue Service, and PMI may make discretionary matching contributions of a portion of the employees eligible wage deferrals, subject to certain limitations and conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2023, PMI contributed 3.0 million to the 401(k) plan. The amount of PMI s matching contributions for each of our NEOs is set forth in footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table below. On January 1, 2024, PMI temporarily suspended its discretionary matching contributions, which PMI may reinstate in the future upon the Company meeting certain business objectives. 
 
 All full-time employees, including PMI s named executive officers, may participate in its health and welfare benefit programs, including medical, dental and vision care coverage, disability insurance and life insurance. 
 77 

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
 Currently, PMI does not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of its compensation. Accordingly, PMI does not generally provide perquisites, such as company cars and paid parking spaces, to its executive officers. PMI does reimburse its executive officers for certain relocation expenses, subject to the terms and conditions prescribed by the Compensation Committee. 
 In the future, PMI may provide additional perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as where PMI believes it is appropriate to assist an individual executive in the performance of their duties and for recruitment, motivation or retention purposes. 
 Post-Employment Compensation 
 The Compensation Committee recognizes that a possible, threatened, or pending change of control transaction could result in the departure or distraction of PMI s senior executives. To establish a meaningful financial incentive for PMI s senior executive officers to work diligently through and beyond a proposed transaction that may involve a change in control of the company, certain of the stock options and restricted stock units granted to PMI s NEOs will fully vest upon a change in control of PMI, while others will fully vest in the event that, within 12 months after a change in control of PMI, such officer is subject to a termination of employment without cause or resigns for good reason (each as defined in the applicable option agreement). 
 In addition, PMI entered into severance and change in control agreements (the severance agreements with each of Messrs. Kimball and Ashraf in November 2020 and with Mr. Woodhouse in February 2022, the terms and conditions of which restate and replace any severance arrangements set forth in their respective offer letters. Under the severance agreements, each of Messrs. Kimball, Ashraf, and Woodhouse, would be entitled to the following in the event that such officer s employment is terminated by PMI without cause or by the applicable officer for good reason (each as defined in the severance agreement) and the officer meets certain tenure requirements as of the date of such termination: (i) a lump sum severance payment equal to one year base salary; (ii) any unpaid annual bonus and long-term cash incentive award for the year(s) preceding the year of termination; (iii) continued coverage for the participants and eligible dependents pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA ), for 12 months, unless such coverage is earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the severance agreement; (iv) a pro-rated annual bonus payment for the year of termination; and (v) with respect to any long-term performance period under the LTCIP that commenced more than one year prior to the executive s termination date, a pro-rated long-term cash incentive payment for the performance period in which the termination occurs. In the event that Messrs. Kimball, Ashraf, or Woodhouse, is terminated by PMI or its successor without cause or by the applicable officer for good reason and such termination occurs within 24 months following a change in control of PMI, then, subject to certain tenure requirements, such officer would be entitled to receive the severance set forth in items (i) through (iii) above, as well as such officer s (x) target annual bonus for the year of termination; and (y) their target long-term cash incentive payment for the year of termination. Receipt of these severance benefits is conditioned on the officer s signing a release of claims in favor of PMI. 
 PMI also entered into a severance agreement with Ms. Marchesi in March 2023 which contained the same terms and conditions as the severance agreements signed by Messrs. Kimball, Ashraf, and Woodhouse, provided that under the terms of Ms. Marchesi s severance agreement, until certain tenure requirements were met, Ms. Marchesi would only be entitled to a lump sum severance payment equal to six months base salary in the event that her employment was terminated by PMI without cause or by her for good reason prior to the one year anniversary of her employment start date. 
 For additional information regarding these severance and change in control arrangements, see Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control of PMI below. 
 Compensation Risk Assessment 
 PMI's management evaluates and mitigates any risk that may exist relating to its compensation plans, practices and policies for all employees, including PMI's NEOs. PMI's management has concluded that PMI's compensation policies and practices do not create or promote inappropriate or excessive risk taking.

 CEO Pay Ratio 
 In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, PMI is providing the following information for the year ended December 31, 2023: 
 The median of total compensation of all employees, excluding our CEO: 140,712; 
 The annual total compensation of our CEO: 1,452,813; and 
 The ratio of CEO total compensation to median employee total compensation: 10.32 to 1. 
 Our CEO pay ratio information is a reasonable good faith estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC pay ratio rules and methods for disclosure. In order to determine the median employee from a compensation perspective, PMI examined cash compensation (salary, wages and cash bonuses) paid for the 2023 calendar year for all employees, excluding our CEO, employed as of December 31, 2023 (the Determination Date ). On the Determination Date, Prosper s employee population consisted of 404 individuals, all of whom were located in the United States. This population consisted of our full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. We did not include any contractors or workers employed through a third-party provider in our employee population. 
 To identify the median employee, we utilized the amount of annualized earnings, wages and cash bonus our employees received, as reflected in our payroll records through the Determination Date and annualized such amounts for any individual hired during 2023. Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee s compensation for 2023 to determine the median employee total compensation in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K and compared such total compensation to the total compensation of PMI s CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table.

 Equity Incentive Plans 
 PMI grants equity awards primarily through its 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which was approved by PMI's Board of Directors on April 7, 2015 and subsequently amended by an Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, and Amendment No. 3, which were approved by PMI's Board of Directors on February 15, 2016, May 19, 2016, and January 23, 2018, respectively (as amended, the 2015 Plan ). PMI also previously granted equity awards through its Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option Plan (the 2005 Plan ), which was approved as amended and restated by its stockholders on December 1, 2010, and expired in March 2015. The 2005 Plan and 2015 Plan are collectively referred to in this Annual Report as the Equity Plans. 
 Any awards granted under the 2005 Plan prior to its expiration remain in effect pursuant to their terms. Unless sooner terminated by PMI s Board of Directors, the 2015 Plan will expire ten years from the date of its adoption. All stock options granted to NEOs are incentive stock options, to the extent permissible under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. All equity awards to PMI s employees and directors were granted at no less than the fair market value of its common stock on the date of each award. In the absence of a public trading market for PMI common stock, PMI s Board of Directors, acting on its own or through the Compensation Committee, has determined the fair market value of its common stock in good faith based upon consideration of a number of relevant factors including the status of its development efforts, financial status and market conditions. See Item 15, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 81 

The 2005 Plan provided for grants in the form of non-qualified stock options and stock purchase rights, which were available for grant to PMI s directors, consultants or employees, including officers, and incentive stock options, which were available for grant solely to its employees, including officers. The 2015 Plan provides for grants in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and unrestricted stock. Under the 2015 Plan, incentive stock options may be granted solely to PMI s employees, including officers. Awards other than incentive stock options may be granted to its directors, consultants or employees, including officers. The Equity Plans are administered by PMI s Board of Directors, which in turn has delegated authority to administer the plans to the Compensation Committee. 
 Shares of PMI s common stock subject to options that have expired or otherwise terminate under the 2015 Plan or the 2005 Plan without having been exercised in full will become available for grant under the 2015 Plan. Shares of PMI s common stock issued under the 2015 Plan may include previously unissued shares or reacquired shares bought on the market or otherwise. 
 As of December 31, 2023, an aggregate of 92,084,513 options to purchase our common stock were outstanding or authorized for issuance under the Equity Plans. Of these outstanding and authorized options, a total of 82,113,271 options and 2,574,633 restricted stock units were outstanding under the Equity Plans and 7,396,609 equity awards were available for grant under the 2015 Plan. No equity awards are available for grant under the 2005 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2023, an aggregate of 4,063,543 options and 27,750 RSUs granted under the Equity Plans either expired or were forfeited. As of December 31, 2023, 60,741,572 options under the Equity Plans were vested and outstanding and 54,659,109 were exercised. 
 
 The NEOs identified herein have been granted equity awards upon employment with PMI, for merit increases, and for retention purposes.

 ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 
 Prosper Marketplace, Inc. 
 The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of PMI s Common Stock as of March 1, 2024, by: 
 each of PMI s directors; 
 each of PMI s named executive officers; 
 each person, or group of affiliated persons, who is known by PMI to beneficially own more than 5 of PMI s Common Stock; and 
 all of PMI s directors and executive officers as a group. 
 Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. Except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table below, all of the shares reflected in the table are shares of Common Stock and all persons listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws. The information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. 
 Percentage ownership calculations are based on 277,790,279 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 1, 2024, assuming the conversion of all of PMI s convertible preferred stock, but excluding any outstanding stock options or warrants. Each share of PMI preferred stock is convertible at any time at the discretion of the holder. Shares of PMI s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock convert into shares of PMI Common Stock at a ratio of 1 to 1. Shares of PMI s Series A-1 Preferred Stock convert into shares of PMI Common Stock at a ratio of 1,000,000 to 1. Shares of PMI s Series G Preferred Stock convert into shares of PMI common stock at a ratio of 1 to 1.36. 
 In computing the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by a person or entity and the percentage ownership of that person or entity, PMI deemed outstanding all shares of Common Stock subject to options and warrants held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or vesting within 60 days of March 1, 2024. PMI did not deem these 
 86 

shares outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership representing less than 1.0 is denoted with an asterisk ). Except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table below, addresses of named beneficial owners and officers are in care of Prosper Marketplace, Inc., 221 Main Street, 3 rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
 Prosper Marketplace, Inc. 
 Agreements with PFL 
 On January 22, 2013, PMI entered into an Administration Agreement with PFL (as amended to date, the PMI Administration Agreement ), pursuant to which PMI agreed to provide certain administrative services relating to the marketplace. Under the PMI Administration Agreement, PFL is required to pay PMI (a) an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the specified annual Corporate Administration Fees equal to 50 of finance and legal personnel costs, (b) a fee for each Borrower Loan originated through the marketplace, (c) 90 of all Servicing Fees collected by or on behalf of Prosper Funding, and (d) all nonsufficient funds fees collected by or on behalf of PFL. As of the most recent amendment of the PMI Administration Agreement, PFL is required to pay PMI (a) Corporate Administration Fees of 500 thousand per month, (b) a fee for each Borrower Loan originated through the marketplace, (c) 62.5 of all Servicing Fees collected by or on behalf of Prosper Funding, and (d) all nonsufficient funds fees collected by or on behalf of Prosper Funding. 
 Also on January 22, 2013, PFL and PMI entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement (the Asset Transfer Agreement pursuant to which PMI, effective February 1, 2013 (i) transferred the marketplace and substantially all of PMI s assets and rights related to the operation of the marketplace to PFL, and (ii) made a capital contribution to PFL in excess of 3 million. Under the Asset Transfer Agreement, PMI also transferred substantially all of its remaining assets to PFL, including (i) all outstanding Notes issued by PMI under the Indenture dated June 15, 2009 between PMI and Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee (the Indenture ), (ii) all Borrower Loans corresponding to such Notes, (iii) all registration agreements related to such Notes and Borrower Loans, and (iv) all documents and information related to the foregoing. Certain hardware and agreements relevant to the development, maintenance and use of the marketplace, including in relation to the origination, funding and servicing of Borrower Loans, and the issuance, funding and payment of the Notes, were not transferred or assigned to PFL by PMI. In addition, PMI did not transfer to PFL (i) agreements with PMI s directors, officers or employees and PMI s financial, legal or other advisors or consultants, (ii) certain agreements with vendors to provide PMI with goods or services in the ordinary course of business (including software licensed pursuant to any shrink wrap or click wrap license), and (iii) certain cash and short-term investments. 
 
 89 

In the Asset Transfer Agreement, PMI agreed, among other things, to: 
 i. fund any repurchase obligation with respect to the transferred Notes, and indemnify PFL for any other losses that arise out of any registration agreement related to the transferred Notes or Borrower Loans, including as a result of a breach by PMI of any of its representations or warranties made therein; 
 ii. fund any arbitration filing or administrative fees or arbitrator fees payable under any registration agreement related to the transferred Notes or Borrower Loans; and 
 iii. fund any indemnification obligations that arise under any registration agreement entered into by PMI prior to the date of the asset transfer. 
 On August 17, 2021, PMI and PFL entered into an Asset Transfer and License Agreement (the IP Asset Transfer and License Agreement ). The IP Asset Transfer and License Agreement, among other things, (i) transfers, assigns, and conveys certain intellectual property assets related to PMI s white label service and PMI s Credit Card product from PMI to PFL, and (ii) grants certain licenses and sublicenses related to the transferred intellectual property assets from PFL to PMI. PMI also agreed to make certain intellectual property filings to provide third parties with notice of the conveyance and to assist PFL with any additional intellectual property filings as may be required. PMI received a one-time fee of 10 from PFL in connection with the foregoing. 
 The foregoing description of the IP Asset Transfer and License Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the IP Asset Transfer and License Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Holders of the transferred Notes are third party beneficiaries under the Asset Transfer Agreement and the Administration Agreement. 
 Under Section 4.1 of the Indenture, PMI could transfer substantially all of its assets to any person without the consent of the holders of the existing Notes, provided that the transferee expressly assumed all of PMI s obligations under the Indenture and the existing Notes. In that case, the transferee would succeed to and be substituted for PMI, and PMI would be discharged from all of its obligations and covenants, under the Indenture and the existing Notes. Accordingly, on January 22, 2013, PMI, PFL and Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee entered an Amended and Restated Indenture (the Amended and Restated Indenture ), effective February 1, 2013, which (i) effected such assumption, substitution and discharge (the Note Assumption ), and (ii) amended and restated the Indenture to reflect the Note Assumption and to make certain other amendments to the Indenture as permitted therein. Following the Note Assumption, PFL became the obligor with respect to the transferred Notes and the Amended and Restated Indenture, and PMI no longer has any obligations with respect thereto. 
 Agreements with Significant Shareholders 
 On February 27, 2017, PF L entered into a Loan Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with PF LoanCo Funding LLC, a Cayman limited liability company (the Beneficiary ), and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, not in its individual capacity but solely in its capacity as trustee of PF LoanCo Trust, a New York common law trust (the Trust ). The Purchase Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which PFL will sell eligible personal loans in an aggregate amount of up to 5.0 billion to the Purchaser for the benefit of the Beneficiary. An aggregate of 3.3 billion of loans were purchased under the Purchase Agreement, which does not include 0.3 billion of Whole Loan purchases by members of the Consortium prior to the signing of the Purchase Agreement. The Consortium Purchase Agreement ended in May 2019. 
 In connection with the Purchase Agreement, on February 27, 2017, PMI entered into a Warrant Agreement with PF WarrantCo Holdings, LP PF WarrantCo ), a Delaware limited partnership and an entity related to the Beneficiary, and, for certain limited purposes, New Residential Investment Corp. (the Series F Warrant Agreement ). Pursuant to the Series F Warrant Agreement, PMI issued to PF WarrantCo three warrant certificates to purchase up to in aggregate 177,720,706 shares of PMI s Series F Preferred Stock at an exercise price of 0.01 per share (the Warrant Shares ). 
 During the term of the Consortium Purchase Agreement, PF WarrantCo was a beneficial owner of more than 5 of PMI s Common Stock as a result of the Warrant Shares vesting. The Beneficiary is an affiliate under common control with PF WarrantCo. 
 Certain Relationships Among Directors and Officers 
 None.

The Code also requires directors and executive officers to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest to PMI s Chief Compliance Officer, who will report such conflicts to PMI s Audit Committee for review. 
 PMI s directors and executive officers are required each year to respond to a questionnaire regarding their independence. The questionnaire also requires each director and executive officer to identify if they or an immediate family member have been indebted to, or have been a participant in any material transactions with, PMI or any of its subsidiaries.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Prosper Marketplace Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Prosper Marketplace Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, convertible preferred stock and stockholders deficit, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Valuation of Level 3 Financial Instruments and Unobservable Inputs Therein 
 
 Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value See Note 4. Borrow Loans, Loans Held for Sale and Notes, at Fair Value 
 Servicing Assets See Note 6. Servicing Assets 
 Credit Card Servicing Obligation Liability See Note 5. Credit Card 
 Credit Card Derivative See Note 5. Credit Card 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company measures financial instruments at fair value including borrower loans and loans held for sale, servicing assets, credit card servicing obligation and credit card derivative. As of December 31, 2023, borrower loans were 545.0 million, loans held for sale were 161.5 million, personal loans servicing assets were 12.2 million, credit card derivative was 36.8 million and credit card servicing obligation liability was 9.7 million, which is recorded within other liabilities. The Company estimates the fair values using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies incorporating significant unobservable inputs and valuation assumptions that are reflective of management s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the 
 F-1 

instruments and requires significant management judgement or estimate. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation methodology of the servicing assets and credit card serving obligation include the market servicing rate. For all level 3 financial instruments, significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation methodology include discount rates, default rates and prepayment rates. 
 
 Auditing the methodology and significant unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair values of these level 3 financial instruments required a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of these Level 3 financial instruments and unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value included the following key procedures: 
 
 We gained an understanding of the significance of inputs and assumptions using sensitivity analysis, identifying relevant inputs and assumptions for further testing. 
 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent estimates of fair value and compared our estimates to the Company s estimates. 
 
 We tested the source information derived from the Company s data used in the valuation models. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the market servicing rate assumption used in developing the fair value estimate of the servicing assets. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the market servicing rate assumption used in developing the fair value estimate of the credit card servicing obligation liability. 
 
 Valuation of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the Financial Statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Convertible preferred stock warrants are recorded at fair value and subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2023, convertible preferred stock warrant liability was 215.0 million. To estimate the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants, the Company determines the equity value of the Company using a variety of valuation methods, including recent transactions in the Company's stock, discounted cash flow models and market based methods, as deemed appropriate under the circumstances applicable at the valuation date. Once the equity value has been estimated, an option pricing model is used to allocate the value to the various classes of equity, including preferred stock. The concluded per share value for the convertible preferred stock warrants is then determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 
 Auditing the valuation methods used by management to estimate the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability required a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability included the following key procedures, among others: 
 
 We performed inquiries with management and the Company s third-party valuation expert to understand the process for developing, and assumptions used in, the valuation model. 
 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists we evaluated the Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant valuation methodology, assumptions, and fair value results. 
 
 We evaluated whether management s assumptions were reasonable including comparing management s historical forecasts of future cash flows to actual results.

 of a Borrower Loan directly from Prosper. As of December 31, 2023, the marketplace is open to investors in states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the marketplace is open to borrowers in states and the District of Columbia. Currently our marketplace does not operate internationally. 
 In December 2021, the Company launched its Prosper Credit Card product in partnership with Coastal Community Bank Coastal ), through which eligible consumers are extended unsecured credit through Prosper-branded Credit Cards. In accordance with our program agreement with Coastal, the receivables associated with these Credit Cards are maintained on the balance sheet of Coastal. Customer accounts are then randomly designated as either Prosper Allocations or Coastal Allocations on an approximate 90 to 10 split, respectively. Each party receives 100 of the interest income and is responsible for the credit losses on its allocated customer accounts. PMI is responsible for verified fraud losses across the entire portfolio and a portion of straight charge-off losses. Credit Card receivables are not available on the Company s personal loan marketplace for investment purposes.

of the outstanding balance. The fair value election for Notes and Borrower Loans allows both the assets and the related liabilities to receive similar accounting treatment for expected losses which is consistent with the subsequent cash flows to investors that are dependent upon borrower payments. As such, the fair value of a series of Notes is approximately equal to the fair value of the corresponding Borrower Loan, adjusted for the servicing fee and the timing of loan purchase, Note issuance and borrower payments. As a result, the valuation of the Notes uses the same methodology and assumptions as the Borrower Loans, except that the Notes incorporate the servicing fee and any differences in timing in payments. The effective interest rate associated with a group of Notes is less than the interest rate earned on the corresponding Borrower Loan due to the servicing fee.

 The costs to develop software for the website and other internal uses are capitalized when management has authorized and committed project funding, when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, and when it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software and website development costs primarily include software licenses acquired, fees paid to outside consultants and salaries and payroll-related costs for employees directly involved in the development efforts. 
 Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed. Costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements that are considered to be probable to result in additional functionality are capitalized. Capitalized costs are included in Property and Equipment and amortized to expense using the straight-line method over their expected lives.

Prosper records the transaction fee net of any fees paid to WebBank because Prosper does not receive an identifiable benefit from WebBank other than the borrower loan that has been recognized at fair value. Additionally, the Company assumes WebBank s obligation under Utah law to refund the pro-rated amount of the transaction fee in excess of 5 in the event of a borrower prepayment of the loan in full before maturity. Actual and expected refunds are recorded as a reduction of Transaction Fees, Net on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations, and are included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets (Note 17).

pe r annum of the outstanding principal balance of the borrower loan prior to applying the current payment, plus an additional per annum to cover the Loan Trailing Fee. The servicing fee compensates Prosper for the costs incurred in servicing the borrower loan, including managing payments from borrowers, managing payments to investors and maintaining investors account portfolios. Prosper records Servicing Fees from investors as a component of operating revenue when received. 
 Under the Credit Card program agreement, Prosper is responsible for servicing the entire underlying Credit Card portfolio. Coastal pays the Company a per annum servicing fee on the daily outstanding balance of receivables designated as Coastal Allocations. To the extent these servicing fees do not exceed the market servicing rate a market participant would require to service the entire Credit Card portfolio, the Company records a servicing obligation liability and measures it at fair value throughout the servicing period. Changes in the fair value of the servicing obligation liability are recorded in Servicing Fees. 
 (Loss) Gain on Sale of Borrower Loans 
 Prosper recognizes gains or losses on the sale of Borrower Loans when it sells Borrower Loans to third parties. Prosper measures gain or loss on sale of Borrower Loans as the net proceeds received on a sale less the fair value of the Borrower Loans sold. The net proceeds of the sale represent the fair value of any assets obtained or liabilities incurred as part of the transaction, including, but not limited to Servicing Assets, retained securities, repurchase obligations and any incentives provided or received at the time of sale. 
 Interest Income on Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale and Interest Expense on Financial Instruments 
 Prosper recognizes interest income on Borrower Loans and Loans Held for Sale using the accrual method based on the stated interest rate to the extent we believe it to be collectible. We record interest expense on the corresponding Notes, at Fair Value, Notes Issued by Securitization Trust and Warehouse Lines based on the contractual interest rates. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other Revenues consist primarily of credit referral fees. These fees are earned from partner companies for the referral of customers on the Company s platform. The transaction price is a fixed amount per referral and is recognized by the Company upon a successful referral. Other revenues also include incentive fees earned from partner companies through established incentive programs and miscellaneous net fees related to the Company s Credit Card program. 
 As of December 31, 2023, Prosper had no contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs. As of December 31, 2023, Prosper had no unsatisfied performance obligations related to Transaction Fees or Other Revenues. 
 Prosper incurred advertising costs of million , million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Fair Value Valuation Method 
 Prosper uses a discounted cash flow valuation methodology generally consisting of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of a financial instrument and then discounts those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. 
 Significant unobservable inputs presented in the table within Note 8 below are those that Prosper considers significant to the estimated fair values of the Level 3 Servicing Assets. The following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
 Market Servicing Rate 
 Prosper estimates adequate market servicing rates that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required, which includes the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace. This rate is stated as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance on a per annum basis. With the assistance of a valuation specialist, Prosper estimates these market servicing rates based on observable market rates for other loan types in the industry and bids from subservicing providers, adjusted for the unique loan attributes that are present in the specific loans that Prosper sells and services and information from backup service providers. 
 Discount Rate 
 The discount rate is a rate of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value of the loan servicing rights. We use a range of discount rates for the Servicing Assets based on comparable observed valuations of similar assets and publicly available disclosures related to servicing valuations, with comparability adjustments made to account for differences with Prosper s servicing assets. 
 Default Rate 
 The default rate presented in Note 8 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e., risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional default rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to default per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans. The assumption regarding defaults directly reduces servicing revenues because the amount of servicing revenues received is based on the amount collected each period. 
 Prepayment Rate 
 The prepayment rate presented in Note 8 is an annualized, average estimate considering all Borrower Loan categories (i.e., risk ratings and duration), and represents an aggregate of conditional prepayment rate curves for each credit grade or Borrower Loan category. Each point on a particular Borrower Loan category s curve represents the percentage of principal expected to prepay per period based on the term and age of the underlying Borrower Loans. Prepayments reduce servicing revenues as they shorten the period over which we expect to collect fees on the Borrower Loans, which is used to project future servicing revenues.

NOTE 7. 
 million as of the established cutoff date of August 31, 2023, to the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction. On September 25, 2023, these Borrower Loans with an updated aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately million were contributed to the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction. PMIT 2023-1 issued notes and residual certificates to finance the purchase of the Borrower Loans. The notes were sold to third-party investors, and the residual certificates were acquired by PMI, as a majority-owned affiliate of the sole sponsor of the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction, PFL. In addition to the residual certificates, Prosper s continued involvement includes loan servicing responsibilities over the life of the underlying loans. 
 PMIT 2023-1 is deemed a VIE, and the Company consolidates it as the primary beneficiary. Through Prosper s role as the servicer, it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction s economic performance. Additionally, because the Company holds the residual certificates, it has a variable interest that could potentially be significant to PMIT 2023-1. In evaluating whether Prosper is the primary beneficiary, management considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with PMIT 2023-1. Management assesses whether Prosper is the primary beneficiary of the VIE on an on-going basis. For PMIT 2023-1, the creditors have no recourse to the general credit of Prosper and the liabilities of the securitization trust can only be settled by PMIT 2023-1 s assets. Additionally, the assets of PMIT 2023-1 can be used only to settle obligations of PMIT 2023-1. Because Prosper consolidates the securitization trust, the Borrower Loans held in the securitization trust are included in Borrower Loans, at Fair Value, and the notes sold to third-party investors are presented in Notes Issued by Securitization Trust on the consolidated balance sheets. Because Prosper holds 100 of the residual certificates issued by PMIT 2023-1, they eliminate through consolidation and are thus not presented on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 The notes under PMIT 2023-1 were issued in classes: Class A in the amount of million, Class B in the amount of million, Class C in the amount of million, Class D in the amount of million and Class E in the amount of million (collectively, the 2023-1 Notes ). The Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D and Class E notes bear interest at fixed rates of , , , and , respectively. Principal and interest payments began in October 2023 and are payable monthly. These notes are recorded at amortized cost, net of original issue discounts totaling approximately million. These discounts, along with debt issuance costs incurred of million, are deferred and amortized into interest expense over the contractual lives of the notes using the effective interest method. The notes held by third-party investors, along with unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs, are aggregated and presented as Notes Issued by Securitization Trust on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal and accrued interest of these notes was million , secured by an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million of borrower loans included in Borrower Loans, at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and approximately million in cash collections held in collateral and reserve accounts included in Restricted Cash on the consolidated balance sheets.

 As PMI s Borrower Loans, Loans Held for Sale, Notes, Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability, Servicing Assets and Liability, Credit Card Derivative and loan trailing fee liability do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the Level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Prosper did not transfer any assets or liabilities in or out of Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

 In conjunction with the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction (see Note 7, Securitizations ), the entire portfolio of Borrower Loans held in the PWIIT Warehouse Line, with an unpaid principal balance of million as of September 25, 2023, was transferred to either the PMIT 2023-1 Transaction or PFL, as follows: million of those Borrower Loans were contributed into the securitization trust through a depositor, and the remaining million consisted of loans ineligible for securitization and were transferred to PFL. Proceeds from the sale of these loans were used to pay down the outstanding principal and interest on the PWIIT Warehouse Line of million, and the PWIIT Warehouse line was terminated at that time. Remaining proceeds after transaction expenses were transferred to PMI. As a result of the termination of the PWIIT Warehouse Line, deferred and unamortized debt issuance costs of million were immediately amortized into interest expense.

The Series A-1 convertible preferred shares have no dividend rights. To date, no dividends have been declared on any of PMI s preferred stock or Common Stock. 
 Conversion 
 Under the terms of PMI s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the holders of preferred stock have the right to convert such preferred stock into Common Stock at any time. In addition, all preferred stock automatically converts into Common Stock (x) immediately prior to the closing of an initial public offering that values Prosper at least at billion and that results in aggregate proceeds to Prosper of at least million or (y) upon a written request from the holders of at least of the voting power of the outstanding preferred stock (on an as-converted basis, provided that: (i) the Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock; (ii) the Series D shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series D; (iii) the Series E-1 and Series E-2 shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series E-1 and Series E-2, voting together as a single class; (iv) the Series F shall not be converted without at least of the voting power of the outstanding Series F, and (v) the shares of Series G Preferred Stock will not be automatically converted unless the holders of at least of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock approve such conversion). In addition, if a holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has converted any of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, then all of such holder s shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock also will be converted upon a liquidation event (as defined under the certificate of incorporation). In lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock to which a holder would otherwise be entitled, PMI shall pay such holder cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such fractional shares, as determined by its Board of Directors. At present, each of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E-1, Series E-2, and Series F Convertible Preferred Stock converts into PMI Common Stock at a :1 ratio. The Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock converts into Common Stock at a :1 ratio and the Series G Convertible Preferred Stock converts into Common Stock at a 1: ratio. The Series G Convertible Preferred Stock conversion ratio reflects the Series G true-up that occurred at end of the vesting period for the Series E-2 and Series F Preferred Stock warrants. 
 For the Series G true-up, the conversion price of the Series G Convertible Preferred Stock was reduced to a number equal to the Series G Preferred Stock original issuance price, divided by the quotient obtained by dividing the Series G true-up amount by the total number of Series G Preferred Stock issued as of the Series G closing date. The Series G true-up amount means the aggregate number of shares of Series G Preferred Stock that would have been issued to the purchasers of the Series G Preferred Stock on the Series G closing date, if warrants to purchase shares of Series E-2 Preferred Stock or Series F Preferred

The income or expense resulted from remeasurement of th e fair value of the warrants is recorded in Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 To determine the fair value of the Series E-1 Warrants, the Company first determined the value of a share of a Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock. To determine the fair value of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company first derived the business enterprise value BEV of the Company using a variety of valuation methods, including discounted cash flow models and market based methods, as deemed appropriate under the circumstances applicable at the valuation date. Once the Company determined an estimated BEV, the option pricing method OPM was used to allocate the BEV to the various classes of our equity, including our preferred stock. The concluded per share value for the Series E-1 Convertible Preferred Stock was utilized as an input to the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 Risk-free interest rate Expected term (in years) Dividend yield 
 The above assumptions were determined as follows: 
 Volatility: The volatility is derived from historical volatilities of several unrelated publicly listed peer companies over a period approximately equal to the term of the warrant as the Company has limited information on the volatility of its preferred stock since there is currently no trading history. When making the selections of industry peer companies to be used in the volatility calculation, the Company considered the size, operational, and economic similarities to the Company s principal business operations. 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect as of December 31, 2023, and for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the term of the warrant. 
 Expected Term: The expected term is the period of time for which the warrants are expected to be outstanding. 
 Dividend Yield: The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s current expectations about the Company s anticipated dividend policy. 
 Series F Warrants 
 In connection with the Consortium Purchase Agreement on February 27, 2017 , PMI issued warrants to purchase up to shares of PMI's Series F Convertible Preferred Stock at per share. The warrants expire from the date of issuance. Prosper recognize d million of expense a nd million of income from the re-measurement of the fair value of the warrants for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The income or expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the warrant is recorded through Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 To determine the fair value of the Series F Warrants, the Company first determined the value of a share of a Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. To determine the fair value of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company first derived the BEV using valuation methods, including a combination of methods, as deemed appropriate under the circumstances applicable at the valuation date. Once the Company determined an estimated BEV, the OPM was used to allocate the BEV to the various classes of Prosper's equity, including our preferred stock. The concluded per share value for the Series F Convertible Preferred Stock warrants utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

 The combined activity of the Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented in Note 8, Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities. Starting with the Series E and F Warrant valuations prepared as of September 30, 2023, due to a change in methodology, the Company removed the discount for lack of marketability that was previously applied to the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation. This change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase to the Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability and the Change in Fair Value of Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants of approximately million as of December 31, 2023 and for the year then ended. 
 Common Stock 
 PMI, through its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, is the sole issuer of Common Stock and related options, RSUs and warrants. On February 16, 2016, PMI amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to, among other things, effect a -for-1 forward stock split. On September 20, 2017, PMI further amended its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance. The total number of shares of stock which PMI has the authority to issue is , consisting of shares of Common Stock, par value per share, and shares of preferred stock, par value per share. As described above, the Company repurchased shares of Common Stock on December 23, 2019. As of December 31, 2023, shares of Common Stock were issued and shares of Common Stock were outstanding.

Other Information Regarding Stock Options 
 The fair value of options granted to employees is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires PMI to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the fair value of PMI s Common Stock, the expected term (the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the volatility of PMI s Common Stock, a risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Given the absence of a publicly traded market, the Company considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of PMI s Common Stock at each grant date. These factors included, but were not limited to: (i) contemporaneous valuations of Common Stock performed by unrelated third-party specialists, (ii) the prices for PMI s preferred stock sold to outside investors, (iii) the rights, preferences and privileges of PMI s preferred stock relative to PMI s Common Stock; (iv) the lack of marketability of PMI s Common Stock, (v) developments in the business, (vi) secondary transactions of PMI s common and preferred shares, and (vii) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of Prosper, given prevailing market conditions. As PMI s stock is not publicly traded, volatility for stock options is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the Common Stock of several entities with characteristics similar to those of PMI. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options using the simplified method. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. PMI uses an expected dividend yield of as it does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 PMI also estimates forfeitures of unvested stock options. Expected forfeitures are based on the Company s historical experience. To the extent actual forfeitures differ from the estimates, the difference will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. compensation cost is recorded for options that do not vest.

 Under ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , a valuation allowance must be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The amount of valuation allowance is based upon management s best estimate of Prosper s ability to realize the net deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance can subsequently be reduced when management believes that the assets are realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. As of December 31, 2023, the Company continues to record a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, increased by million to million from the prior year. 
 The Internal Revenue Code imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. Accordingly, Prosper s ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited in the future as the result of such an ownership change. 
 Prosper files federal and various state income tax returns, and has net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for both federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, before any potential limitations for ownership changes. The state net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related to California. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 and 2024, respectively. All net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a full valuation allowance. Prosper has federal and California research and development tax credits of approximately million and million, respectively. The federal research credits will begin to expire in 2034 and the California research credits have no expiration date.

Rental expense under operating lease arrangements was million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 The Company identified certain impairment triggers related to its ROU assets in 2023, primarily due to the vacancy of a portion of the Company s leased office space and the time expected to find a new subtenant. As a result of impairment testing performed on these ROU assets, the Company recorded an impairment charge of thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023. impairment charge was identified for the years ended 2022 and 2021 . 
 In May 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to its San Francisco office lease, the most prominent impact of which was to extend the lease term for the Company s primary space in that office for an additional period through May 2028.

, in the event the underlying borrower prepays the loan before full maturity. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has accrued million related to anticipated future refunds under this obligation. 
 Loan Purchase Commitments 
 Prosper entered into an agreement with WebBank to purchase million of Borrower Loans that WebBank originated during the last two business days of the year ended December 31, 2023. Prosper will purchase these Borrower Loans within the first two business days of the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 Repurchase Obligation 
 Under the terms of the loan purchase agreements between Prosper and investors that participate in the Whole Loan Channel, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to repurchase a Borrower Loan from an investor. Generally, these circumstances include the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, the failure to properly follow personal loan listing or bidding protocols or a violation of the applicable federal, state or local lending laws. Prosper recognizes a liability at fair value for the repurchase obligation when the Borrower Loans are sold. The fair value of the repurchase obligation is estimated based on historical experience. Repurchased Borrower Loans associated with violations of federal, state or local lending laws or verifiable identity theft are written off at the time of repurchase. The maximum potential amount of future payments associated with this obligation is the outstanding balances of the Borrower Loans issued to third parties through the Whole Loan Channel, which at December 31, 2023 is billion . Prosper has accrued million and million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in regard to this obligation. 
 Under the terms of the indenture and investor registration agreement, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to either repurchase a Note or indemnify the investor for any losses resulting from nonpayment of a Note purchased in the Retail Channel. The decision to repurchase or indemnify is in Prosper s sole discretion. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, a technical error in the automated bidding tools which results in the purchase of a Note that does not match the investor s investment criteria, or situations in which a personal loan listing includes a Prosper Rating that is different from the Prosper Rating that should have appeared in the listing for the corresponding Borrower Loan because either PFL inaccurately input data into, or inaccurately applied, the formula for determining the Prosper Rating and, as a result, the interest of the investor is materially and adversely affected. During the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company repurchased million of Notes under these circumstances, and has agreed to indemnify additional Notes with an unpaid principal balance of million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Regulatory Contingencies 
 Prosper accrues for contingencies when a loss from such contingencies is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss is probable and if it is possible to quantify the amount of the estimated loss, Prosper reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters on at least a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If Prosper determines that an unfavorable outcome is not probable or that the amount of a loss cannot be reasonably estimated, Prosper does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and Prosper can estimate a range of outcomes, an amount is recorded which management considers to be the best estimate within the range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if management cannot quantify the amount of the estimated loss, then the low end of the range of the potential losses is recorded. 
 West Virginia Matter 
 In February 2020, Prosper received a proposed Assurance of Discontinuance (an AOD from the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia (the WV Attorney General requesting that, without in any way admitting that any of its prior practices were in violation of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (the Consumer Act ), Prosper agree to certain terms and conditions regarding its past and potential future conduct of its business with respect to customers in West Virginia, including a release by the WV Attorney General of any claims it may have related to the matters identified in the AOD. 
 We cannot predict the outcome of the matter and any potential fines or penalties, if any, that may arise from the matter. Further, we are unable to estimate a range of outcomes and as a result no accrual has been made. 
 No loans have been originated through the Prosper platform to West Virginians since June 2016 and the final loan originated through the Prosper platform to a borrower in West Virginia was repaid in October 2021.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Prosper Funding LLC 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Prosper Funding LLC and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, member s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Emphasis of a Matter 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company earns significant amounts of revenues and incurs significant expenses with a related party, its direct parent company, Prosper Marketplace, Inc. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company measures financial instruments at fair value including borrower loans and servicing assets. As of December 31, 2023, borrower loans were 324.3 million and servicing assets were 13.8 million. The Company estimates the fair values using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies incorporating significant unobservable inputs and valuation assumptions that are reflective of management s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instruments and requires significant management judgement or estimate. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation methodology for the servicing 
 F-52 

assets include the market servicing rate. For all level 3 financial instruments, significant unobservable inputs used in valuation methodology include discount rates, default rates and prepayment rates. 
 
 Auditing the methodology and significant unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair values of level 3 financial instruments required a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of these Level 3 financial instruments and unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value included the following key procedures: 
 
 We gained an understanding of the significance of inputs and assumptions using sensitivity analysis, identifying relevant inputs and assumptions for further testing. 
 
 With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent estimates of fair value and compared our estimates to the Company s estimates. 
 
 We tested the source information derived from the Company s data used in the valuation models. 
 
 We evaluated the reasonableness of the market servicing rate assumption used in developing the fair value estimate of the servicing assets.

 of a Borrower Loan directly from PFL. 
 All loans requested and obtained through the marketplace are unsecured obligations of individual borrowers with a fixed interest rate and original terms to maturity of 24, 36, 48 or 60 months as of December 31, 2023. All loans made through the marketplace are funded by WebBank, an FDIC-insured, Utah chartered industrial bank. After funding a loan, WebBank sells the loan to PFL, without recourse to WebBank, in exchange for the principal amount of the loan. WebBank does not have any obligation to purchasers of the Notes. 
 As of December 31, 2023, PFL s marketplace was open to investors in states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, PFL s marketplace was open to borrowers in states and the District of Columbia. Currently, the marketplace does not operate internationally.

of the outstanding balance. The fair value election for Notes and Borrower Loans allows both the assets and the related liabilities to receive similar accounting treatment for expected losses which is consistent with the subsequent cash flows to investors that are dependent upon borrower payments. As such, the fair value of a series of Notes is approximately equal to the fair value of the corresponding Borrower Loan, adjusted for the servicing fee and the timing of loan purchase, Note issuance and borrower payments. As a result, the valuation of the Notes uses the same methodology and assumptions as the Borrower Loans, except that the Notes incorporate the servicing fee and any differences in timing in payments. Any unrealized gains or losses on the Borrower Loans and Notes for which the fair value option has been elected is recorded as a separate line item in the statement of operations. The effective interest rate associated with a group of Notes is less than the interest rate earned on the corresponding Borrower Loan due to the servicing fee.

. PFL evaluates its software assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of software and website development assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such software and website development assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the software and website development assets.

The servicing fee com pensates PFL for the costs incurred in servicing the Borrower Loan, including managing payments from borrowers, managing payments to investors and maintaining investors account portfolios. PFL records Servicing Fees from investors as a component of operating revenue when received. 
 Loss (Gain) on Sale of Borrower Loans 
 PFL recognizes gains or losses on the sale of Borrower Loans when it sells Borrower Loans to third parties. PFL measures gain or loss on sale of Borrower Loans as the net proceeds received on the sale less the fair value of the Borrower Loans sold. The net proceeds of the sale represent the fair value of any assets obtained or liabilities incurred as part of the transaction, including, but not limited to Servicing Assets, retained securities, and repurchase obligations.

 Fair Value Valuation Method 
 PFL uses a discounted cash flow valuation methodology generally consisting of developing an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of a financial instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of return that results in the fair value amount. 
 Significant unobservable inputs presented in the table within Note 7 are those that PFL considers significant to the estimated fair values of the Level 3 Servicing Assets. The following is a description of the significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
 Market Servicing Rate 
 PFL estimates adequate market servicing rates that would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required, which includes the profit that would be demanded in the marketplace. This rate is stated as a fixed percentage of outstanding principal balance on a per annum basis. With the assistance of a valuation specialist, PFL estimates these market servicing rates based on observable market rates for other loan types in the industry and bids from sub-servicing providers, adjusted for the unique loan attributes that are present in the specific loans that PFL sells and services and information from backup service providers. 
 Discount Rate 
 The discount rate is a rate of return used to discount future expected cash flows to arrive at a present value, which represents the fair value of the loan servicing rights. Management used a range of discount rates for the Servicing Assets based

 Included in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 As PFL s Borrower Loans, Notes, Servicing Assets and loan trailing fee liability do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, PFL uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the Level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains and losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.

 (1) Servicing assets associated with loans enrolled in a relief program offered by the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were measured using a market servicing rate assumption of basis points. This rate was estimated using a multiplier consistent with observable market rates for other loan types, applied to the base market servicing rate assumption. 
 (2) Excludes collection fees that would be passed on to a hypothetical third-party servicer. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the market rate for col lection fees and non-sufficient fund fees was assumed to be basis points and basis points, respectively, for a weighted-average total market servicing rate of basis points to basis points and basis points to basis points, respectively.

 Loan Trailing Fee Liability 
 The fair value of the Loan Trailing Fee Liability represents the present value of the expected monthly Loan Trailing Fee payments, which takes into consideration certain assumptions related to expected prepayment rates and default rates using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions used are the same as those used for the valuation of Servicing Assets, as described below. 
 The following tables present additional information about Level 3 Loan Trailing Fee Liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be evaluated with care. The effect on fair value of a 10 variation in assumptions generally cannot be determined because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the fair value may not be linear. Additionally, the impact of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value is calculated while holding other assumptions constant. In reality, changes in one factor may lead to changes in other factors, which could impact the above hypothetical effects. 
 
 NOTE 8. 
 through February 1, 2025, Prosper is required to pay WebBank an amount equal to such deficiency. Accordingly, the minimum fee is million for 2024, and million in 2025. On February 28, 2024, the Origination and Sale Agreements were amended to, among other things, extend the terms through February 1, 2027. 
 Additionally, under the Origination and Sale Agreements, Prosper is required to maintain minimum net liquidity of million at all times during the term of the agreement. Net liquidity is defined as the sum of Cash, Cash Equivalents and 
 F-69 

, in the event the underlying borrower prepays the loan before full maturity. As of December 31, 2023, the PFL has accrued million related to anticipated future refunds under this obligation. 
 Loan Purchase Commitments 
 Under the terms of PFL's agreement with WebBank, PFL is committed to purcha se million of B orrower Loans that WebBank originated during the last two business days of the year ended December 31, 2023. PFL will purchase these Borrower Loans within the first two business days of the year ending December 31, 2023. 
 Repurchase Obligation 
 Under the terms of the loan purchase agreements between PFL and investors that participate in the Whole Loan Channel, PFL may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to repurchase a Borrower Loan from an investor. Generally, these circumstances include the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, the failure to properly follow personal loan listing or bidding protocols or a violation of the applicable federal, state or local lending laws. The fair value of the indemnification and repurchase obligation is estimated based on historical experience. PFL recognizes a liability for the repurchase and indemnification obligation when the Borrower Loans are issued. Indemnified or repurchased Borrower Loans associated with violations of federal, state or local lending laws or verifiable identity theft are written off at the time of repurchase or at the time an indemnification payment is made. The maximum potential amount of future payments associated under this repurchase obligation is the outstanding balances of the Borrower Loans issued through the Whole Loan Channel, which at December 31, 2023 was billion. PFL has accrued million and million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively in regard to this obligation. 
 Under the terms of the indenture and investor registration agreement, Prosper may, in certain circumstances, become obligated to either repurchase a Note or indemnify the investor for any losses resulting from nonpayment of a Note purchased in the Retail Channel. The decision to repurchase or indemnify is in Prosper s sole discretion. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of verifiable identity theft, a technical error in the automated bidding tools which results in the purchase of a Note that does not match the investor s investment criteria, or situations in which a personal loan listing includes a Prosper Rating that is different from the Prosper Rating that should have appeared in the listing for the corresponding Borrower Loan because either PFL inaccurately input data into, or inaccurately applied, the formula for determining the Prosper Rating and, as a result, the interest of the investor is materially and adversely affected. During the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company repurchased million of Notes under these circumstances, and has agreed to indemnify additional Notes with an unpaid principal balance of million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Regulatory Contingencies 
 PFL accrues for contingencies when a loss from such contingencies is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss is probable and if it is possible to quantify the amount of the estimated loss, PFL reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters on at least a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If PFL determines that an unfavorable outcome is not probable or that the amount of a loss cannot be reasonably estimated, PFL does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. If an unfavorable outcome is probable and PFL can estimate a range of outcomes, PFL records the amount management considers to be the best estimate within the range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if management cannot quantify the amount of the estimated loss, then PFL records the low end of the range of those potential losses. 
 West Virginia Matter 
 In February 2020, Prosper received a proposed Assurance of Discontinuance (an AOD from the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia (the WV Attorney General requesting that, without in any way admitting that any of its prior practices were in violation of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (the Consumer Act ), Prosper agree to certain terms and conditions regarding its past and potential future conduct of its business with respect to customers in West Virginia, including a release by the WV Attorney General of any claims it may have related to the matters identified in the AOD. 
 We cannot predict the outcome of the matter and any potential fines or penalties, if any, that may arise from the matter. Further, we are unable to estimate a range of outcomes and as a result no accrual has been made.

The Registration Statement became effective on September 23, 2021 pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Pursuant to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, Prosper Marketplace, Inc. has registered its continuous issuance of PMI Management Rights that are deemed to be attached to the Notes issued and sold by Prosper (including any Notes purchased pursuant to this Agreement), but as to which no purchase price is payable. The PMI Management Rights do not comprise a guarantee of payments on any Notes or corresponding Borrower Loans. Assets of Prosper Marketplace, Inc. are not available to 

satisfy Prosper s obligations in relation to Notes. Prosper will be the sole issuer of the Notes and Prosper Marketplace, Inc. will be the sole issuer of the PMI Management Rights. You should review this Agreement, the Terms of Use and any policies posted on Prosper s website at www.prosper.com , any subdomain thereof and any associated websites, desktop or mobile applications (collectively, the Prosper Terms and Conditions ), and the Prospectus carefully. You should print and retain a copy of these documents for your records. 
 
 In consideration of the covenants, agreements, representations and warranties hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, it is agreed as follows 
 
 1. Purchase and Sale of Notes. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Prosper will provide you the opportunity through its website and any associated websites, desktop or mobile applications (collectively, the Prosper websites 
 
 To review and bid on loan listings, which are requests for loans Borrower Loans that Prosper has received from its borrower members, with each such bid being at least 25 
 To purchase Notes from Prosper in the principal amount of the bids you place on loan listings, each such Note associated with, and dependent on, a specific Borrower Loan and 
 To instruct Prosper to apply the proceeds from the sale of each Note you purchase to facilitate the funding of a specific Borrower Loan you have designated. 
 
 Any bid you place on a loan listing is a commitment by you to purchase a Note from Prosper in the principal amount of the bid you placed on the loan listing. If the amount available for further bidding on a loan listing is less than the amount of your bid, your bid will be deemed to be in the amount still available for bidding. You must commit to purchase a Note to fund a Borrower Loan prior to the origination of that Borrower Loan. 

At the time you commit to purchase a Note, you must have sufficient funds on deposit in your account with Prosper to complete the purchase. The funds on deposit in your account with Prosper will be placed in an FDIC-insured account at Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. (the funding account separate from Prosper s own funds. Once you bid on a loan listing, it is irrevocable regardless of whether the full amount of the loan listing is funded, and you will not have access to the funds used to support your bid unless and until Prosper has notified you that the Borrower Loan will not be funded. If a loan listing on which you ve bid does not fund, Prosper will inform you and release you from your purchase commitment. Prosper does not warrant or guaranty that you will be able to place a bid on any loan listing before that loan listing receives bids totaling the requested loan amount. Prosper may allocate some of its loan listings to other investor funding channels. If it does so, it will allocate loan listings among its various investor channels, including this channel, automatically, based upon a random allocation methodology determined by Prosper. 
 
 All Notes are issued pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture between Prosper and an indenture trustee. 
 
 2. Issuance. Each time you purchase a Note, it will be issued immediately following the closing of the corresponding Borrower Loan. All Borrower Loans are originated by WebBank, an FDIC insured, Utah-chartered industrial bank. Prosper will use the proceeds of the sale of each series of Notes to purchase the corresponding Borrower Loan from WebBank. Borrower Loans generally close at the end of their 14-day listing period unless (1) the borrower member withdraws the loan request prior to funding (2) bids for the entire amount of the borrower member s loan request have been received earlier, in which case the Borrower Loan will close earlier or (3) the loan request is canceled by Prosper, WebBank or their respective agents for reasons relating to the operation and integrity of the Prosper websites, such as attempted fraud or a failure to verify information upon request.

If I receive an award from the arbitrator, you will reimburse me for any fees paid by me to the administrator or arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own attorney s, expert s and witness fees, which shall not be considered costs of arbitration however, if a statute gives me the right to recover these fees, or fees paid to the administrator or arbitrator, then these statutory rights will apply in arbitration. 
 e. Any in-person arbitration hearing will be held in the city with the federal district court closest to my residence, or in such other location as you and I may mutually agree. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16, and, if requested by either party, provide written reasoned findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator shall have the power to award any relief authorized under applicable law. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator s award. The arbitrator s decision will be final and binding except that (i) any party may exercise any appeal right under the FAA and (ii) any party may appeal any award relating to a claim for more than 100,000 to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the administrator, which will reconsider de novo any aspect of the appealed award. The panel s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the 

appeal s cost, regardless of its outcome. However, you will consider any reasonable written request by me for you to bear the cost. 
 f. YOU AND I AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING ARBITRATION CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR CAPACITY AS A SINGLE PERSON, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and I agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person s claims. The arbitrator shall have no power to arbitrate any Claims on a class action basis or Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other investors, or other persons similarly situated. The validity and effect of this paragraph f shall be determined exclusively by a court, and not by the administrator or any arbitrator. 
 g. If any portion of this Section 23 is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this section. However, if paragraph f of this Section 23 is deemed invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then this entire Section 23 shall be deemed invalid and unenforceable. The terms of this Section 23 will prevail if there is any conflict between the Rules and this section. 
 h. You and I acknowledge and agree that the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 23 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 23. This Section 23 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
