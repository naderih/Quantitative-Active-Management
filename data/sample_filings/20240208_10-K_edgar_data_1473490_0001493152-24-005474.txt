PART
I 

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Company
Overview 

Global
AI was organized as Mycatalogsonline.com, Inc. in the state of Nevada on January 6, 2009. In April 2009, the Company changed its name
to My Catalogs Online, Inc. In November 2012, the Company changed its name to Bright Mountain Holdings, Inc. In August 2013, the Company
changed its name to Wall Street Media Co, Inc. and in October 2023 the Company changed its name to Global AI, Inc. 

The
Company expects to acquire, integrate and develop artificial intelligence AI )-based technology companies and assets (the
 Acquisitions ). The Company intends to focus its Acquisitions on machine and deep learning, generative AI, computer vision,
natural language processing, and other AI technologies. The Company focuses on Acquisitions that are scalable and have revenue models
that provide for tangible growth. Once acquired, the Company plans to integrate and further develop the companies and assets acquired
in the Acquisitions to increase their existing customer base and further develop their existing products and services. The Company also
plans to cross-pollinate knowledge and strategies derived from each of its Acquisitions with other Acquisitions for the
benefit of the Company s network as a whole. In addition, the Company plans to centralize back office administrative functions
and take advantage of cost and revenue synergies across the Acquisitions platforms. 

On
September 12, 2023, Ingenious Investment AG purchased, from their own funds, from existing shareholders of the Company, in a series of
private transactions, a total of 24,944,466 shares of common stock, 0.001 per share of Global AI, Inc., representing 92.7 of the outstanding
shares of the Company s common stock at such time. 

The
Company has one employee and one full-time employee. 

Marketing
Strategy 

The
Company plans to broadly target Acquisitions that meet its target metrics for scalability and revenue growth. The Company offers an alternative
to traditional venture capital investments in the sector and provides entrepreneurs and founders with the ability to grow and scale their
AI technology businesses while benefiting from the knowledge of other entrepreneurs in the Company s network. The Company has a
strong pipeline of potential Acquisitions sourced by Mr Somani, who has extensive experience in AI technology. 

Once
acquired, the Company plans on assisting each portfolio Acquisition with its marketing strategy for its specific products and services. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

An
investment in our common stock is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and should be made only by investors who can afford
a complete loss of their investment. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information in
this annual report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, before you decide to buy our common stock.
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely
affected, the trading of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment therein. 

1 

Risks
Relating to the Early Stage of our Company 

We
are at a very early operational stage, our success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new business
venture. 

The
implementation of our business strategy is in a very early stage. Our business and operations should be considered to be in a very early
stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture. Accordingly, our intended business and
operations may not prove to be successful in the near future, if at all. Any future success that we might enjoy will depend upon many
factors, several of which may be beyond our control, or which cannot be predicted at this time, and which could have a material adverse
effect upon our financial condition, business prospects and operations and the value of an investment in our Company. 

We
have a very limited operating history and our business plan is unproven and may not be successful. 

To
date, we have not provided, licensed or sold any substantial amount of services and do not have any definitive agreements to do so. We
have not proven that our business model will allow us to generate a profit. 

We
have suffered operating losses since inception and we may not be able to achieve profitability. 

We
had an accumulated deficit of 1,527,246 as of September 30, 2023, and we expect to continue to incur significant developmental expenses
in the foreseeable future related to development of our AI technology business. As a result, we are sustaining substantial operating
and net losses, and it is possible that we will never be able to sustain or develop the revenue levels necessary to attain profitability. 

We
may have difficulty raising additional capital, which could deprive us of necessary resources. 

We
will need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing, collaborative relationships or other arrangements.
Our ability to raise additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control, including the state of capital markets and the
market price of our common stock. Because our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock
Exchange NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market NASDAQ ), many investors may not be willing or allowed to purchase
shares of our common stock or may demand steep discounts to the trading price of our common stock. Sufficient additional financing may
not be available to us or may be available only on terms that would result in substantial dilution to the current owners of our common
stock. 

We
expect to pursue additional capital during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, but we do not have any firm commitments for funding.
If we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital, or the terms of raising such capital are unacceptable, we may have to modify our
business plan and/or significantly curtail our planned activities and other operations. 

2 

There
are substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern and if we are unable to continue our business, our shares may
have little or no value. 

The
Company s ability to become a profitable operating company is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and/or obtain financing
adequate to support our cost structure. There can be no assurance that we will generate revenues or obtain financing. These factors have
raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to attempt to raise additional equity capital by
selling shares through one or more private placement or public offerings. However, the doubts raised, relating to our ability to continue
as a going concern, may make our shares an unattractive investment for potential investors. These factors, among others, may make it
difficult to raise any additional capital. 

Failure
to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect
our business and operating results. 

Any
future growth by us, or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships will create a strain on our managerial, operational
and financial resources. This strain may inhibit our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to implement our business plan
and could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business prospects and operations and the value of an investment
in our Company. 

Risks
Relating to Our Business 

We
will need to successfully acquire, develop and integrate AI-based technology companies and assets. 

We
may not be able to successfully source potential AI-based technology companies and assets Acquisitions ). We also may not
be able to effectively integrate and develop the Acquisitions into our network and cannot predict when significant commercial market
acceptance for the AI services provided by us and our Acquisitions will develop, if at all, and we cannot reliably estimate the projected
size of any such potential market. If markets fail to accept our AI services, we may not be able to generate revenues from the provision
of such services. Our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability acquire, integrate, and
develop our Acquisitions. If we are unable to do so, or if the services provided by us and our Acquisitions do not achieve wide market
acceptance, our business will be materially and adversely affected. 

We
will need to establish additional relationships with collaborative and development partners to fully develop and market our services. 

We
do not possess all of the resources necessary to develop and commercialize our AI technology business on a mass scale. Unless we expand
our development capacity and enhance our internal marketing, we will need to make appropriate arrangements with collaborative partners
to develop and commercialize consulting services. 

Collaborations
may allow us to: 

generate
 cash flow and revenue; 

offset
 some of the costs associated with our internal development; and 

successfully
 commercialize consulting services. 

If
we need, but do not find, appropriate partner arrangements, our ability to develop and commercialize consulting services could be adversely
affected. Even if we are able to find collaborative partners, the overall success of the development and commercialization of our services
will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control. In addition, in the event we pursue our commercialization
strategy through collaboration, there are a variety of attendant technical, business and legal risks, including: 

a development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information and knowledge, potentially enabling the partner to develop
services without us or design around our intellectual property; 

we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development
or commercialization of services, or to their marketing and distribution; and 

disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of
our services or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources. 

3 

The
occurrence of any of the above risks could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition. 

We
may lose out to larger competitors. 

The
AI technology services industry is intensely competitive. Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing
and distribution resources. Our services may not be competitive with their services. If this happens, our sales and revenues will decline.
In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater
development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. 

Risks
Relating to our Stock 

Future
stock issuances would dilute stockholders ownership, and may reduce our share value. 

If,
in the future, we issue additional shares, the future issuance of common stock or preferred stock may result in substantial dilution
in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an
arbitrary basis. Many of our Acquisitions will require the issuance of our common stock as part of the consideration provided. The issuance
of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares
held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock. 

Trading
on the OTC Markets is volatile, sporadic and often thin, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult
for our stockholders to resell their common stock. 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized
by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects.
This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC
Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed
on a stock exchange like NASDAQ or the NYSE. Our common stock has a history of thin trading. During the 52-week period ended September
30, 2023, trades were only reported on 15 trading days. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares
of our common stock. 

Our
common stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float. 

The
market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past. For example, as of September 30, 2023, our common stock has had a 52-week
high sale price of 0.5100 and a low sale price of 0.0710. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the
future, as well. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market s
adverse reaction to volatility. 

Other
factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things: 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; 

the
 absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us; 

we
 may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held; 

overall
 stock market fluctuations; 

announcements
 concerning our business or those of our competitors; 

actual
 or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms; 

4 

conditions
 or trends in the industry; 

litigation; 

changes
 in market valuations of other similar companies; 

future
 sales of common stock; 

departure
 of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and 

general
 market conditions. 

Any
of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in
general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating
performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless
of our actual operating performance. 

Our
common stock is currently, has been in the past, and may be in the future, a penny stock under SEC rules. It may be more
difficult to resell securities classified as penny stock. 

Our
common stock is a penny stock under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share
price below 5.00). Unless we obtain a per-share price above 5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers
that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as established customers or
 accredited investors. For example, broker-dealers must determine the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments
in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized
risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also
must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and
its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s
account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser s
written agreement to the transaction. 

5 

Legal
remedies available to an investor in penny stocks may include the following: 

If
 a penny stock is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states securities
 laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment. 

If
 a penny stock is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms
 that committed the fraud for damages. 

However,
investors who have signed arbitration agreements may have to pursue their claims through arbitration. 

These
requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes
subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers
from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements
may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock. 

Many
brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest
in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the increased financial
risk generally associated with these investments. 

For
these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance that our common
stock will not remain classified as a penny stock in the future. 

If
we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the price of our securities may be adversely affected. 

Our
internal control over financial reporting may have weaknesses and conditions that could require correction or remediation, the disclosure
of which may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. We are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal
control over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely
affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management s
assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal
control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions
that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management s assessment of our internal
control over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 

We
are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and if we fail to continue to comply, our business could be harmed and the price of our securities could decline. 

Rules
adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require an annual assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, and for certain issuers (but not us) an attestation of this assessment by the issuer s independent registered public
accounting firm. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are
evolving and complex, and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We expect
to incur significant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict
how long it will take or costly it will be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to
complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In the event that our Chief Executive Officer or principal financial
officer determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404, we cannot predict
how regulators will react or how the market prices of our securities will be affected; however, we believe that there is a risk that
investor confidence and the market value of our securities may be negatively affected. 

6 

Shares
eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market. 

From
time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage
transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general,
pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months, subject only to the current public information requirement.
Affiliates may sell after six months, subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), current public information,
and notice requirements. Given the limited trading of our common stock, resale of even a small number of shares of our common stock pursuant
to Rule 144 or an effective registration statement may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

The
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder s ability
to buy and sell our stock. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules discussed above, FINRA rules require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker -dealer
must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability to buy
and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares. 

An
investor s ability to trade our common stock may be limited by trading volume. 

The
Company s shares are currently quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol, WSCO. An active trading market for our common
stock has not developed, and may not develop, on the OTCQB. During the 52-week period ended September 30, 2023, trades were only reported
on 15 trading days. A limited trading volume may prevent our shareholders from selling shares at such times or in such amounts as they
may otherwise desire. 

Our
Company has a concentration of stock ownership and control, which may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change
of control. 

Our
common stock ownership is highly concentrated. Through ownership of shares of our common stock, one shareholder, Ingenious Investment
AG, beneficially owns approximately 82 of our total outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the concentrated ownership of
the stock, this stockholder, acting alone, will be able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election
of directors and approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect
of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our Company. It could also deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to
receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our Company and it may affect the market price of our common stock. 

We
have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections
against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. 

Federal
legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote
the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements;
others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ, on
which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges,
are those that address the Board of Directors independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. As
our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to adopt corporate governance measures however we
intend to adopt such measures in the future. It is possible that if we were to adopt corporate governance measures, shareholders would
benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies
had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised
of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and
recommendations for director nominees, may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being
decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment
decisions.

Because
we will not pay dividends in the foreseeable future, stockholders will only benefit from owning common stock if it appreciates. 

We
have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any future
earnings to finance our growth. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends from his investment
should not purchase our common stock.

Market
Information 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB market tier of the OTC Markets Group under the symbol WSCO. Securities quoted on the
OTCQB trade via a dealer network, as opposed to trading on a centralized stock exchange, such as the NYSE. In order to have securities
quoted on the OTCQB, a company must be current in its financial reporting, but it is not subject to any minimum financial requirements
and listing standards, as is the case with national securities exchanges. Trading in OTCQB stocks can be volatile, sporadic and risky,
as thinly traded stocks tend to move more rapidly in price than more liquid securities. Such trading may also depress the market price
of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their common stock. 

8 

The
following table sets forth, as reported by the OTCQB, the per share high and low bid quotations for our common stock for each of the
periods indicated. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily
represent actual transactions. The data in the table below presents historical information only and is not intended to predict future
sale prices of our common stock. Trading in securities, such as our common stock, on the OTC Markets may be volatile and thin and characterized
by wide fluctuations in trading prices. See Risk Factors Trading on the OTC Markets is volatile, sporadic and often thin,
which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our security holders to resell their common stock.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

In
response to the Securities and Exchange Commission s (the SEC financial reporting release, FR-60, Cautionary Advice
Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, the Company has selected its more subjective accounting estimation processes
for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate, in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to
the estimate and the possible effects on the Company s financial condition. These accounting estimates are discussed below. These
estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create a material adverse impact on the Company s results of operations
and financial condition 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognized revenue using the five-step revenue recognition model as prescribed by ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers . The underlying principle of new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods
or services. The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact
on its financial statements.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

The
Company s results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were generated from our legacy consulting
services business. Our current focus on acquiring and developing AI-technology companies and assets are therefore not reflected in these
results of operations. 

FOR
THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 

Revenue:
 The Company s revenues decreased approximately 18 from 60,000 during the year ended September 30, 2022 to 49,000 for the
year ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in consulting services provided. All revenues generated during the years ended September
30, 2023 and 2022 are with related parties. 

Operating
Expenses: The Company s operating expenses increased approximately 192 from 55,504 during the year ended September 30, 2022
to 162,253 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for this was due to the increase in professional fees. 

Interest
Expense: The Company s interest expense decreased approximately 24 from 3,738 during the year ended September 30, 2022 as
compared to 2,855 for the year ended September 30, 2023 due to the decrease in notes payable during the year. 

Income
from Operations: The Company s income from operations decreased approximately 262 from 4,496 for the year ended September
30, 2022 as compared to loss from operations of 113,253 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for this was due to
the increase in professional fees expense. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 86,553 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities
of 2,036 for the year ended September 30, 2022, due to the net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 174,863 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to net cash provided by investing
activities of 0 for the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the proceeds from the Ingenious Acquisition. 

Net
cash used in financing activities was 94,120 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 2,620 for the year ended September
30, 2022, primarily due to the repayment of the note payable related party. 

The
working capital deficit was 27,983 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to a working capital deficit of 86,738 for the
year ended September 30, 2022. 

As
of September 30, 2023, the Company had 2 in cash. The Company plans to fund ongoing operations by continuing to pursue contracts to
provide AI consulting services in efforts to generate additional revenue. In addition, the Company is actively seeking investor funding.

RECENTLY
ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In
August, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and other options which simplifies the accounting
for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. The ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU is not expected to
have a material impact on the financial statements and disclosures of the Company since it does not have any debt that meets the criteria. 

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources,
that is material to investors.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Global AI, Inc. (formerly Wall Street Media Co., Inc.) 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Global AI, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements
of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30,
2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses, has incurred negative cash flows from operations and has an
accumulated deficit and negative working capital. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 2 to the financial statements.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We determined
that there were no critical audit matters.

income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. At September 30, 2023, the Company has net operating losses NOL of approximately . Under IRS Code Section 382, the annual allowable NOL deduction will be limited to per year for years

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a 15(e). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed
in an issuer s reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our objectives and processes and effect on the information
generated for use in this report. This type of evaluation is done quarterly so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these
controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. We intend to maintain these controls as processes that may be appropriately
modified as circumstances warrant. 

Based
on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are not effective in timely alerting our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer to material information which is required
to be included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC as of the end of the period covering this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of September 30, 2023, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2023. 

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 

This
annual report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. We were not required to have, nor have we engaged our independent registered
public accounting firm to perform, an audit on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit
us to provide only management s report in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
our most recent fiscal year, there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

We
do not have a written policy for the review, approval or ratification of transactions with related parties or conflicted transactions.
When such transactions arise, they are referred to our Board of Directors for its consideration. 49,000 and 60,000, or 100 of the
Company s revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was derived from Landmark-Pegasus, a
related party. Landmark-Pegasus is wholly owned by John Moroney, who beneficially owned approximately 59.8 of the Company s common
stock prior to the Ingenious Acquisition. Mr. Moroney still acts as Landmark-Pegasus President and is Landmark-Pegasus 
sole director. The Company previously provided services solely to Landmark-Pegasus and to a client of Landmark-Pegasus. 

Director
Independence 

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB market tier of the OTC Markets Group, which does not have director independence requirements. We
also have not established our own definition for determining whether our director and nominees for directors are independent 
nor have we adopted any other standard of independence employed by any national securities exchange. 

ITEM
14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

We
do not currently have an audit committee; however it is our policy to have all audit and audit-related fees pre-approved by the Board
of Directors. 

The
Board of Directors reviews and approves audit and permissible non-audit services performed by its independent registered public accounting
firm, as well as the fees charged for such services. In its review of non-audit service and its appointment of Hudgens CPAs as our independent
registered public accounting firm, the Board of Directors considered whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining
independence. All of the services provided and fees charged by our independent registered public accounting firm in 2023 and 2022 were
approved by the Board of Directors.
