 DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE 

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 of American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and American Assets Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which American Assets Trust, Inc. is the parent company and sole general partner. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to we, us, our or the company refer to American Assets Trust, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. In statements regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, such terms refer solely to American Assets Trust, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to our Operating Partnership or the Operating Partnership refer to American Assets Trust, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 American Assets Trust, Inc. operates as a REIT and is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2023, American Assets Trust, Inc. owned an approximate 78.8 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 21.2 partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. 
 
 The company believes that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership into a single report will result in the following benefits: 
 better reflects how management and the analyst community view the business as a single operating unit; 
 enhance investors' understanding of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 
 greater efficiency for American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership and resulting savings in time, effort and expense; and 
 greater efficiency for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure by providing a single document for their review. 
 
 The management of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership is the same and operates American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. 
 
 There are certain differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the disclosures in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in the context of how American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated consolidated company. American Assets Trust, Inc. is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, American Assets Trust, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. American Assets Trust, Inc. itself does not hold any indebtedness. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all the assets of the company, directly or indirectly holds the ownership interests in the company's real estate ventures, conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly-traded equity. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by American Assets Trust, Inc., which are generally contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of operating partnership units. 
 
 Noncontrolling interests and stockholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of American Assets Trust, Inc. and those of American Assets Trust, L.P. The partnership interests in the Operating Partnership that are not owned by American Assets Trust, Inc. are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in American Assets Trust, Inc. s financial statements. To help investors understand the significant differences between American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership: 
 consolidated financial statements; 
 the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 Debt; 
 Equity/Partners' Capital; and 
 Earnings Per Share/Unit; 
 Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities; and 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

This report also includes separate Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of American Assets Trust, Inc. have made the requisite certifications and American Assets Trust, Inc. and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. 1350.

Forward Looking Statements. 
 We make statements in this report that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). In particular, statements pertaining to our capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain forward-looking statements. Likewise, our statements regarding anticipated growth in our funds from operations and anticipated market conditions, demographics and results of operations are forward-looking statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates or anticipates or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. 
 Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely on them as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods which may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: 
 adverse economic or real estate developments in our markets; 
 defaults on, early terminations of or non-renewal of leases by tenants, including significant tenants; 
 decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates; 
 our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness; 
 fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs; 
 our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; 
 our inability to develop or redevelop our properties due to market conditions; 
 Investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated; 
 general economic conditions; 
 financial market fluctuations; 
 risks that affect the general office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use environment; 
 the competitive environment in which we operate; 
 system failures or security incidents through cyberattacks; 
 the impact of epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks of illness, disease or virus (such as the outbreak of COVID-19 and its variants) and the actions taken by government authorities and others related thereto, including the ability of our company, our properties and our tenants to operate; 
 difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions; 
 our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations; 
 risks related to joint venture arrangements; 
 potential litigation; 
 difficulties in completing dispositions; 
 conflicts of interests with our officers or directors; 
 lack or insufficient amounts of insurance; 
 environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; 
 other factors affecting the real estate industry generally; 
 limitations imposed on our business and our ability to satisfy complex rules in order for American Assets Trust, Inc. to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and 
 changes in governmental regulations or interpretations thereof, such as real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates and taxation of REITs. 
 
 While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, or new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 1 

Summary of Risk Factors 
 An investment in our securities is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section entitled "Item 1.A Risk Factors." The following is a summary of some of the principal risks related to an investment in our company. 
 Our portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii, which may cause us to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. 
 Work from home, flexible work schedules, open workplaces, videoconferencing, and teleconferencing have become more common, particularly as a result of COVID-19, which may reduce the demand for office space and cause a reduction of rental rates and property valuation at our office properties on a temporary and/or prolonged basis. 
 We depend on significant tenants in our office properties, and a bankruptcy, insolvency or inability to pay rent of any of these tenants may adversely affect the income produced by our office properties and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants. 
 Many of the leases at our retail properties contain co-tenancy or go-dark provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations or terminate their leases, any of which could adversely affect our performance or the value of the applicable retail property. 
 We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire, thereby increasing or prolonging vacancies, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 We face risks relating to system failures or security incidents through cyberattacks that could disrupt our information technology IT networks, enterprise applications, and related systems; cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. 
 We face significant competition for acquisitions of real properties, which may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of these acquisitions. 
 High mortgage rates and/or unavailability of mortgage debt may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire, our net income and the amount of cash distributions we can make. 
 Mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt. 
 Our third amended and restated credit facility, note purchase agreements and amended term loan agreement restrict our ability to engage in some business activities, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures and make certain investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment, such as weakness in the economy, the level of consumer spending, the adverse financial condition of large retailing companies and competition from discount and internet retailers, any of which could adversely affect market rents for retail space and the willingness or ability of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers. 
 We face significant competition in the leasing market, which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. 
 We are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality and tourism industries, including competition for guests with other hospitality properties and general and local economic conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, any of which could adversely affect the revenues generated by our hospitality or other properties. 
 Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development, such as unanticipated expenses, delays and other contingencies, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 
 2 

Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed, and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and to implement our growth strategies, or could create a negative perception in the capital markets. 
 The continuing impacts of COVID-19 and restrictions intended to prevent its spread, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 Potential losses from earthquakes in California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii may not be fully covered by insurance. 
 We may be adversely affected by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change. 
 Our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could limit our ability, among other things, to meet our capital and operating needs or make the cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and the real estate industry, including local oversupply, reduction in demand or adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties, which could decrease revenues or increase costs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our property taxes could increase due to property tax rate changes or reassessment, which would adversely impact our cash flows. 
 As an owner of real estate, we could incur significant costs and liabilities related to environmental matters. 
 Failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. 
 To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions, and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock.

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 General 
 Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, our, us and our company refer to American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership, of which we are the sole general partner and which we refer to in this report as our Operating Partnership. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to American Assets Trust, Inc. 
 We are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii. As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio is comprised of twelve office properties; twelve retail shopping centers; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and six multifamily properties. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development and construction in progress. Our core markets include San Diego, California; the San Francisco Bay Area, California; Bellevue, Washington; Portland, Oregon and Oahu, Hawaii. 
 American Assets Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that was formed on July 16, 2010 to acquire the entities owning various controlling and noncontrolling interests in real estate assets owned and/or managed by Ernest S. Rady or his affiliates, including the Ernest Rady Trust U/D/T March 13, 1983, or the Rady Trust, and did not have any operating activity until the consummation of our initial public offering and the related acquisition of such interest on January 19, 2011. After the completion of our initial public offering and the related acquisitions, our operations have been carried on through our Operating Partnership. American Assets Trust, Inc., as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned 78.8 of our Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners and operators of commercial real estate and will enable us to take advantage of new acquisition and development opportunities, as well as growth opportunities within our portfolio: 
 Irreplaceable Portfolio of High Quality Office, Retail and Multifamily Properties. We have acquired and developed a high quality portfolio of office, retail and multifamily properties located in affluent neighborhoods and sought-after business centers in San Diego, California, the San Francisco Bay Area, California, Bellevue, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Antonio, Texas and Oahu, Hawaii. Many of our properties are located in in-fill locations where developable land is scarce or where we believe current zoning, environmental and entitlement regulations significantly restrict new development. We believe that the location of many of our properties will provide us an advantage in terms of generating higher internal revenue growth on a relative basis. 
 Experienced and Committed Senior Management Team with Strong Sponsorship. The members of our senior management team have significant experience in all aspects of the commercial real estate industry. 
 Properties Located in High-Barrier-to-Entry Markets with Strong Real Estate Fundamentals. Our core markets currently include Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii, which we believe have attractive long-term real estate fundamentals driven by favorable supply and demand characteristics. 
 Extensive Market Knowledge and Long-Standing Relationships Facilitate Access to a Pipeline of Acquisition and Leasing Opportunities. We believe that our in-depth market knowledge and extensive network of long-standing relationships in the real estate industry provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive acquisition and investment opportunities in and near our core markets, while also facilitating our leasing efforts and providing us with opportunities to increase occupancy rates at our properties. 
 Internal Growth Prospects through Development, Redevelopment and Repositioning. The development and redevelopment potential at several of our properties presents compelling growth prospects and our expertise enhances our ability to capitalize on these opportunities. 
 
 4 

Broad Real Estate Expertise with Office, Retail and Multifamily Focus. Our senior management team has strong experience and capabilities across the real estate sector with significant expertise in the office, retail and multifamily asset classes, which provides for flexibility in pursuing attractive acquisition, development and repositioning opportunities. Ernest Rady, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert Barton, our Chief Financial Officer, each have over 30 years of commercial real estate experience, and the other members of senior management, including Adam Wyll, our President and Chief Operating Officer, each have over 20 years of commercial real estate experience. 
 Business and Growth Strategies 
 Our primary business objectives are to increase operating cash flows, generate long-term growth and maximize stockholder value. Specifically, we pursue the following strategies to achieve these objectives: 
 Capitalizing on Acquisition Opportunities in High-Barrier-to-Entry Markets. We intend to pursue growth through the strategic acquisition of attractively priced, high quality properties that are well located in their submarkets, focusing on markets that generally are characterized by strong supply and demand characteristics, including high barriers to entry and diverse industry bases, that appeal to institutional investors. 
 Repositioning/Redevelopment and Development of Office, Retail and Multifamily Properties. Our strategy is to selectively reposition and redevelop several of our existing or newly-acquired properties, and we will also selectively pursue ground-up development of undeveloped land where we believe we can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Disciplined Capital Recycling Strategy. Our strategy is to pursue an efficient asset allocation strategy that maximizes the value of our investments by selectively disposing of properties whose returns appear to have been maximized and redeploying capital into acquisition, repositioning, redevelopment and development opportunities with higher return prospects, in each case in a manner that is consistent with our qualification as a REIT. 
 Proactive Asset and Property Management. We actively manage our properties, employ targeted leasing strategies, leverage our existing tenant relationships and focus on reducing operating expenses to increase occupancy rates at our properties, attract high quality tenants and increase property cash flows, thereby enhancing the value of our properties. 
 Human Capital 
 At December 31, 2023, we had 228 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. We believe our commitment to our human capital resources is an important component of our business that enables us to deliver superior performance in the ownership, operation, acquisition, and development of our high quality office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties and tenant relationships. We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions in open dialogues with our human resources department and senior management. We also provide all employees with a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal. 
 The safety and well-being of our employees is a paramount value for us, and the health and wellness of our employees is critical to our success. We provide our employees with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs designed to support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage healthy behaviors. 
 Additionally, we provide competitive compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, employees may be eligible to receive annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and family care resources. 
 We are committed to cultivating a diverse culture of inclusion that we believe makes a positive difference in our employees lives and we actively work to improve workplace diversity, equity and inclusion. As of December 31, 2023, our employees were: 
 45.0 female; 54.5 male; and 0.5 non-binary; and 
 55.3 ethnically diverse (i.e., Asian, African American, Hispanic or Latino and other (Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander and two or more of the foregoing)).

Tax Status 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and believe we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income to our stockholders (excluding any net capital gains). 
 Insurance 
 We carry comprehensive general liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy or standalone policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark, cyber and pollution coverage, that may be appropriate for certain of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for our properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover our losses. We do not carry insurance for certain losses, including losses caused by riots or war. Some of our policies, like those covering losses due to terrorism, hail, flood, named storm and earthquakes, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses for such events. In addition, all our properties except our property located in San Antonio, Texas are subject to an increased risk of earthquakes. While we carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes. We may self-insure, reduce or discontinue casualty, earthquake, terrorism or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. Also, if destroyed, we may not be able to rebuild certain of our properties due to current zoning and land use regulations. As a result, we may be required to incur significant costs in the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. In addition, our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage if the market value of our portfolio increases. If we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds applicable policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future if the costs associated with property and casualty renewals become higher than anticipated or insurance carriers no longer offer certain coverage. 
 Regulation 
 Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and the Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988, or the FHAA, that impose further restrictions on our properties and operations. Under the ADA and the FHAA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Some of our properties may currently be in non-compliance with the ADA or the FHAA. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA, the FHAA or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance and we might incur governmental fines or be required to pay damages to private litigants. In addition, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. For additional information, see the section titled Risk Factors Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry We may incur significant costs complying with various federal, state and local laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties. 
 Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or use our properties as collateral for future borrowings. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. 
 
 6 

Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property, or adjacent properties, for commercial or industrial purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. For example, Del Monte Center is currently undergoing remediation of dry cleaning solvent contamination from a former onsite dry cleaner. The environmental issue is currently in the final stages of remediation which entails the long term ground monitoring by the appropriate regulatory agency over the next five to seven years. The prior owner of Del Monte Center entered into a fixed fee environmental services agreement in 1997 pursuant to which the remediation will be completed for approximately 3.5 million, with the remediation costs paid for through funds held in an escrow account funded by the prior owner. We expect that the funds in this escrow account will cover all remaining costs and expenses of the environmental remediation. However, if the Regional Water Quality Control Board - Central Coast Region were to require further work costing more than the remaining escrowed funds, we could be required to pay such overage although we may have a claim for such costs against the prior owner or our environmental remediation consultant. In addition to the foregoing, though we possess Phase I Environmental Site Assessments for certain of the properties in our portfolio, these assessments are limited in scope (e.g., they do not generally include soil sampling, subsurface investigations or hazardous materials survey) and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. Furthermore, we do not have Phase I Environmental Site Assessment reports for all of the properties in our portfolio and, as such, we may not be aware of all potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities at the properties in our portfolio. As a result, we could potentially incur material liability for these issues, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 As the owner of the buildings on our properties, we could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in our buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if we do not comply with such laws, we could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, we could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in our buildings, and we could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in our buildings. In addition, some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. For additional information, see the section titled Risk Factors Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry As an owner of real estate, we could incur significant costs and liabilities related to environmental matters. 
 Competition 
 We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located and some of which have greater financial resources than we do. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, flexibility and expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-let space in light of the large number of competing properties within the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space. In such cases, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends may be adversely affected. 
 We also face competition when pursuing acquisition and disposition opportunities. Our competitors may be able to pay higher property acquisition prices, may have private access to opportunities not available to us and otherwise may be in a better position to acquire a property. Competition may also have the effect of reducing the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us, increasing the price required to consummate an acquisition opportunity and generally reducing the demand for office, retail, mixed-use and multifamily space in our markets. Likewise, competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers may result in us receiving lower proceeds from a sale or in us not being able to dispose of a property at a time of our choosing due to the lack of an acceptable return. 
 Segments 
 We operate in four business segments: office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use. Information related to our business segments for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is set forth in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report.

Tenants Accounting for over 10 of Revenues 
 None of our tenants accounted for more than 10 of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021. LPL Holdings, Inc. at La Jolla Commons accounted for approximately 13.2 , 13.2 and 14.4 of total office segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Google LLC at The Landmark at One Market accounted for approximately 10.4 , 12.7 and 13.6 of total office segment revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 The following section includes the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. The risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This discussion of risk factors includes many forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on forward-looking statements, please refer to the section entitled Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 Our portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii, which may cause us to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. 
 Our properties are located in California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii, and substantially all of our properties are concentrated in California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii, which exposes us to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse economic or other conditions in these markets (such as periods of economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changes in the local or global tourism industry, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation), as well as to natural disasters that occur in these markets (such as earthquakes, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and other events). If there is a downturn in the economy in these markets, our operations and our revenue and cash available for distribution, including cash available to pay distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders, could be materially adversely affected. We cannot assure you that these markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners and operators of office, retail, mixed-use or multifamily properties. Our operations may also be affected if competing properties are built in any of these markets. Moreover, submarkets within any of our core markets may be dependent upon a limited number of industries. In addition, the State of California is regarded as more litigious, highly regulated and taxed than many other states, all of which may reduce demand for office, retail, mixed-use or multifamily space in California. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in the California, Washington, Oregon, Texas or Hawaii markets, or any decrease in demand for office, retail, multifamily or mixed-use space resulting from the regulatory environment, business climate or energy or fiscal problems, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 We may be adversely affected by trends in office real estate. 
 In 2023, approximately 53 of our net operating income was from our office properties. Work from home, flexible work schedules, open workplaces, videoconferencing, and teleconferencing have become more common, particularly as a result of the pandemic. These practices may enable businesses to reduce their office space requirements. There is also an increasing trend among some businesses to utilize shared office spaces and co-working spaces. A continuation of the movement towards these practices could, over time, erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 9 

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. 
 At February 14, 2024, we had total debt outstanding of 1.70 billion, excluding debt issuance costs, a portion of which contains non-recourse carve-out guarantees and environmental indemnities from us and our Operating Partnership, and we may incur significant additional debt to finance future acquisition and development activities. At December 31, 2023, we also had a third amended and restated credit facility with a capacity of 500 million, consisting of a revolving line of credit of 400 million and an unsecured term loan of 100 million (Term Loan A). Additionally, on January 5, 2023, we amended and restated our term loan agreement (a separate facility from that described in the preceding sentence) to consist of unsecured term loans of 225 million (Term Loan B and Term Loan C). Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties or to pay the dividends currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following: 
 our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; 
 we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to meet operational needs; 
 we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness; 
 we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject; 
 we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and 
 our default under any loan with cross-default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness. 
 If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Furthermore, foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the Code. 
 We depend on significant tenants in our office properties, and a bankruptcy, insolvency or inability to pay rent of any of these tenants may adversely affect the income produced by our office properties and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the three largest tenants in our office portfolio - Google LLC, LPL Holdings, Inc. and Autodesk, Inc. - represented approximately 30.6 of the total annualized base rent in our office portfolio in the aggregate, and 13.5 , 10.1 and 7.0 , respectively, of the annualized base rent generated by our office properties. Google LLC is a subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc. and provides internet related products and services. LPL Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of LPL Financial Holdings, Inc. and provides an integrated platform of brokerage and investment advisory services to independent financial advisors and financial advisors at financial institutions in the United States. Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that focuses on 3-D design software for use in the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment industries. The inability of a significant tenant to pay rent or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our office properties. If a tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent, federal law may prohibit us from evicting such tenant based solely upon such bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, a bankrupt or insolvent tenant may be authorized to reject and terminate its lease with us. Any claim against such tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. If any of these tenants were to experience a downturn in its business or a weakening of its financial condition resulting in its failure to make timely rental payments or causing it to default under its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. Any such event could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants. 
 Our retail shopping center properties typically are anchored by large, nationally recognized tenants. At any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. As a result, our tenants, including our anchor and other major tenants, may fail to comply with their contractual obligations to us, seek concessions in order to continue operations or declare bankruptcy, any of which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, certain of our tenants may cease operations while continuing to pay rent, which could decrease customer traffic, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at the applicable retail property. In addition to these potential effects of a business downturn, mergers or consolidations among large 
 
 10 

retail establishments could result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations, which could include stores at our retail properties. 
 Loss of, or a store closure by, an anchor or major tenant could significantly reduce our occupancy level or the rent we receive from our retail properties, and we may not have the right to re-lease vacated space or we may be unable to re-lease vacated space at attractive rents or at all. Moreover, in the event of default by a major tenant or anchor store, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties. The occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves an anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations, could seriously harm our performance and could adversely affect the value of the applicable retail property. 
 As of December 31, 2023, our largest anchor tenants were Lowe's, Sprouts Farmers Market and Nordstrom Rack, which together represented approximately 10.4 of our total annualized base rent of our retail portfolio in the aggregate, and 5.3 , 2.8 and 2.3 , respectively, of the annualized base rent generated by our retail properties. 
 Many of the leases at our retail properties contain co-tenancy or go-dark provisions, which, if triggered, may allow tenants to pay reduced rent, cease operations or terminate their leases, any of which could adversely affect our performance or the value of the applicable retail property. 
 Many of the leases at our retail properties contain co-tenancy provisions that condition a tenant's obligation to remain open, the amount of rent payable by the tenant or the tenant's obligation to continue occupancy on certain conditions, including: (1) the presence of a certain anchor tenant or tenants; (2) the continued operation of an anchor tenant's store; and (3) minimum occupancy levels at the applicable retail property. If a co-tenancy provision is triggered by a failure of any of these or other applicable conditions, a tenant could have the right to cease operations, to terminate its lease early or to a reduction of its rent. In periods of prolonged economic decline or government-imposed restrictions on operations (such as restrictions intended to reduce the spread of illness), there is a higher than normal risk that co-tenancy provisions will be triggered as there is a higher risk of tenants closing stores or terminating leases during these periods. In addition to these co-tenancy provisions, certain of the leases at our retail properties contain go-dark provisions that allow the tenant to cease operations while continuing to pay rent. This could result in decreased customer traffic at the applicable retail property, thereby decreasing sales for our other tenants at that property, which may result in our other tenants being unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. These provisions also may result in lower rental revenue generated under the applicable leases. To the extent co-tenancy or go-dark provisions in our retail leases result in lower revenue or tenant sales or tenants' rights to terminate their leases early or to a reduction of their rent, our performance or the value of the applicable retail property could be adversely affected. 
 We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of properties that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth. 
 Our business strategy involves the acquisition of office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties. These activities require us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategies. We continue to evaluate the market of available properties and may attempt to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist. However, we may be unable to acquire properties identified as potential acquisition opportunities. Our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms, or at all, may be exposed to the following significant risks: 
 we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete; 
 even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of properties, these agreements are subject to conditions to closing, which we may be unable to satisfy; and 
 we may be unable to finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all. 
 If we are unable to finance property acquisitions or acquire properties on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, failure to identify or complete acquisitions of suitable properties could slow our growth. 
 We face significant competition for acquisitions of real properties, which may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of these acquisitions. 
 The current market for acquisitions continues to be extremely competitive. This competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties. We also face significant competition for attractive acquisition opportunities from an indeterminate number of investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private equity investors and institutional investment funds, some of which have greater financial resources than we do, a greater 
 
 11 

ability to borrow funds to acquire properties and the ability to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the geographic proximity of investments and the payment of higher acquisition prices. This competition will increase if investments in real estate become more attractive relative to other forms of investment. Competition for investments may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and may have the effect of increasing prices paid for such acquisition properties and/or reducing the rents we can charge and, as a result, adversely affecting our operating results. 
 We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire, thereby increasing or prolonging vacancies, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 As of December 31, 2023, leases representing 7.1 of the square footage and 8.8 of the annualized base rent of the properties in our office, retail and retail portion of our mixed-use portfolios will expire in 2024, and an additional 10.3 of the square footage of the properties in our office, retail and retail portion of our mixed-use portfolios was available. We cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-let at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. In addition, our ability to lease our multifamily properties at favorable rates, or at all, is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels, recession, personal debt levels, the downturn in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 Our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital. 
 If economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, including as a result of factors such as economic recessions causing volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets and/or a high interest rate environment, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms than our current debt financings or may otherwise be unable to refinance our existing debt facilities on more favorable terms. Equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares. We cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. Our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. Depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy, including the development and redevelopment of our assets, on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy. 
 High mortgage rates and/or unavailability of mortgage debt may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire, our net income and the amount of cash distributions we can make. 
 If mortgage debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to finance the purchase of properties. If we place mortgage debt on properties, we may be unable to refinance the properties when the loans become due, or to refinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance our properties, our income could be reduced. If any of these events occur, our cash flow could be reduced. This, in turn, could reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and unitholders and may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money. 
 Mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt. 
 Incurring mortgage and other secured debt obligations increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default. Any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could adversely affect the overall value of our portfolio of properties. Moreover, repayment of mortgage and other secured debt obligations could limit the funds that are available to repay our unsecured debt obligations. For tax purposes, a foreclosure on any of our properties that is subject to a nonrecourse mortgage loan would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. 
 
 12 

Our future acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect, and we may otherwise be unable to operate these properties to meet our financial expectations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our future acquisitions and our ability to successfully operate the properties we acquire in such acquisitions may be exposed to the following significant risks: 
 even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price; 
 we may acquire properties that are not accretive to our results upon acquisition, and we may not successfully manage and lease those properties to meet our expectations; 
 our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; 
 we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties; 
 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; 
 market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates; and 
 we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities, such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. 
 If we cannot operate acquired properties to meet our financial expectations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to control our operating costs or our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if our revenues do not increase, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. 
 Factors that may adversely affect our ability to control operating costs include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, which could increase over time, the need periodically to repair, renovate and re-lease space, the cost of compliance with governmental regulation, including zoning and tax laws, the potential for liability under applicable laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. If our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 The expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property. As a result, if revenues decline, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly. Costs associated with real estate investments, such as real estate taxes, insurance, loan payments and maintenance, generally will not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. If we are unable to decrease operating costs when demand for our properties decreases and our revenues decline, our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders may be adversely affected. 
 Some of our financing arrangements involve balloon payment obligations, which may adversely affect our ability to make distributions. 
 Some of our financing arrangements require us to make a lump-sum or balloon payment at maturity. Our ability to make a balloon payment at maturity is uncertain and may depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing or our ability to sell the property. At the time the balloon payment is due, we may or may not be able to refinance the existing financing on terms as favorable as the original loan or sell the property at a price sufficient to make the balloon payment. The effect of a refinancing or sale could affect the rate of return to stockholders and the projected time of disposition of our assets. In addition, payments of principal and interest made to service our debts may leave us with insufficient cash to pay the distributions that we are required to pay to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Rules and regulations applicable to REITs impose certain restrictions on our ability to utilize hedges, swaps and other types of derivatives to hedge our liabilities. Subject to these restrictions, we may enter into hedging transactions to protect us 
 
 13 

from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt. Our hedging transactions may include entering into interest rate cap agreements or interest rate swap agreements. As described under Note 8. "Derivative and Hedging Activities," to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have entered into several interest rate swap agreements that are intended to reduce the interest rate variability exposure with respect to certain of our indebtedness. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that such arrangements would not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes or that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. In addition, interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. Hedging could reduce the overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. In addition, while such agreements would be intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they could also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements would not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements or that the underlying transactions could fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . 
 Our third amended and restated credit facility, note purchase agreements and amended term loan agreement restrict our ability to engage in some business activities, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures and make certain investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our third amended and restated credit facility, note purchase agreements and amended term loan agreement contain customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants that, among other things: 
 restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness; 
 restrict our ability to incur additional liens; 
 restrict our ability to make certain investments (including certain capital expenditures); 
 restrict our ability to merge with another company; 
 restrict our ability to sell or dispose of assets; 
 restrict our ability to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders; and 
 require us to satisfy minimum financial coverage ratios, minimum tangible net worth requirements and/or maximum leverage ratios. 
 These limitations restrict our ability to engage in some business activities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. In addition, our credit facility contains specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the lenders and/or note purchasers the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. 
 The effective subordination of our unsecured indebtedness may reduce amounts available for payment on our unsecured indebtedness. 
 Our third amended and restated credit facility, the notes issued under our note purchase agreements and our amended and restated term loan agreement and our 3.375 senior notes due 2031 represent unsecured indebtedness. The holders of our secured debt may foreclose on the assets securing such debt, reducing the cash flow from the foreclosed property available for payment of unsecured debt. The holders of any of our secured debt also would have priority over unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding. 
 If we invest in mortgage receivables, including originating mortgages, such investment would be subject to several risks, any of which could decrease the value of such investments and result in a significant loss to us. 
 From time to time, we may invest in mortgage receivables, including originating mortgages. In general, investments in mortgages are subject to several risks, including: 
 borrowers may fail to make debt service payments or pay the principal when due, which may make it necessary for us to foreclose our mortgages or engage in costly negotiations; 
 the value of the mortgaged property may be less than the principal amount of the mortgage note securing the property; 
 interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost for the funds to acquire these mortgages; and 
 
 14 

the mortgages may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens, in which case we would need to make payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it in its entirety to protect such mortgage investment. 
 If any of these risks were to be realized, the total amount we would recover from our mortgage receivables may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss and our mortgage receivables may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole, including dislocations in the credit markets. These conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock as a result of the following potential consequences, among others: 
 decreased demand for office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use space, which would cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; 
 our ability to obtain financing on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense; and 
 one or more lenders under our third amended and restated credit facility could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all. 
 We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment, such as weakness in the economy, the level of consumer spending, the adverse financial condition of large retailing companies and competition from discount and internet retailers, any of which could adversely affect market rents for retail space and the willingness or ability of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers. 
 A portion of our properties are in the retail real estate market. This means that we are subject to factors that affect the retail sector generally, as well as the market for retail space. The retail environment and the market for retail space have previously been, and could again be, adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies, inflation, high interest rate environments, the level of consumer spending and consumer confidence, the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets, increasing competition from discount retailers, outlet malls, internet retailers (including Amazon.com) and other online businesses and the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially other communicable diseases. Increases in consumer spending via the internet may significantly affect our retail tenants' ability to generate sales in their stores and could affect the way future tenants lease space. In addition, some of our retail tenants face competition from the expanding market for digital content and hardware. New and enhanced technologies, including new digital technologies and new web services technologies, may increase competition for certain of our retail tenants. While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyze and respond to tenant trends, preferences and consumer spending patterns, we cannot predict with certainty what future tenants will want, what future retail spaces will look like and how much revenue will be generated at traditional brick and mortar locations. If we are unable to anticipate and respond promptly to trends in the market, our occupancy levels and rental amounts may decline. We also might be susceptible to weakness in retail real estate as a result of trends relating to consumers preference to utilize e-commerce in lieu of in-person shopping experiences. 
 Any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers. In turn, these conditions could negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 We face significant competition in the leasing market, which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. 
 We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current 
 
 15 

market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our tenants' leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 We may be required to make rent or other concessions and/or significant capital expenditures to improve our properties in order to retain and attract tenants, causing our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock to be adversely affected. 
 We may be required, upon expiration of leases at our properties, to make rent or other concessions to tenants, accommodate requests for renovations, build-to-suit remodeling and other improvements or provide additional services to our tenants. As a result, we may have to make significant capital or other expenditures in order to retain tenants whose leases expire and to attract new tenants in sufficient numbers. Additionally, we may need to raise capital to make such expenditures. If we are unable to do so or capital is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to make the required expenditures. This could result in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases, which could cause an adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 The actual rents we receive for the properties in our portfolio may be less than our asking rents, and we may experience lease roll down from time to time, which could negatively impact our ability to generate cash flow growth. 
 As a result of various factors, including competitive pricing pressure in our submarkets, adverse conditions in the California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii real estate markets and the desirability of our properties compared to other properties in our submarkets, we may be unable to realize the asking rents across the properties in our portfolio. In addition, the degree of discrepancy between our asking rents and the actual rents we are able to obtain may vary both from property to property and among different leased spaces within a single property. If we are unable to obtain rental rates that are on average comparable to our asking rents across our portfolio, then our ability to generate cash flow growth will be negatively impacted. In addition, depending on asking rental rates at any given time as compared to expiring leases in our portfolio, from time to time rental rates for expiring leases may be higher than starting rental rates for new leases. 
 We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets. 
 In the future we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in our Operating Partnership, which may result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of Operating Partnership units that may be exchanged for shares of our common stock. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties. Similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. 
 We are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality and tourism industries, including competition for guests with other hospitality properties and general and local economic conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, any of which could adversely affect the revenues generated by our hospitality or other properties. 
 Because we own the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites in Hawaii and the Santa Fe Park RV Resort in California, we are susceptible to risks associated with the hospitality industry, including: 
 competition for guests with other hospitality properties, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than the managers of our hospitality properties; 
 increases in operating costs from inflation, labor costs (including the impact of unionization), workers' compensation and healthcare related costs, utility costs, insurance and other factors that the managers of our hospitality properties may not be able to offset through higher rates; 
 the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism, which seasonality may cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues; 
 general and local economic conditions that may affect demand for travel in general; 
 periodic oversupply resulting from excessive new development; 
 unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel-related health concerns, including pandemics and epidemics, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel-related 
 
 16 

accidents, climate change and unusual weather patterns, including natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes; and 
 decreased reimbursement revenue from the licensor for traveler reward programs. 
 If our hospitality properties do not generate sufficient revenues, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders may be adversely affected. 
 In addition, because tourism is a major component of both the local economies in Hawaii and California, our properties in California and Hawaii may be impacted by the local and global tourism industry. These properties are susceptible to any factors that affect travel and tourism related to Hawaii and California, including cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air or other travel to and from these regions. Moreover, these properties may be affected by risks such as acts of terrorism and natural disasters, including major fires, floods and earthquakes, as well as severe or inclement weather, which could also decrease tourism activity in Hawaii or California. 
 We must rely on third-party management companies to operate the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, and, as a result, we will have less control than if we were operating the hotel directly. 
 In order to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we have leased the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites to WBW Hotel Lessee, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of our taxable REIT subsidiary), or the TRS Lessee, and engaged a third-party management company to operate our hotel. While we have some input into operating decisions for the hotel leased by our TRS Lessee and operated under a management agreement, we have less control than if we managed the hotel ourselves. Even if we believe that our hotel is not being operated efficiently, we may not have sufficient rights under the management agreement to enable us to force the management company to change its method of operation. We cannot assure you that the management company will successfully manage our hotel. A failure by the management company to successfully manage the hotel could lead to an increase in our operating expenses or a decrease in our revenue, or both, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and our ability to pay distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 If our relationship with the franchisor of the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites was to deteriorate or terminate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 We cannot assure you that disputes between us and the franchisor of the Waikiki Beach Walk- Embassy Suites will not arise. If our relationship with the franchisor were to deteriorate as a result of disputes regarding the franchise agreement under which our hotel operates or for other reasons, the franchisor could, under certain circumstances, terminate our current license with them or decline to provide licenses for hotels that we may acquire in the future. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 Our franchisor, Embassy Suites , could cause us to expend additional funds on upgraded operating standards, which may adversely affect our results of operations and reduce cash available for distribution to stockholders and unitholders. 
 Under the terms of our franchise license agreement, our hotel operator must comply with operating standards and terms and conditions imposed by the franchisor of the hotel brand, Embassy Suites . Failure by us, our TRS Lessees or any hotel management company that we engage to maintain these standards or other terms and conditions could result in the franchise license being canceled or the franchisor requiring us to undertake a costly property improvement program. If the franchise license is terminated due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we may be liable to the franchisor for a termination payment, which we expect could be as high as approximately 7.7 million based on operating performance through December 31, 2023. In addition, our franchisor may impose upgraded or new brand standards, such as substantially upgrading the bedding, enhancing the complimentary breakfast or increasing the value of guest awards under its frequent guest program, which can add substantial expense for the hotel. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the franchisor may require us to make certain capital improvements to maintain the hotel in accordance with system standards, the cost of which can be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations and reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and unitholders. 
 
 17 

Embassy Suites , our franchisor, has a right of first offer with respect to the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites , which may limit our ability to obtain the highest price possible for the hotel. 
 Pursuant to the terms of our franchise agreement for the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites , the franchisor has a right of first offer to purchase the hotel if we propose to sell all or a portion of the hotel or any interest therein. In the event that we choose to dispose of the hotel, we would be required to notify the franchisor, prior to offering the hotel to any other potential buyer, of the price and conditions on which we would be willing to sell the hotel, and the franchisor would have the right, within 30 days of receiving such notice, to make an offer to purchase the hotel. If the franchisor makes an offer to purchase that is equal to or greater than the price and on substantially the same terms set forth in our notice, then we will be obligated to sell the hotel to the franchisor at that price and on those terms. If the franchisor makes an offer to purchase for less than the price stated in our notice or on less favorable terms, then we may reject the franchisor's offer. The existence of this right of first offer could adversely impact our ability to obtain the highest possible price for the hotel as, during the term of the franchise agreement, we would not be able to offer the hotel to potential purchasers through a competitive bid process or in a similar manner designed to maximize the value obtained for the property without first offering to sell this property to the franchisor. 
 Our real estate development activities are subject to risks particular to development, such as unanticipated expenses, delays and other contingencies, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 We may engage in development and redevelopment activities with respect to certain of our properties. To the extent that we do so, we will be subject to the following risks associated with such development and redevelopment activities: 
 unsuccessful development or redevelopment opportunities could result in direct expenses to us; 
 construction or redevelopment costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or unprofitable; 
 time required to complete the construction or redevelopment of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity; 
 contractor and subcontractor disputes, strikes, labor disputes or supply disruptions; 
 failure to achieve expected occupancy and/or rent levels within the projected time frame, if at all; 
 delays with respect to obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary zoning, occupancy, land use and other governmental permits, and changes in zoning and land use laws; 
 occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable; 
 our ability to dispose of properties developed or redeveloped with the intent to sell could be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing given the current state of the credit markets; and 
 the availability and pricing of financing to fund our development activities on favorable terms or at all. 
 These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of development or redevelopment activities once undertaken, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed, and the loss of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and to implement our growth strategies, or could create a negative perception in the capital markets. 
 Our continued success and our ability to manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of key personnel, particularly Messrs. Rady, Barton and Wyll who have extensive market knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, acquisition and disposition activity. Among the reasons that these individuals are important to our success is that each has a national or regional industry reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants and industry personnel. If we lose their services, our relationships with such personnel could diminish. 
 Our Board has implemented an emergency succession plan in case of the sudden or unanticipated resignation, termination, death or temporary or permanent disability of Mr. Rady, or otherwise in case Mr. Rady is unable to perform his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This plan is reviewed at least annually by our Board with input from our Nominating and Governance Committee and currently includes Dr. Robert Sullivan (Board member), Mr. Barton and Mr. Wyll, as potential interim candidates for the roles of Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer and/or as emergency interim executive committee members. 
 
 18 

Many of our other senior executives also have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry, which aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and industry participants, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Mr. Rady is involved in outside businesses, which may interfere with his ability to devote time and attention to our business and affairs. 
 We rely on our senior management team, including Mr. Rady, for the day-to-day operations of our business. Our employment agreement with Mr. Rady requires him to devote a substantial portion of his business time and attention to our business. Mr. Rady continues to serve as our chairman of the board of directors and president of American Assets, Inc. and chairman of the board of directors of Insurance Company of the West. As such, Mr. Rady has certain ongoing duties to American Assets, Inc., Insurance Company of the West and other business ventures that could require a portion of his time and attention. Although we expect that Mr. Rady will continue to devote a majority of his business time and attention to us, we cannot accurately predict the amount of time and attention that will be required of Mr. Rady to perform such ongoing duties. To the extent that Mr. Rady is required to dedicate time and attention to American Assets, Inc. and/or Insurance Company of the West, his ability to devote a majority of his business time and attention to our business and affairs may be limited and could adversely affect our operations. 
 We may be subject to on-going or future litigation and otherwise in the ordinary course of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 We may be subject to on-going litigation at our properties and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves; however, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of currently asserted claims or of those that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby having an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and/or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors. 
 Potential losses from earthquakes in California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii may not be fully covered by insurance. 
 Many of the properties we currently own are located in California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii, which are areas especially subject to earthquakes. While we carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties, the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from earthquakes and will be subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments. In addition, we may reduce or discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any such policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. As a result, in the event of an earthquake, we may be required to incur significant costs, and, to the extent that a loss exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. 
 We may be adversely affected by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change. 
 We may become subject to laws or regulations related to climate change, which could cause our business, results of operations and financial condition to be impacted adversely. The federal government has enacted, and some of the states and localities in which we operate may enact, certain climate change laws and regulations or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. Although these laws and regulations have not had any known material adverse effects on our business to date, they could result in substantial costs, including compliance costs, increased energy costs, retrofit costs and construction costs, including monitoring and reporting costs, and capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. Furthermore, our reputation could be negatively affected if we violate climate change laws or regulations. We cannot predict how future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of current laws and regulations, related to climate change will affect our properties, business, results of operations and financial condition. Lastly, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in 
 
 19 

areas in which we operate. These may include changes global weather patterns, which could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperature averages or extremes. These impacts may adversely affect our properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Climate change may adversely impact our properties directly, and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees . 
 We cannot reliably predict the extent, rate, or impact of climate change. As such, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate. These may include changes in global weather patterns, which could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperature averages or extremes. Further, population migration may occur in response to these or other factors and negatively impact our properties. Climate and other environmental changes may result in volatile or decreased demand for space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate certain properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance, or making insurance unavailable. Although we strive to identify, analyze, and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents, at this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have an adverse effect on the value of our properties and our financial performance. 
 Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. 
 A significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, tornadoes, wildfires, and sea-level rise due to climate change, and other natural disasters. At December 31, 2023, 57 of the gross leaseable area of our portfolio is located in the State of California. Additionally, 14 , 13 , and 8 of the gross leaseable area of our portfolio is located in the States of Washington, Oregon and Texas, respectively, and we have a meaningful presence in Oahu, Hawaii. Insurance costs for properties in these areas have increased, and recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future. We recognize that the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase. These weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas. Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs, such as uninsured property losses, higher insurance premiums, and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks. 
 We may not be able to rebuild our existing properties to their existing specifications if we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of such properties. 
 In the event that we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications. Further, reconstruction or improvement of such a property would likely require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code requirements. Environmental and legal restrictions could also restrict the rebuilding of our properties. For example, if we experienced a substantial or comprehensive loss of our Torrey Reserve Campus in San Diego, California, reconstruction could be delayed or prevented by the California Coastal Commission, which regulates land use in the California coastal zone. 
 
 Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on co-venturers' financial condition and disputes between us and our co-venturers. 
 We may co-invest in the future with other third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Consequently, with respect to any such arrangement we may enter into in the future, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives, and they may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. In addition, a sale or transfer by us to a third-party of our interests in the joint venture may be subject to consent rights or rights of first refusal, in favor of our joint venture partners, which would in each case restrict our 
 
 20 

ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture. Where we are a limited partner or non-managing member in any partnership or limited liability company, if such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers. Our joint ventures may be subject to debt and, in the current volatile credit market, the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls. 
 Increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our residents, lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents at our multifamily apartment communities. 
 Our multifamily apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including other multifamily apartment communities and single-family rental homes, as well as owner occupied single and multifamily homes. Competitive housing in a particular area and an increase in the affordability of owner occupied single and multifamily homes due to, among other things, housing prices, oversupply, mortgage interest rates and tax incentives and government programs to promote home ownership, could adversely affect our ability to retain residents, lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents. 
 Our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control and may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could limit our ability, among other things, to meet our capital and operating needs or make the cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Code, among other things, to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financing, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we intend to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all and any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage and likelihood of default. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on: 
 general market conditions; 
 the market's perception of our growth potential; 
 our current debt levels; 
 our current and expected future earnings; 
 our cash flow and cash distributions; and 
 the market price per share of our common stock. 
 If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 We rely on information technology in our operations, and are subject to laws and regulations concerning data privacy and security. Any breach, interruption or security failure of that technology or any failure to comply with applicable laws could have a negative impact on our business, operations and/or financial condition. 
 Information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. We rely on the reasonable secure processing of personal, confidential and other sensitive information in our computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online sites and networks as well as those provided by third parties (collectively, IT Systems ). Our IT Systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. We and our third-party providers face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, bugs, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails and/or employees or third-parties with access to our IT Systems, all of which create an ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems and data that we and our providers process. We face the risk of ransomware or other cyberattacks aimed at disrupting the availability of systems, applications, networks or data important to our business operations. Threat actors use increasingly sophisticated techniques and tools including artificial intelligence that circumvent security controls, evade detection and remove forensic evidence. Further, we offer the flexibility to work remotely in certain limited circumstances, which introduces heightened cybersecurity risks as remote working environments can 
 
 21 

be less secure and more susceptible to cyberattacks due to cybersecurity risks associated with managing remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in many non-corporate and home networks. 
 We mitigate the risk of disruptions, breaches or disclosure of this personal, confidential personally and other sensitive information by implementing a variety of security measures including (among others) engaging reputable, recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems, and to test and verify their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis. However, we cannot guarantee that we or our providers will not suffer successful security breaches, cyberattacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, human error issues or other similar events. Like many companies, we have experienced and will continue to experience incidents. Although none of these actual or attempted cyberattacks has had a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we cannot guarantee that any such incidents will not have such an impact in the future. 
 There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability and controls of our (or our third-party service providers') IT networks and related data and systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our (or our third-party service providers') IT networks and related systems could materially and adversely impact our income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the ability to service our debt obligations, the market price of our common stock, our ability to pay dividends and/or other distributions to our shareholders and unitholders. A security breach could additionally cause the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information of our residents and/or employees), resulting in litigation (including class actions) and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries, investigations or actions, and damage to our reputation. Although we maintain errors or omissions and cyber liability insurance, the costs related to an incident or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means and insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all. We also cannot guarantee that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. 
 Additionally, as part of our normal business activities,we collect and hold personal information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities at our multifamily locations. We also collect and hold personal information of our employees in connection with their employment. As such, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and industry standards. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements that are subject to differing interpretations. In the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules and regulations governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, transmission and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws and consumer protection laws. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, and could cause our customers and consumers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. 
 Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry 
 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and the real estate industry, including local oversupply, reduction in demand or adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties, which could decrease revenues or increase costs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our ability to make expected distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders depends on our ability to generate revenues in excess of expenses, scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements. Events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties. These events include many of the risks set forth above under Risks Related to Our Business and Operations, as well as the following: 
 local oversupply or reduction in demand for office, retail, multifamily or mixed-use space; 
 adverse changes in financial conditions of buyers, sellers and tenants of properties; 
 vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms, including possible market pressures to offer tenants rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below market renewal options, and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space; 
 increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes and state and local taxes; 
 a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential residents of our multifamily apartment communities deciding to purchase homes instead of renting; 
 rent control or stabilization laws, or other laws regulating rental housing, which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs; 
 
 22 

civil unrest, acts of war, terrorist attacks, pandemics and natural disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses; 
 decreases in the underlying value of our real estate; 
 changing submarket demographics; and 
 changing traffic patterns. 
 In addition, periods of economic downturn or recession, inflation, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition. 
 The real estate investments made, and to be made, by us are relatively difficult to sell quickly. As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. Return of capital and realization of gains, if any, from an investment generally will occur upon disposition or refinancing of the underlying property. We may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale, other disposition or refinancing at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. In particular, our ability to dispose of one or more properties within a specific time period is subject to weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in national or international economic conditions, such as the recent economic downturn, and changes in laws, regulations or fiscal policies of jurisdictions in which the property is located. 
 In addition, the Code imposes restrictions on a REIT's ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. In particular, the tax laws applicable to REITs effectively require that we hold our properties for investment, rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, which may cause us to forgo or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest. Therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Our property taxes could increase due to property tax rate changes or reassessment, which would adversely impact our cash flows. 
 Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will be required to pay some state and local taxes on our properties. The real property taxes on our properties may increase as property tax rates change or as our properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. If the property taxes we pay increase, our cash flow would be adversely impacted, and our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders and unitholders could be adversely affected. 
 As an owner of real estate, we could incur significant costs and liabilities related to environmental matters. 
 Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate, clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. 
 Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property, or adjacent properties, for commercial or industrial purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. For example, Del Monte Center is currently undergoing the final stages of remediation of dry cleaning solvent contamination from a former onsite dry cleaner, which entails the long term ground monitoring by the appropriate regulatory agency over the next five to seven years. The prior owner of Del Monte Center entered into a fixed fee environmental services agreement in 1997 pursuant to which the 
 
 23 

remediation will be completed for approximately 3.5 million, with the remediation costs paid for through funds held in an escrow account funded by the prior owner. We expect that the funds in this escrow account will cover all remaining costs and expenses of the environmental remediation. However, if the Regional Water Quality Control Board - Central Coast Region were to require further work costing more than the remaining escrowed funds, we could be required to pay such overage although we may have a claim for such costs against the prior owner or our environmental remediation consultant. In addition to the foregoing, we possess Phase I Environmental Site Assessments for certain of the properties in our portfolio, these assessments are limited in scope (e.g., they do not generally include soil sampling, subsurface investigations or hazardous materials survey) and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. Furthermore, we do not have Phase I Environmental Site Assessment reports for all of the properties in our portfolio and, as such, we may not be aware of all potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities at the properties in our portfolio. As a result, we could potentially incur material liability for these issues, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 As the owner of the buildings on our properties, we could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in our buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if we do not comply with such laws, we could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, we could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in our buildings, and we could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in our buildings. In addition, some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant's ability to make rental payments to us, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations, or those of our tenants, which could in turn have an adverse effect on us. 
 We cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental issues will not affect our ability to make distributions to you or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. If we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, we may face significant remediation costs, and we may find it difficult to sell any affected properties. 
 Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. 
 When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury is alleged to have occurred. 
 We may incur significant costs complying with various federal, state and local laws, regulations and covenants that are applicable to our properties. 
 The properties in our portfolio are subject to various covenants and federal, state and local laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting and licensing requirements. Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials of community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. Among other things, these restrictions may relate to fire and safety, seismic or hazardous material abatement requirements. There can be no assurance that existing laws and regulatory policies will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or renovations, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs. Our growth strategy may be affected by our ability to obtain permits, licenses and zoning relief. Our failure to obtain such permits, licenses and zoning relief or to comply with applicable laws could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 
 24 

In addition, federal and state laws and regulations, including laws such as the ADA and the FHAA, impose further restrictions on our properties and operations. Under the ADA and the FHAA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Some of our properties may currently be in non-compliance with the ADA or the FHAA. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA, the FHAA or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance and we might incur governmental fines or be required to pay damages to private litigants. In addition, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure 
 Ernest S. Rady and his affiliates, directly or indirectly, own a substantial beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis and have the ability to exercise significant influence on our company and our Operating Partnership, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. 
 As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Rady and his affiliates owned approximately 16.6 of our outstanding common stock and 19.39 of our outstanding common units, which together represent an approximate 35.8 beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis. Consequently, Mr. Rady may be able to significantly influence the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder action, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, including business combinations, consolidations and mergers. In addition, we may not, without prior limited partner approval, directly or indirectly transfer all or any portion of our interest in the Operating Partnership before the later of the death of Mr. Rady and the death of his wife, in connection with a merger, consolidation or other combination of our assets with another entity, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, a reclassification, recapitalization or change in any outstanding shares of our stock or other outstanding equity interests or an issuance of shares of our stock, in any case that requires approval by our common stockholders. As a result, Mr. Rady has substantial influence on us and could exercise his influence in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders. 
 Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of units in our Operating Partnership, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders. 
 Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our company under Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we, as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, have fiduciary duties and obligations to our Operating Partnership and its limited partners under Maryland law and pursuant to the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our fiduciary duties and obligations as the general partner of our Operating Partnership may conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company. 
 Under Maryland law, a general partner of a Maryland limited partnership has fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the partnership and its partners and must discharge its duties and exercise its rights as general partner under the partnership agreement or Maryland law consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The partnership agreement provides that, in the event of a conflict between the interests of our Operating Partnership or any partner, on the one hand, and the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, on the other hand, we, in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, are under no obligation not to give priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders, and that any action or failure to act on our part or on the part of our directors that gives priority to the separate interests of our company or our stockholders that does not result in a violation of the contract rights of the limited partners of the Operating Partnership under its partnership agreement does not violate the duty of loyalty that we, in our capacity as the general partner of our Operating Partnership, owe to the Operating Partnership and its partners. 
 Additionally, the partnership agreement provides that we will not be liable to the Operating Partnership or any partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the Operating Partnership or any limited partner, except for liability for our intentional harm or gross negligence. Our Operating Partnership must indemnify us, our directors and officers, officers of our Operating Partnership and our designees from and against any and all claims that relate to the operations of our Operating Partnership, unless (1) an act or omission of the person was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2) the person actually received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of the partnership agreement or (3) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the indemnified person had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Our Operating Partnership must also pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses of any such person upon its receipt of a written affirmation of the person's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay any amounts paid or advanced if it is ultimately determined that the person did not meet the standard of conduct for indemnification. Our Operating Partnership will not indemnify or advance funds to any person with respect to any action 
 
 25 

initiated by the person seeking indemnification without our approval (except for any proceeding brought to enforce such person's right to indemnification under the partnership agreement) or if the person is found to be liable to our Operating Partnership on any portion of any claim in the action. No reported decision of a Maryland appellate court has interpreted provisions similar to the provisions of the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership that modify and reduce our fiduciary duties or obligations as the general partner or reduce or eliminate our liability for money damages to the Operating Partnership and its partners, and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel as to the enforceability of the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to modify or reduce the fiduciary duties that would be in effect were it not for the partnership agreement. 
 Our charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership and Maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. 
 Our charter contains certain ownership limits with respect to our stock. Our charter, subject to certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take such actions as it determines are advisable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Our charter also prohibits the actual, beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 7.275 in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than 7.275 in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, excluding any shares that are not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes. Our board of directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may exempt a person, prospectively or retroactively, from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied. Our board of directors has granted to each of (1) Mr. Rady (and certain of his affiliates), (2) Cohen Steers Management, Inc. and (3) BlackRock, Inc. an exemption from the ownership limits that will allow them to own, in the aggregate, up to 19.9 , 10.0 and 10.0 , respectively, in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock, subject to various conditions and limitations. The restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may (a) discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests; or (b) result in the transfer of shares acquired in excess of the restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and, as a result, the forfeiture by the acquirer of the benefits of owning the additional shares. 
 We could increase the number of authorized shares of stock, classify and reclassify unissued stock and issue stock without stockholder approval. 
 Our board of directors, without stockholder approval, has the power under our charter to amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we are authorized to issue, to authorize us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock and set the terms of such newly classified or reclassified shares. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers and rights, voting or otherwise, that are senior to, or otherwise conflict with, the rights of holders of our common stock. Although our board of directors has no such intention at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including (1) business combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof or an affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose fair price and/or supermajority and stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and (2) control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company (defined as shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares have no voting rights with respect to their 
 
 26 

control shares, except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. As permitted by the MGCL, our board of directors has, by board resolution, elected to opt out of the business combination provisions of the MGCL. However, we cannot assure you that our board of directors will not opt to be subject to such business combination provisions of the MGCL in the future. 
 Certain provisions of the MGCL permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions, some of which (e.g., a classified board) are not currently applicable to us. These provisions may have the effect of limiting or precluding a third-party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. Our charter contains a provision whereby we elected to be subject to certain provisions the MGCL relating to the filling of vacancies on our board of directors. 
 Certain provisions in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us. 
 Provisions in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership may delay, or make more difficult, unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others: 
 redemption rights of qualifying parties; 
 a requirement that we may not be removed as the general partner of our Operating Partnership without our consent; 
 transfer restrictions on common units; 
 our ability, as general partner, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the Operating Partnership to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change of control of us or our Operating Partnership without the consent of the limited partners; and 
 the right of the limited partners to consent to direct or indirect transfers of the general partnership interest, including as a result of a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, in the event that such transfer requires approval by our common stockholders. 
 In particular, we may not, without prior partnership approval, directly or indirectly transfer all or any portion of our interest in our Operating Partnership, before the later of the death of Mr. Rady and the death of his wife, in connection with a merger, consolidation or other combination of our assets with another entity, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, a reclassification, recapitalization or change in any outstanding shares of our stock or other outstanding equity interests or an issuance of shares of our stock, in any case that requires approval by our common stockholders. The partnership approval requirement is satisfied, with respect to such a transfer, when the sum of (1) the percentage interest of limited partners consenting to the transfer of our interest, plus (2) the product of (a) the percentage of the outstanding common units held by us multiplied by (b) the percentage of the votes that were cast in favor of the event by our common stockholders equals or exceeds the percentage required for our common stockholders to approve the event resulting in the transfer. As of December 31, 2023, the limited partners, including Mr. Rady and his affiliates and our other executive officers and directors, owned approximately 22.8 of our outstanding common units and approximately 22.5 of our outstanding common stock, which together represent an approximate 38.8 beneficial interest in our company on a fully diluted basis. 
 Our charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. 
 Our board of directors may change our investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and we may become more highly leveraged, which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations. 
 Our investment and financing policies are exclusively determined by our board of directors. Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies. Further, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that we may incur. Our board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. If this policy changed, we could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in our debt service. Higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations. In addition, a change in our investment policies, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest, may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, real estate market fluctuations and liquidity risk. Changes to our policies with regards to the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 
 27 

Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited. 
 As permitted by Maryland law, our charter eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from (1) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or (2) a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated. 
 As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our company, your ability to recover damages from such director or officer will be limited. 
 We are a holding company with no direct operations and, as such, we will rely on funds received from our Operating Partnership to pay liabilities, and the interests of our stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities and obligations of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. 
 We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our Operating Partnership. We do not have, apart from an interest in our Operating Partnership, any independent operations. As a result, we rely on distributions from our Operating Partnership to pay any dividends we might declare on shares of our common stock. We also rely on distributions from our Operating Partnership to meet our obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from our Operating Partnership. In addition, because we are a holding company, claims of stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and our Operating Partnership's and its subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. 
 Our Operating Partnership may issue additional partnership units to third parties without the consent of our stockholders, which would reduce our ownership percentage in our Operating Partnership and would have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to us by our Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 We may, in connection with our acquisition of properties or otherwise, issue additional partnership units to third parties. Such issuances would reduce our ownership percentage in our Operating Partnership and affect the amount of distributions made to us by our Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. To the extent that our stockholders do not directly own partnership units, our stockholders will not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of our Operating Partnership. 
 Our operating structure subjects us to the risk of increased hotel operating expenses. 
 Our lease with our TRS Lessee requires our TRS Lessee to pay us rent based in part on revenues from the Waikiki Beach Walk-Embassy Suites . Our operating risks include decreases in hotel revenues and increases in hotel operating expenses, which would adversely affect our TRS Lessee's ability to pay us rent due under the lease, including but not limited to the increases in: 
 wage and benefit costs; 
 repair and maintenance expenses; 
 energy costs; 
 property taxes; 
 insurance costs; and 
 other operating expenses. 
 Increases in these operating expenses can have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 Future sales of common stock or common units by our directors and officers, or their pledgees, as a result of margin calls or foreclosures could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could, in the future, result in a loss of control of our company. 
 Our directors and officers may pledge shares of common stock or common units owned or controlled by them as collateral for loans or for margin purposes in favor of third parties. Depending on the status of the various loan obligations for which the stock or units ultimately serve as collateral and the trading price of our common stock, our directors and/or officers, 
 
 28 

and their affiliates, may experience a foreclosure or margin call that could result in the sale of the pledged stock or units, in the open market or otherwise. Unlike for our directors and officers, sales by these pledgees may not be subject to the volume limitations of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. A sale of pledged stock or units by pledgees could result in a loss of control of our company, depending upon the number of shares of stock or units sold and the ownership interests of other stockholders. In addition, sale of these shares or units, or the perception of possible future sales, could have a materially adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities. 
 Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT 
 Failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock. 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and believe we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, that we qualify as a REIT. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to you for each of the years involved because: 
 we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to the regular U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (and we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018); 
 we also could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and 
 unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. 
 Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. In addition, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders. As a result of all these factors, our failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could materially and adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable Treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the Code, or the Treasury Regulations, is greater in the case of a REIT that, like us, holds its assets through a partnership. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets and requirements regarding the sources of our gross income. Also, we must make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially adversely affect our investors, our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. 
 Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to some federal, state and local income, property and excise taxes on our income or property and, in certain cases, a 100 penalty tax, in the event we sell property as a dealer. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be subject to tax as regular corporations in the jurisdictions they operate. 
 If our Operating Partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. 
 We believe that our Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, our Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, its share of our Operating Partnership's income. We cannot be assured, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of our Operating Partnership or any other subsidiary partnership in which we own an interest, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating our Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary partnership as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of our Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships to qualify as a partnership could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income 
 
 29 

tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including us. 
 The asset tests applicable to REITs limit our ability to own taxable REIT subsidiaries, and we will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our taxable REIT subsidiaries are not conducted on arm's length terms. 
 We own an interest in one taxable REIT subsidiary and may acquire securities in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. A taxable REIT subsidiary is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a taxable REIT subsidiary owns more than 35 of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a taxable REIT subsidiary may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100 excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a taxable REIT subsidiary and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis. 
 Not more than 20 of the value of a REIT s total assets may be represented by the securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. A REIT's ownership of securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary is not subject to the 5 or 10 asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more than 25 of a REIT's total assets may be represented by securities (including securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries), other than those securities includable in the 75 asset test. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other nonqualifying assets will be less than 25 of the value of our total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure our transactions with our taxable REIT subsidiaries to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with these ownership limitations or to avoid application of the 100 excise tax discussed above. 
 To maintain our REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions, and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 To maintain our REIT status, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we will be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year, including net capital gains. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. In order to maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from, among other things, differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. These sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, the market price of our common stock, and our current and potential future earnings. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock. 
 We may in the future choose to make dividends payable partly in our common stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive. 
 To maintain our REIT status, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains. In order to preserve cash to repay debt or for other reasons, we may choose to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements by distributing taxable dividends that are payable partly in our stock and partly in cash. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our 
 
 30 

stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales may have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of our common stock. 
 Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. 
 The maximum tax rate applicable to dividends treated as qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20 . Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the 20 rate. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock. Non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct 20 of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, such stockholders may not claim this deduction with respect to dividends paid by us. 
 The tax imposed on REITs engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. 
 A REIT's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. 
 Complying with REIT requirements may affect our profitability and may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the nature and diversification of our assets, the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. We may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions. We also may be required to make distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. As a result, having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to: (1) sell assets in adverse market conditions; (2) borrow on unfavorable terms; or (3) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. Accordingly, satisfying the REIT requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results, profitability and ability to execute our business plan. Moreover, if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset, income or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to REITs or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions. 
 Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on our investors or us, including our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. 
 The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. 
 Pandemics and related governmental or business restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental and business restrictions intended to prevent the viruses spread had a significant adverse impact on economic and market conditions around the world, including in the United States and specifically in the markets in which we own properties. Whether we will experience another pandemic or similar health-related crisis and if so, the extent and duration of any governmental or business measures aimed to contain such illness, such as quarantines, 
 
 31 

restrictions on travel, stay-at-home orders, density limitations, social distancing measures, restrictions on business operations and/or construction projects, is highly unpredictable. As a result, we may not be able to avoid another pandemic s adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. For instance, we previously saw a material reduction in rent collections from certain tenants, particularly retail tenants, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and business measures. 
 The impact of a future pandemic could have significant adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders in a variety of ways that are difficult to predict. Such adverse impacts could depend on, among other factors: 
 
 the financial condition of our tenants and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full on a timely basis; 
 state, local, federal and industry-initiated efforts that may adversely affect landlords, including us, and their ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent; 
 our need to defer or forgive rent and restructure leases with our tenants and our ability to do so on favorable terms or at all; 
 significant job losses in the industries of our tenants, which may decrease demand for our office and retail space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 increased working from home, which may decrease demand for office space causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 our ability to stabilize our development projects, renew leases or re-lease available space in our proprieties on favorable terms or at all, including as a result of a general decrease in demand for our office and retail space and occupancy in our hotel, deterioration in the economic and market conditions in the markets in which we own properties or due to pandemic-related restrictions that frustrate our leasing activities; 
 a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, all of which have already experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility, or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions, may affect our or our tenants ability to access capital necessary to fund our respective business operations or replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, on attractive terms or at all and may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could affect our and our tenants ability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements; 
 a refusal or failure of one or more lenders under our revolving line of credit to fund their respective financing commitments to us may affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our business operations and to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements; 
 the ability of potential buyers of properties identified for potential future capital recycling transactions to obtain debt financing, which has been and may continue to be constrained for some potential buyers; 
 a reduction in the values of our properties that could result in impairments or limit our ability to dispose of them at attractive prices or obtain debt financing secured by our properties; 
 complete or partial shutdowns of one or more of our tenants manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruptions in our tenants supply chains from local, national and international suppliers or delays in the delivery of products, services or other materials necessary for our tenants operations, which could force our tenants to reduce, delay or eliminate offerings of their products and services, reduce or eliminate their revenues and liquidity and/or result in their bankruptcy or insolvency; 
 our ability to avoid delays or cost increases associated with building materials or construction services necessary for construction that could adversely impact our ability to continue or complete construction as planned, on budget or at all; 
 our and our tenants ability to manage our respective businesses to the extent our and their management or personnel are impacted in significant numbers by a pandemic and are not willing, available or allowed to conduct work; 
 certain of our tenants filing for bankruptcy due to financial hardships they suffered as a result of a pandemic; and 
 our and our tenants ability to ensure business continuity in the event our continuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented or deployed to the extent necessary due to the unpredictable impacts of a pandemic. 
 The continuing, unpredictable development of the impacts of COVID-19, restrictions intended to prevent its spread, and the volatile financial, economic and capital markets environment present material risks and uncertainties with respect to our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders and could also have a material adverse effect on the market value of our securities.

 Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy 
 
 We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan. 
 Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. 
 Our cybersecurity risk management program includes: 
 risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise information technology IT environment; 
 a team of employees (as further described below), or our Response Team responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents; 
 the use of reputable, recognized external service providers that assess, test and otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity controls; 
 periodic cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; 
 an incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and 
 a risk management process with respect to IT-related third-party service providers. 
 
 We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other IT risks. The Audit Committee reviews and approves our cybersecurity risk management program. 
 The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential. 
 The Audit Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our President and Chief Operating Officer or external experts as part of the Board s continuing education on topics that impact public companies. 
 Our Response Team is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats, has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our Response Team includes our President and Chief Operating Officer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, our Director of IT, our Business Systems Manager, our Corporate Controller and our Director of Internal Audit. The Response Team members' relevant experience includes overseeing IT departments, reviewing existing security measures, and implementing solutions to mitigate security risks that may pose threats to a business. 
 Our Response Team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including third-party consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.

 (1) Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying base rental payments (defined as cash base rents (before abatements)) under commenced leases for the month ended December 31, 2023 by 12. In the case of triple net or modified gross leases, annualized base rent does not include tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area or other operating expenses. The foregoing notwithstanding: 
 a. The annualized base rent for La Jolla Commons has been adjusted for this presentation to reflect that the contractual triple net leases were instead structured as modified gross leases, by adding the contractual annualized triple net base rent of 35,743,797 to our estimate of annual triple net operating expenses of 10,507,904 for an estimated annualized base rent on a modified gross lease basis of 46,251,701 for La Jolla Commons. 
 b. The annualized base rent for Eastgate Office Park has been adjusted for this presentation to reflect that the contractual triple net leases were instead structured as modified gross leases, by adding the contractual annualized triple net base rent of 4,656,039 to our estimate of annual triple net operating expenses of 1,819,424 for an estimated annualized base rent on a modified gross lease basis of 6,475,463 for Eastgate Office Park. 
 c. The annualized base rent for Corporate Campus East III has been adjusted for this presentation to reflect that the contractual triple net leases were instead structured as modified gross leases, by adding the contractual annualized triple net base rent of 4,508,259 to our estimate of annual triple net operating expenses of 1,745,372 for an estimated annualized base rent on a modified gross lease basis of 6,253,631 for Corporate Campus East III. 
 d. The annualized base rent for Bel-Spring 520 has been adjusted for this presentation to reflect that the contractual triple net leases were instead structured as modified gross leases, by adding the contractual annualized triple net base rent of 2,140,936 to our estimate of annual triple net operating expenses of 848,087 for an estimated annualized base rent on a modified gross lease basis of 2,989,023 for Bel-Spring 520. 
 (2) This property contains 422,426 net rentable square feet consisting of The Landmark at One Market (378,206 net rentable square feet) as well as a separate long-term leasehold interest in approximately 44,220 net rentable square feet of space located in an adjacent six-story leasehold known as the Annex. We currently lease the Annex from an affiliate of the Paramount Group pursuant to a long-term master lease effective through June 30, 2026, which we have the option to extend until 2031 pursuant to one remaining five-year extension option.

 (a) Office portfolio leases signed but not commenced of 7,016 and 7,198 square feet are expected to commence during the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively. Retail portfolio leases signed but not commenced of 3,264, 1,200, and 27,037 square feet are expected to commence during the first, second and third quarters of 2024, respectively. 
 (b) Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying base rental payments (defined as cash base rents (before abatements)) for signed but not commenced leases as of December 31, 2023 by 12. In the case of triple net or modified gross leases, annualized base rent does not include tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area or other operating expenses. Annualized base rent per leased square foot is calculated by dividing annualized base rent, by square footage for signed by not commenced leases. 
 (c) Pro forma annualized base rent is calculated by dividing annualized base rent for commenced leases and for signed but not commenced leases as of December 31, 2023, by square footage under lease as of December 31, 2023.

(6) The Santa Fe Park RV Resort is subject to seasonal variation, with higher rates of occupancy occurring during the summer months. The number of units at the Santa Fe Park RV Resort includes 120 RV spaces and four apartments. 
 In the tables above: 
 The net rentable square feet for each of our retail properties and the retail portion of our mixed-use property is the sum of (1) the square footages of existing leases, plus (2) for available space, the field-verified square footage. The net rentable square feet for each of our office properties is the sum of (a) the square footages of existing leases, plus (b) for available space, management's estimate of net rentable square feet based, in part, on past leases. The net rentable square feet included in such office leases is generally determined consistently with the Building Owners and Managers Association, or BOMA, 2010 measurement guidelines. Net rentable square footage may be adjusted from the prior period to reflect re-measurement of leased space at the properties. 
 Percentage leased for each of our retail and office properties and the retail portion of the mixed-use property is calculated as square footage under leases as of December 31, 2023, divided by net rentable square feet, expressed as a percentage. The square footage under lease includes leases which may not have commenced as of December 31, 2023. Percentage leased for our multifamily properties is calculated as total units rented as of December 31, 2023, divided by total units available, expressed as a percentage. 
 Annualized base rent is calculated by multiplying base rental payments (defined as cash base rents, before abatements) for the month ended December 31, 2023, by 12. Annualized base rent per leased square foot is calculated by dividing annualized base rent, by square footage under lease as of December 31, 2023. In the case of triple net or modified gross leases, annualized base rent does not include tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area or other operating expenses. Total abatements for leases in effect as of December 31, 2023 for our retail and office portfolio equaled approximately 7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Total abatements for leases in effect as of December 31, 2023 for our mixed-use portfolio equaled approximately 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Total abatements for leases in effect as of December 31, 2023 for our multifamily portfolio equaled approximately 0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Units represent the total number of units available for sale or rent at December 31, 2023. 
 Average occupancy represents the percentage of available units that were sold during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023, and is calculated by dividing the number of units sold by the product of the total number of units and the total number of days in the period. Average daily rate represents the average rate paid for the units sold and is calculated by dividing the total room revenue (i.e., excluding food and beverage revenues or other hotel operations revenues such as telephone, parking and other guest services) for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023, by the number of units sold. Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, represents the total unit revenue per total available units for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023 and is calculated by multiplying average occupancy by the average daily rate. RevPAR does not include food and beverage revenues or other hotel operations revenues such as telephone, parking and other guest services. 
 Average monthly base rent per leased unit represents the average monthly base rent per leased units as of December 31, 2023.

Geographic Diversification 
 Our properties are located in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii. The following table shows the number of properties, the net rentable square feet and the percentage of total portfolio net rentable square footage in each region as of December 31, 2023. Our six multifamily properties are excluded from the table below and are located in Southern California and Portland, Oregon. The hotel portion of our mixed-use property is also excluded and is located in Hawaii.

 Segment Diversification 
 The following table sets forth information regarding the total property operating income for each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands).

 Lease Expirations 
 The following table sets forth a summary schedule of the lease expirations for leases in place as of December 31, 2023, plus available space, for each of the ten calendar years beginning January 1, 2024 at the properties in our retail portfolio, office portfolio and the retail portion of our mixed-use portfolio. The square footage of available space excludes the space from 6 leases that terminated on December 31, 2023. In 2024, we expect a similar level of leasing activity for new and expiring leases compared to prior years with overall positive increases in rental income. However, changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative, and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels, if at all. 
 
 38 

The lease expirations for our multifamily portfolio and the hotel portion of our mixed-use portfolio are excluded from this table because multifamily unit leases generally have lease terms ranging from seven to fifteen months, with a majority having twelve-month lease terms, and because rooms in the hotel are rented on a nightly basis. The information set forth in the table assumes that tenants do not exercise any renewal options.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, we, us, our, and our company mean American Assets Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including American Assets Trust, L.P. In statements regarding qualification as a REIT, such terms refer solely to American Assets Trust, Inc. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors or elsewhere in this document. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 Our Company 
 We are a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops high quality office, retail, multifamily and mixed-use properties in attractive, high-barrier-to-entry markets in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon, Texas, and Hawaii. As of December 31, 2023, our portfolio was comprised of twelve office properties; twelve retail shopping centers; a mixed-use property consisting of a 369-room all-suite hotel and a retail shopping center; and six multifamily properties. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we owned land at three of our properties that we classified as held for development or construction in progress. Our core markets include San Diego, California; the San Francisco Bay Area, California; Bellevue, Washington; Portland, Oregon, and Oahu, Hawaii. American Assets Trust, Inc., as the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, has control of our Operating Partnership and owned 78.8 of our Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of our Operating Partnership. 
 
 Taxable REIT Subsidiary 
 On November 5, 2010, we formed American Assets Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is wholly owned by our Operating Partnership and which we refer to as our services company. We have elected, together with our services company, to treat our services company as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary generally may provide non-customary and other services to our tenants and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT, provided a taxable REIT subsidiary may not operate or manage a lodging facility or provide rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility is operated. We may form additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future, and our Operating Partnership may contribute some or all of its interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries or their assets to our services company. Any income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries will not be included in our taxable income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests, except to the extent such income is distributed to us as a dividend, in which case such dividend income will qualify under the 95 , but not the 75 , gross income test. Because a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax and state and local income tax (where applicable) as a regular corporation, the income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries generally will be subject to an additional level of tax as compared to the income earned by our other subsidiaries. 

Outlook 
 
 We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following: growth in our same-store portfolio, growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions. Our properties are located in some of the nation's most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii, which we believe allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation, expansion, reconfiguration, and/or retenanting. We evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities. 
 
 We intend to opportunistically pursue projects in our development pipeline including future phases of La Jolla Commons and Lloyd Portfolio, as well as other redevelopments at Waikele Center. The commencement of these developments is based on, among other things, market conditions and our evaluation of whether such opportunities would generate appropriate risk adjusted financial returns. Our redevelopment and development opportunities are subject to various factors, including market conditions and may not ultimately come to fruition. We continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that would complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. Some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities. Any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. Changes in interest rates may affect our success in 
 
 43 

achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance a property acquisition. Generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash, mortgage loans and/or borrowings under our credit facility, which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. 

Same-store 
 
 We have provided certain information on a total portfolio, same-store and redevelopment same-store basis. Information provided on a same-store basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared, properties under development, properties classified as held for development and properties classified as discontinued operations. Information provided on a redevelopment same-store basis includes the results of properties undergoing significant redevelopment for the entirety or portion of both periods being compared. Same-store and redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in eliminating disparities due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's stabilized and redevelopment properties, as applicable. Additionally, redevelopment same-store is considered by management to be an important measure because it assists in evaluating the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment opportunities and the impact that these redevelopments have in enhancing our operating performance. 
 While there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically reclassify significant development, redevelopment or expansion properties to same-store properties once they are stabilized. Properties are deemed stabilized typically at the earlier of (1) reaching 90 occupancy or (2) four quarters following a property's inclusion in operating real estate. We typically remove properties from same-store properties when the development, redevelopment or expansion has or is expected to have a significant impact on the property's annualized base rent, occupancy and operating income within the calendar year. Acquired properties are classified to same-store properties once we have owned such properties for the entirety of comparable period(s) and the properties are not under significant development or expansion. 
 
 Below is a summary of our same-store composition for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2022, Eastgate Office Park and Corporate Campus East III were reclassified to same-store properties because these properties were acquired on July 7, 2021 and September 10, 2021, respectively. Because Bel-Spring 520 was acquired on March 8, 2022, it is classified as non-same-store property for the year ended December 31, 2023. One Beach Street continues to be identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant construction activity. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the designations for the year ended December 31, 2021, Waikiki Beach Walk-Retail and Embassy Suites Hotel was reclassified to same-store due to significant spalling repair activity impacting the hotel portion of the property's operations, which was completed on September 30, 2020. Eastgate Office Park was classified as non-same-store, as it was acquired on July 7, 2021. Corporate Campus East III was classified as non-same-store, as it was acquired on September 10, 2021. Bel-Spring 520 was classified as non-same-store, as it was acquired on March 8, 2022. One Beach Street continues to be identified as a same-store redevelopment property due to significant construction activity.

Revenue Base 
 Rental income consists of scheduled rent charges, straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above market and below market rents acquired. We also derive revenue from tenant recoveries and other property revenues, including parking income, lease termination fees, late fees, storage rents and other miscellaneous property revenues. 
 Office Leases . Our office portfolio included twelve properties with a total of approximately 4.1 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, these properties were 86.0 leased. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the office segment contributed 47.1 of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased office properties to tenants primarily on a full service gross or a modified gross basis and to a limited extent on a triple-net lease basis. We expect to continue to do so in the future. A full-service gross or modified gross lease has a base year expense stop, whereby the tenant pays a stated amount of certain expenses as part of the rent payment, while future increases in property operating expenses (above the base year stop) are billed to the tenant based on such tenant's proportionate square footage of the property. The increased property operating expenses billed are reflected as operating expenses and amounts recovered from tenants are reflected as rental income in the statements of operations. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we signed 49 office leases for 322,418 square feet with an average rent of 66.42 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term. Of the leases, 34 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an increase of 2.4 in cash basis rent and an increase of 10.8 in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases. 
 Retail Leases . Our retail portfolio included twelve properties with a total of approximately 3.1 million rentable square feet available for lease as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, these properties were 94.3 leased. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the retail segment contributed 23.7 , of our total revenue. Historically, we have leased retail properties to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. In a triple-net lease, the tenant is responsible for all property taxes and operating expenses. As such, the base rent payment does not include any operating expense, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. The full amount of the expenses for this lease type, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, is reflected in operating expenses, and the reimbursement is reflected as rental income in the statements of operations. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we signed 86 retail leases for 405,144 square feet with an average rent of 34.18 per square foot during the initial year of the lease term, including leases signed for the retail portion of our mixed-use property. Of the leases, 75 represent comparable leases where there was a prior tenant, with an increase of 6.5 in cash basis rent and an increase of 15.4 in straight-line rent compared to the prior leases. 
 Multifamily Leases . Our multifamily portfolio included six apartment properties, as well as an RV resort, with a total of 2,110 units (including 120 RV spaces) available for lease as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, these properties were 92.3 leased. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the multifamily segment contributed 14.0 of our total revenue. Our multifamily leases, other than at our RV resort, generally have lease terms ranging from 7 to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms. Tenants normally pay a base rental amount, usually quoted in terms of a monthly rate for the respective unit. Spaces at the RV resort can be rented at a daily, weekly, or monthly rate. The average monthly base rent per leased unit as of December 31, 2023 was 2,619, compared to 2,483 at December 31, 2022. 
 Mixed-Use Property Revenue . Our mixed-use property consists of approximately 94,000 rentable square feet of retail space and a 369-room all-suite hotel. Revenue from the mixed-use property consists of revenue earned from retail leases, and revenue earned from the hotel, which consists of room revenue, food and beverage services, parking and other guest services. As of December 31, 2023, the retail portion of the property was 95.1 leased, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the hotel had an average occupancy of 85.2 . For the year ended December 31, 2023, the mixed-use segment contributed 15.1 , of our total revenue. We have leased the retail portion of such property to tenants primarily on a triple-net lease basis, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. As such, the base rent payment under such leases does not include any operating expenses, but rather all such expenses, to the extent they are paid by the landlord, are billed to the tenant. Rooms at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property are rented on a nightly basis. 
 
 Leasing 
 
 Our same-store growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy. Over the long-term, we believe that the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide us with a strategic advantage, allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates. Furthermore, we believe the locations of our properties and diversified portfolio will mitigate some of the potentially negative impact of the current economic environment.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we signed 49 office leases for a total of 322,418 square feet of office space including 261,246 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of 2.4 on a cash basis and an average rental increase of 10.8 on a straight-line basis. New office leases for comparable spaces were signed for 42,739 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 19.9 on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of 21.8 on a straight-line basis. Renewals for comparable office spaces were signed for 218,507 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 0.1 on a cash basis and increase of 9.3 on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were 74.83 per square foot of office space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. There were 46.55 per square foot of office space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we signed 86 retail leases for a total of 405,144 square feet of retail space including 367,810 square feet of comparable space leases, at an average rental rate increase of 6.5 on a cash basis and an average rental increase of 15.4 on a straight-line basis. New retail leases for comparable spaces were signed for 2,634 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 75.5 on a cash basis and an average rental rate increase of 145.7 on a straight-line basis (due to the modification of prior tenants' rent to cash-basis, which precluded straight-line rent for comparison). Renewals for comparable retail spaces were signed for 365,176 square feet at an average rental rate increase of 5.7 on a cash basis and an increase of 14.7 on a straight-line basis. Tenant improvements and incentives were 30.37 per square foot of retail space for comparable new leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. There were 7.25 per square foot of retail space of tenant improvement or incentives for comparable renewal leases for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in arms-length transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period. The comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and, in some instances, projections of first lease year percentage rent, to be paid on the new lease. In some instances, management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation. The change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates, location, individual tenant creditworthiness, use of space, market conditions when the expiring lease was signed, capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure. Tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement of a space as it relates to a specific lease, but may also include base building costs (i.e., expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements. 
 
 The leases signed in 2023 will typically become effective in 2024, though some may not become effective until 2025. Further, there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating, financing or other matters. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. In addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third-party experts. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in the section above entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report; however, the most critical accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows: 

46 

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable 
 Our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases. Substantially all such leases contain fixed rent escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease. Base rents are recognized on a straight-line basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease, net of valuation adjustments, based on management's assessment of credit, collection and other business risks. When we determine that we are the owner of tenant improvements and the tenant has reimbursed us for a portion or all of the tenant improvement costs, we consider the amount paid to be additional rent, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. For first generation tenants, in instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us, revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant. When we determine that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, tenant allowances are recorded as lease incentives and we commence revenue recognition and lease incentive amortization when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin. Percentage rents, which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants, are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible. Real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred. 
 Other property income includes parking income, general excise tax billed to tenants, fees charged to tenants at our multifamily properties and food and beverage sales at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Other property income is recognized when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our services to customers. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the later of the termination date or the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the lease termination, including, without limitation, payment of all lease termination fees. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement. 
 Current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. Accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement. 
 We recognize revenue on the hotel portion of our mixed-use property from the rental of hotel rooms and guest services when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control when the rooms are occupied and services have been provided. Food and beverage sales are recognized when the customer has been served or at the time the transaction occurs. Revenue from room rental is included in rental revenue on the statement of comprehensive income. Revenue from other sales and services provided is included in other property income on the statement of comprehensive income. 
 We make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. The collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic trends, including the continued impact of COVID-19 on tenant's businesses and changes in tenants' payment patterns, tenant bankruptcies, the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants, the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If our assessment of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to collect substantially all rents, we recognize a charge to rental income and limit our rental income to the lesser of lease income on a straight-line basis plus variable rents when they become accruable or cash collected. If we change our conclusion regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lessee, we may recognize an adjustment to rental income in the period we make a change to our prior conclusion. 
 
 Due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straight-line rents, the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year. Our experience relative to unbilled straight-line rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations, lease modifications, bankruptcies and other factors. Accordingly, the extended collection period for straight-line rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straight-line rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured. Any changes to our conclusion regarding these assessments of collectability would have a direct impact on our net income. 

47 

Since the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, we have provided lease concessions to certain tenants, primarily within the retail segment, in the form of rent deferrals and abatements in recognition of the adverse impact that COVID-19 had on such tenants, although the concessions provided during the year ended December 31, 2023 were immaterial to us. These lease concessions generally included an increase in our rights as a lessor. We assess each lease concession and determine whether it represents a lease modifications under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases ("ASC 842"). 
 Real Estate 
 Depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives range generally from 30 years to a maximum of 40 years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 15 years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are replaced or have no future value. Our estimates of useful lives have a direct impact on our net income. If expected useful lives of our real estate assets were shortened, we would depreciate the assets over a shorter time period, resulting in an increase to depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease to net income on an annual basis. 
 Acquisitions of properties are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance on acquisitions and business combinations. Our methodology of allocating the cost of acquisitions to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on estimated fair values, replacement cost and appraised values. When we acquire operating real estate properties, the purchase price is allocated to land and buildings, intangibles such as in-place leases, and to current assets and liabilities acquired, if any. Such valuations include a consideration of the noncancelable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal period(s). The fair values associated with below market renewal options are determined based on a review of several qualitative and quantitative factors on a lease-by-lease basis at acquisition to determine whether it is probable that the tenant would exercise its option to renew the lease agreement. These factors include: (1) the type of tenant in relation to the property it occupies, (2) the quality of the tenant, including the tenant's long term business prospects, and (3) whether the fixed rate renewal option was sufficiently lower than the fair rental of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable such that it would appear to be reasonably assured that the tenant would exercise the option to renew. Each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment, and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land, there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount. If we were to allocate more value to the buildings, as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases, this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time, since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the leases. 
 The value allocated to in-place leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The value of above and below market leases associated with the original noncancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective noncancelable lease periods and are reflected as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. If a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease or the lease is not renewed, the unamortized balance of any in-place lease value is written off to rental income and amortization expense. The value of the leases associated with below market lease renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods. We make assumptions and estimates related to below market lease renewal options, which impact revenue in the period in which the renewal options are exercised and could result in significant increases to revenue if the renewal options are not exercised at which time the related below market lease liabilities would be written off as an increase to revenue. 
 Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business, such as broker fees, transfer taxes, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred and included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For asset acquisitions not meeting the definition of a business, transaction costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost.

Capitalized Costs 
 
 Certain external and internal costs directly related to the development and redevelopment of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, interest, construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. We capitalize costs under development until construction is substantially complete and the property is held available for occupancy. The determination of when a development project is substantially complete and when capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. We consider a construction project as substantially complete and held available for occupancy upon the completion of landlord-owned tenant improvements or when the lessee takes possession of the unimproved space for construction of its own improvements, but not later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with any remaining portion under construction. 
 
 We capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of 24.0 million and 73.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 We capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements combined of 54.2 million and 43.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 
 Interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service. Capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion, which is when the asset is ready for its intended use as noted above. We make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income. If the time period for capitalizing interest is extended, more interest is capitalized, thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period. We capitalized interest costs related to both development and redevelopment activities combined of 7.8 million and 5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The decrease in tenant improvements and leasing commissions for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to tenant buildouts at The Landmark at One Market, City Center Bellevue and Alamo Quarry Market completed in the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by new tenant buildouts at Torrey Point, Carmel Mountain Plaza and Del Monte Center during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The increase in maintenance capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to renovations at Eastgate Office Park, City Center Bellevue and La Jolla Commons. 
 The decrease in new development expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 21, 2022 was primarily related to costs incurred for the development of Tower 3 at La Jolla Commons. The decrease in redevelopment expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily related to the modernization costs of One Beach Street. 
 Our capital expenditures during the year ending December 31, 2024 will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of our held for development and construction in progress properties. While the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors, we expect expenditures incurred in the year ending December 31, 2024 to decrease from the year ending December 31, 2023 as we expect to reach completion of development activities at La Jolla Commons during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 We may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. We may enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. 
 Any interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of equity. Our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not match, such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation periods and the use of SOFR. In addition, we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. However, management does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. If a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We review for impairment on a property by property basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written-down to fair value. The calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. Since our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. Actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. These estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. 
 Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. Although our strategy is to hold our properties over the long-term, if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to fair value and such loss could be material. 
 No impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.

Income Taxes 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our net taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gains, and meet the various other requirements imposed by the Code relating to such matters as operating results, asset holdings, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Provided we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are generally not subject to corporate level income tax on the earnings distributed currently to our stockholders. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the Code, our taxable income generally would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax. Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders or American Assets Trust, L.P.'s unitholders. 
 We, together with one of our subsidiaries, have elected to treat such subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes.

 Total office rental revenue increased 4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase of 3.2 million in same-store office rental revenue due to higher annualized base rents at Torrey Reserve Campus, Solana Crossing and The Landmark at One Market. Additionally, rental revenue increased 0.8 million due to the acquisition of Bel-Spring 520. These increases were offset by lower occupancy at Eastgate Office Park and a decrease related to accelerated revenue recognition in 2022 of tenant improvement overages due to a tenant vacating its space earlier than the original lease expiration date. 
 Total retail rental revenue increased 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to new tenant leases signed, scheduled rent increases and tenants previously on alternate rent reverting back to basic monthly rent. These increases are primarily related to Carmel Mountain Plaza, Lomas Santa Fe Plaza, Alamo Quarry Market, Waikele Center and Del Monte Center. Additionally, there was an increase in cost recoveries of 0.7 million. 
 Multifamily rental revenue increased 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an overall increase in average monthly base rent of 2,581 for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2,349 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Average occupancy decreased to 90.0 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 92.9 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Mixed-use rental revenue increased 5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase of 4.7 million at the Waikiki Beach Walk hotel portion of our mixed-use property. This was due to an increase in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 85.2 and 318 for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to 76.9 and 283 for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Additionally, there was an increase of 0.4 million at the Waikiki Beach Walk retail portion of our mixed-use property due to new tenant leases signed and tenants previously on alternate rent reverting back to basic monthly rent.

 Retail other property income increased 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to lease termination fees received at Carmel Mountain Plaza and Southbay Marketplace. 
 Multifamily other property income decreased 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in meter income and late fees at Pacific Ridge Apartments, Loma Palisades and Hassalo on Eighth - Multifamily. 
 Mixed-use other property income increased 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increased tourism and hotel occupancy which led to an increase in other room rental income and excise taxes at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and an increase in parking garage income at the retail portion of our mixed-use property. 
 Property Expenses 
 Total Property Expenses. Total property expenses consist of rental expenses and real estate taxes. Total property expenses increased by 11.5 million, or 8 , to 164.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 152.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Retail real estate taxes decreased 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a one-time real estate tax refund received during 2023 at Carmel Mountain Plaza and Del Monte Center.

 55 

Total office property operating income increased 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to higher annualized base rents at Torrey Reserve Campus, Solana Crossing and The Landmark at One Market. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to utilities expenses, repairs and facilities services and insurance expenses. Additionally, there was a decrease due to lower occupancy at Eastgate Office Park and a decrease related to accelerated revenue recognition in 2022 of tenant improvement overages due to a tenant vacating its space earlier than the original lease expiration date. 
 Retail property operating income increased 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to new tenant leases signed, scheduled rent increases and tenants previously on alternate rent reverting back to basic monthly rent. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to facilities services and insurance expenses. 
 Multifamily property operating income increased 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to an overall decrease in average occupancy and increase in average monthly base rent of 90.0 and 2,581, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 92.9 and 2,349, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were partially offset by higher utilities expenses, insurance expenses and repairs and maintenance expenses. 
 Mixed-use property operating income increased 1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the Waikiki Beach Walk hotel portion of our mixed use property, which had an increase in average occupancy and revenue per available room to 85.2 and 318, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 76.9 and 283, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was partially offset by higher rental expenses related to room expenses, personnel costs, facilities expenses and excise taxes. 
 Other 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 3.8 million, or 12 , to 36.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to increases in stock-based compensation expense, general legal expenses and employee-related costs, including, without limitation, with respect to base pay for certain salaried and hourly workers and benefits. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 3.8 million, or 3 , to 119.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 123.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This was due to tenants vacating space during the year ended December 31, 2022 at City Center Bellevue, Eastgate Office Park, Corporate Campus East III and Hassalo on Eighth - Retail. This decrease was partially offset by new building and tenant improvements placed into service in 2023 at Torrey Reserve Campus, Bel-Spring 520, Lloyd Portfolio and First Main. 
 Interest expense. Interest expense, net increased 6.5 million, or 11 , to 64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher interest on our 225 million Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement and related amortization of loan fees. This was partially offset by lower interest expense on the new non-recourse mortgage on City Center Bellevue and an increase in capitalized interest related to our development projects. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income, net increased 8.3 million, or 1,324 , to other income, net of 7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to other expense, net of 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the net settlement payment of approximately 6.3 million received on January 3, 2023 related to certain building systems at our Hassalo on Eighth property and an increase of 2.0 million in interest and investment income attributed to the higher yield on our average cash balance during the period. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. section, the term the company refers only to American Assets Trust, Inc. on an unconsolidated basis, and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries. 
 
 The company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership, of which the company is the parent company and sole general partner, and which it consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Because the company operates on a consolidated basis with the Operating Partnership, the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole. 

56 

The company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself, other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the Operating Partnership. The company itself does not have any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the consolidated assets and liabilities and the consolidated revenues and expenses of the company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly by the Operating Partnership. The company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock. The company s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the Operating Partnership. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the company owned an approximate 78.8 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 21.2 are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of the company's directors and executive officers. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, American Assets Trust, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete authority and control over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and business, can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and can cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. The company causes the Operating Partnership to distribute such portion of its available cash as the company may in its discretion determine, in the manner provided in the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement. 
 
 The liquidity of the company is dependent on the Operating Partnership s ability to make sufficient distributions to the company. The primary cash requirement of the company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The company also guarantees some of the Operating Partnership s debt, as discussed further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. If the Operating Partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements, which trigger the company s guarantee obligations, then the company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. However, the company s only significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 We believe the Operating Partnership s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured line of credit, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and, in turn, for the company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. As of December 31, 2023, the company has determined that it has adequate working capital to meet its dividend funding obligations for the next 12 months. However, we cannot assure you that the Operating Partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership s ability to pay its distributions to the company, which would in turn, adversely affect the company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 
 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for future dividends expected to be paid to the company s stockholders, operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, general and administrative expenses, funding construction projects, capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. 
 
 The company may from time to time seek to repurchase or redeem the Operating Partnership s outstanding debt, the company s shares of common stock or other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 For the company to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. While historically the company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the company s own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not REITs can. The company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership s working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. 
 
 The company is a well-known seasoned issuer. As circumstances warrant, the company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. When the company receives proceeds from preferred or common equity issuances, it is required by the Operating Partnership s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the Operating Partnership in exchange for preferred or common partnership units of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, to develop new or existing properties, to acquire properties or for general corporate purposes. 
 
 57 

In December 2023, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC, which became effective upon filing and which replaced the prior Form S-3ASR that was filed with the SEC in January 2021. The universal shelf registration statement may permit the company from time to time to offer and sell equity securities of the company. However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any such offerings of securities. Factors influencing the availability of additional financing include investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets, among others. 
 On December 3, 2021, the company entered into a new at-the-market, or ATM, equity program with five sales agents under which the company may, from time to time, offer and sell shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 250.0 million, or the 2021 ATM Program. The sales of shares of the company's common stock made through the 2021 ATM Program are to be made in at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2023, the company had not issued any shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program. 
 The company intends to use the net proceeds from any issuances of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program to fund development or redevelopment activities, repay amounts outstanding from time to time under our third amended and restated credit facility or other debt financing obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities and/or for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, the company had the capacity to issue up to an additional 250.0 million in shares of common stock under the 2021 ATM Program. Actual future sales will depend on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the company's capital needs. The company has no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under the 2021 ATM Program. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. 
 
 In this Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, L.P. section, the terms we, our and us refer to the Operating Partnership together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Operating Partnership and American Assets Trust, Inc. together with their consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. American Assets Trust, Inc. is our sole general partner and consolidates our results of operations for financial reporting purposes. Because we operate on a consolidated basis with American Assets Trust, Inc., the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources of American Assets Trust, Inc. should be read in conjunction with this section to understand our liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis. 
 Due to the nature of our business, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations. The cash generated from operations is used for the payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders and our unitholders. As a REIT, American Assets Trust, Inc. must generally make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 of its net taxable income. 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, regular debt service requirements, dividend payments to American Assets Trust, Inc.'s stockholders required to maintain its REIT status, distributions to our other unitholders, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, borrowings available under our third amended and restated credit facility. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions, tenant improvements and capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements to pay scheduled debt maturities and to fund property acquisitions and capital improvements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and, if necessary, the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and capital improvements using our third amended and restated credit facility pending permanent financing. We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt, noting that during the third quarter of 2015, the company obtained investment grade credit ratings from Moody s Investors Service (Baa3), Standard Poor s Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (BBB), and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about our company. Given our past ability to access the capital markets, we expect debt or equity to be available to us. Although there is no intent at this time, if market conditions deteriorate, we may also delay the timing of future development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy. 
 Our overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities, the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of developments. Our capital investments will be funded on a short-term basis with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and/or our third amended and restated credit facility. 
 
 58 

We intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment grade debt ratings. In the short and long term, we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity, unsecured and/or secured debt financings, and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure. 
 
 We currently believe that cash flows from operations, cash on hand, our 2021 ATM Program, our third amended and restated credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures.

The decrease in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of Bel-Spring 520 on March 8, 2022, and decrease in capital expenditures at La Jolla Commons III and One Beach Street. 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased 37.2 million to 65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the term loan agreement that was amended and restated, among other things, to increase the fully drawn borrowings from 150 million to 225 million. This was partially offset by the repayment of the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit and payment of quarterly dividends.

Net Operating Income 
 Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. We define NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expenses, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance). NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related expense, other non-property income and losses, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. 
 NOI is used by investors and our management to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties and to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of our properties as it is not affected by (1) the cost of funds of the property owner, (2) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP, or (3) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The cost of funds is eliminated from net income because it is specific to the particular financing capabilities and constraints of the owner. The cost of funds is also eliminated because it is dependent on historical interest rates and other costs of capital as well as past decisions made by us regarding the appropriate mix of capital which may have changed or may change in the future. Depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets are eliminated because they may not accurately represent the actual change in value in our office, retail, multifamily or mixed-use properties that result from use of the properties or changes in market conditions. While certain aspects of real property do decline in value over time in a manner that is intended to be captured by depreciation and amortization, the value of the properties as a whole have historically increased or decreased as a result of changes in overall economic conditions instead of from actual use of the property or the passage of time. Gains and losses from the sale of real property vary from property to property and are affected by market conditions at the time of sale which will usually change from period to period. These gains and losses can create distortions when comparing one period to another or when comparing our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies that have not made similarly timed purchases or sales. We believe that eliminating these costs from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating our properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, interest income and other expense, depreciation and amortization expense and gains or losses from the sale of properties, and other gains and losses as stipulated by GAAP, the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which are significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of net income which further limits its usefulness. 
 NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties but does not measure our performance as a whole. NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income as computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure should be analyzed in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with GAAP and discussions elsewhere in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations regarding the components of net income that are eliminated in the calculation of NOI. Other companies may use different methods for calculating NOI or similarly entitled measures and, accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies that do not define the measure exactly as we do. 
 The following is a reconciliation of our NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 computed in accordance with GAAP (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net operating income 277,207 270,215 246,054 General and administrative (35,960) (32,143) (29,879) Depreciation and amortization (119,500) (123,338) (116,306) Interest expense, net (64,706) (58,232) (58,587) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (4,271) Other income (expense), net 7,649 (625) (418) Net income 64,690 55,877 36,593

Funds from Operations 
 We present FFO because we consider FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our FFO for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 to net income, the nearest GAAP equivalent (in thousands, except per share and share data): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021 Net income 64,690 55,877 36,593 Plus: Real estate depreciation and amortization 119,500 123,338 116,306 Funds from operations, as defined by NAREIT 184,190 179,215 152,899 Less: Nonforfeitable dividends on restricted stock awards (749) (641) (557) FFO attributable to common stock and units 183,441 178,574 152,342 FFO per diluted share/unit 2.40 2.34 2.00 Weighted average number of common shares and units, diluted (1) 
 76,346,772 76,233,814 76,175,004 
 
 (1) For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the weighted average common shares used to compute FFO per diluted share include unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to time vesting, as the vesting of the restricted stock awards is dilutive in the computation of FFO per diluted shares, but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted EPS for the periods. Diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable. 
 
 Inflation 
 Substantially all of our office and retail leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above. In addition, our multifamily leases (other than at our RV resort where spaces can be rented at a daily, weekly or monthly rate) generally have lease terms ranging from seven to 15 months, with a majority having 12-month lease terms, and generally allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal, which we believe reduces our exposure to the effects of inflation. For the hotel portion of our mixed-use property, we possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. However, competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. 
 
 61 

We may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk. We use interest rate swap agreements, for example, to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixed-rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions. We use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. See the discussion under Note 8, Derivative and Hedging Activities, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for certain quantitative details related to the interest rate swaps. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Outstanding Debt 
 The following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on the fair value of our total outstanding debt. Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. Discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. This analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt, such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change. This analysis assumes no change in our financial structure. 
 Fixed Interest Rate Debt 
 Except as described below, all of our outstanding debt obligations (maturing at various times through February 2031) have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates. However, interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments. At December 31, 2023, we had 1.4 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding with an estimated fair value of 1.3 billion. If interest rates at December 31, 2023 had been 1.0 higher, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 36.2 million. If interest rates at December 31, 2023 had been 1.0 lower, the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 58.5 million. Additionally, we consider our 325 million debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023, related to Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan C, to be fixed rate debt as the rate is effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements. 
 Variable Interest Rate Debt 
 At December 31, 2023, we had 325.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding, all of which is subject to interest rate swaps as described above. We have historically entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in order to economically hedge against the risk of rising interest rates that would affect our interest expense related to our future anticipated debt issuances as part of our overall borrowing program. See the discussion under Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details related to the interest rate swaps and for a discussion on how we value derivative financial instruments. Based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms, if market interest rates increased or decreased by 1.0 , our annual interest expense would not change, nor would there be a change in our net income and cash flows for the year, since this variable rate debt is effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Controls and Procedures (American Assets Trust, Inc.) 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 American Assets Trust, Inc. maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure 
 
 62 

controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, American Assets Trust, Inc. carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, American Assets Trust, Inc. s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, American Assets Trust, Inc. s disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, American Assets Trust, Inc. s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by American Assets Trust, Inc. s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including American Assets Trust, Inc. s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, American Assets Trust, Inc. conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. 
 American Assets Trust, Inc. s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report over American Assets Trust, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting, which report is contained elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in American Assets Trust, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, American Assets Trust, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Controls and Procedures (American Assets Trust, L.P.) 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Assets Trust, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Assets Trust, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 16(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 14, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

F-2 

Impairment of real estate properties Description of the Matter The Company s net real estate properties totaled 2.71 billion as of December 31, 2023. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount, at which time the property is written down to its estimated fair value. Properties classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. There were no impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Auditing the Company's impairment assessment for real estate properties is challenging because of the subjective auditor judgment necessary in evaluating management s identification of indicators of potential impairment and the related assessment of the severity of such indicators in determining whether a triggering event has occurred that requires the Company to evaluate the recoverability of the asset. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s property impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management s process for identifying and evaluating potential impairment indicators. 
 
 Our testing of the Company s impairment assessment included, among other procedures, evaluating significant judgments applied in determining whether indicators of impairment were present at any given property by obtaining evidence to corroborate such judgments and searching for evidence contrary to such judgments. For example, we searched for tenants or groups of tenants with large reserved balances or upcoming lease expirations that occupy a substantial portion of any particular property and searched for significant declines in operating results of any particular property due to occupancy changes, tenant bankruptcies, environmental issues, adverse changes in legal factors or natural disasters.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Assets Trust, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited American Assets Trust, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, American Assets Trust, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 16(a) and our report dated February 14, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term, we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement. Lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the later of the termination date or the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the lease termination, including, without limitation, payment of all lease termination fees. When a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement, the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement. 
 
 Current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements. Accounts receivable from straight-line rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straight-line rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement. 
 We recognize revenue on the hotel portion of our mixed-use property from the rental of hotel rooms and guest services when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control when the rooms are occupied and services have been provided. Food and beverage sales are recognized when the customer has been served or at the time the transaction occurs. Revenue from room rental is included in rental revenue on the statement of comprehensive income. Revenue from other sales and services provided is included in other property income on the statement of comprehensive income. 
 We make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straight-line rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management. The collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic trends, including the impact of the COVID-19 on tenant's businesses and changes in tenants' payment patterns, tenant bankruptcies, the status of collectability of current cash rents receivable, tenants' recent and historical financial and operating results, changes in our tenants' credit ratings, communications between our operating personnel and tenants, the extent of security deposits and letters of credits held with respect to tenants, and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If our assessment of these factors indicates that it is no longer probable that we will be able to collect substantially all rents, we recognize a charge to rental income and limit our rental income to the lesser of lease income on a straight-line basis plus variable rents when they become accruable or cash collected. If we change our conclusion regarding the probability of collecting rent payments required by a lessee, we may recognize an adjustment to rental income in the period we make a change to our prior conclusion. 
 At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million, respectively. Total collectability related adjustments for rental income, which includes the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred rent receivables, was million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

years to a maximum of years on buildings and major improvements. Minor improvements, furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from years to years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the related assets are charged to operations as incurred. Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related lease or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of its lease, the undepreciated balance of any tenant improvements are written off if they are replaced or have no future value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, real estate depreciation expense was million, million and million, respectively.

 These forward-starting interest rate swap contracts are designed to fix the effective interest rates (1) associated with Term Loan A at through its maturity date, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated leverage ratio, (2) associated with Term Loan B at from January 5, 2023 to January 4, 2024 and at from January 5, 2024 to January 4, 2025, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated debt ratio and (3) associated with Term Loan C at from January 5, 2023 to January 4, 2024 and at from January 5, 2024 to January 4, 2025, subject to adjustments based on our consolidated debt ratio.

 We also previously entered into forward-starting interest rate swap contracts in connection with our Series D Notes (the Series D Interest Rate Swaps ), which we subsequently settled. The Series D Interest Rate Swaps fixed the effective interest rate of the Series D Notes at per annum. All of the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that we have entered into have been deemed to be highly effective cash flow hedges and have been designated as accounting hedges. 
 
 In addition, we have entered into treasury lock contracts from time to time in connection with the Operating Partnership s Notes to reduce their interest rate variability exposure. As a result of these treasury lock contracts (1) the effective interest rate of our Series E Notes is per annum, (2) the effective interest rate of our Series F Notes is per annum, and (3) the effective interest rate of our Series G Notes is per annum. These treasury lock contracts have been deemed to be highly effective cash flow hedges and have been designated as accounting hedges. Any gains or losses incurred upon the settlement of these treasury lock contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and are amortized to interest expense over the life of the related series of Notes. 
 
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are being recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified into earnings during the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. For the next twelve months, we estimate that million will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

 Taxability of Dividends 
 Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders and holders of common units, may differ from income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal income tax purposes in the treatment of loss on extinguishment of debt, revenue recognition and compensation expense and in the basis of depreciable assets and estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation.

 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The company has established the 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan, which provides for grants to directors, employees and consultants of the company and the Operating Partnership of stock options, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, stock payments, performance shares, LTIP units, stock appreciation rights and other incentive awards. In June 2020, at the annual shareholder meeting, the shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "Amended and Restated 2011 Plan"). An aggregate of shares of our common stock are authorized for issuance under awards granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2011 Plan, and as of December 31, 2023, shares of common stock remain available for future issuance.

 (1) Restricted common stock issued to members of the company's non-employee directors. These awards of restricted stock will vest subject to the director's continued service on the Board of Directors on the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the date of grant or (ii) the date of the next annual meeting of our stockholders, if such non-employee director continues his or her service on the Board of Directors until the next annual meeting of stockholders, but not thereafter, pursuant to our independent director compensation policy. 
 (2) Restricted common stock issued to certain of the company's senior management and other employees, which are subject to quantitative and qualitative performance criteria based vesting. Up to one-third of the shares of restricted stock may vest based on such performance criteria determined as of November 30, 2022, 2023 and 2024, subject to the employee's continued employment on those dates. 
 (3) Restricted common stock issued to certain of the company's senior management and other employees, which are subject to quantitative and qualitative performance criteria based vesting. Up to one-third of the shares of restricted stock may vest based on such performance criteria determined as of November 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, subject to the employee's continued employment on those dates. 
 
 For the 2020 grants, the fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. Our stock price, along with the stock prices of the group of peer REITs, is assumed to follow the Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion Process. Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion is a common assumption when modeling in financial markets, as it allows the modeled quantity (in this case, the stock price) to vary randomly from its current value and take any value greater than zero. The volatilities of the returns on the stock price of the company and the group REITs were estimated based on a look-back period. The expected growth rate of the stock prices over the derived service period of the employee is determined with consideration of the risk free rate as of the grant date. 
 For the 2021 grants, 2022 grants, and 2023 grants, the fair value of the awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. For the 2021, 2022, and 2023 grants, vesting is subject to multiple vesting conditions as follows: (1) a service condition which requires continued employment of the employee as of each vesting date during the vesting term for the employee to be eligible for vesting, (2) a performance condition with respect to our FFO per share for the FFO performance periods and (3) a market condition with respect to our relative total shareholder return performance over a , and performance as compared to a pre-determined index. On each measurement date the performance condition and market condition performance will determine the number of shares that vest. We measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the grant date, adjusted for changes to probabilities of achieving performance targets, and recognize expense over the vesting period. For the restricted stock grants that are time-vesting, issued to our non-employee directors, we estimate the stock compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date.

 We recognize noncash compensation expense ratably over the vesting period, and accordingly, we recognized million, million and million in noncash compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, each of which is included in general and administrative expense on the statement of comprehensive income. Unrecognized compensation expense was million at December 31, 2023, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of years . 
 Earnings Per Share 
 We have calculated earnings per share EPS under the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby EPS for each class of common stock and participating security is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we had a weighted average of approximately shares, shares and unvested shares outstanding, respectively, which are considered participating securities. Therefore, we have allocated our earnings for basic and diluted EPS between common shares and unvested shares. 
 Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive instruments outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. For the year ended December 31, 2023, diluted shares exclude incentive restricted stock as these awards are considered contingently issuable. Additionally, the unvested restricted stock awards subject to time vesting are anti-dilutive for all periods presented and accordingly, have been excluded from the weighted average common shares used to compute diluted EPS. 
 
 Earnings Per Unit of the Operating Partnership 
 Basic earnings (loss) per unit EPU of the Operating Partnership is computed by dividing income (loss) applicable to unitholders by the weighted average Operating Partnership units outstanding, as adjusted for the effect of participating securities. Operating Partnership units granted in equity-based payment transactions are considered participating securities prior to vesting. The impact of unvested Operating Partnership unit awards on EPU has been calculated using the two-class method whereby earnings are allocated to the unvested Operating Partnership unit awards based on distributions and the unvested Operating Partnership units participation rights in undistributed earnings (losses). 
 The calculation of diluted earnings per unit for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 does not include , , and unvested weighted average Operating Partnership units, respectively, as these equity securities are either considered contingently issuable or the effect of including these equity securities was anti-dilutive.

We believe the funds in the escrow account are sufficient for the remaining work to be performed. However, if further work is required costing more than the remaining escrow funds, we could be required to pay such overage, although we may have a contractual claim for such costs against the prior owner or our environmental remediation consultant. 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Our properties are located in Southern California, Northern California, Washington, Oregon, Texas and Hawaii.

 At The Landmark at One Market, we lease, as lessee, a building adjacent to The Landmark at One Market under an operating lease effective through June 30, 2026, which we have the option to extend until 2031 by way of the remaining extension option (the "Annex Lease"). The lease payments under the extension option provided for under the Annex Lease will be equal to the fair rental value at the time the extension option is exercised. The extension option is included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as we are reasonably certain of exercising the extension option. In March 2020, we exercised a extension option to extend the Annex Lease through June 30, 2026, which was memorialized in a lease amendment executed in August 2020 that additionally modified other certain lease payment terms. 
 Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments.

DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES 
 REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE 
 SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 References to we, us, our, or the company mean, unless the context indicates otherwise, American Assets Trust, Inc., not including any of the entities subsidiaries owned or controlled by American Assets Trust, Inc. When we refer to the company s Charter, we mean the company s articles of incorporation, as amended, supplemented and restated from time to time. When we refer to our operating partnership we mean American Assets Trust, L.P. 
 Description of Capital Stock 
 The following is a summary of the general terms of the company s common stock. This description is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Maryland General Corporation Law (or MGCL and our Charter and Bylaws, copies of which are exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 General 
 As of December 31, 2023, the total number of shares of stock of all classes which the company has authority to issue is 500,000,000 shares, consisting of 490,000,000 shares of common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share. Our Charter authorizes the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board of Directors ), with the approval of a majority of the entire Board of Directors and without any action by our stockholders, to amend our Charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock or the number of authorized shares of any class or series of our stock that we have the authority to issue. 
 Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are not personally liable for our debts or obligations solely as a result of their status as stockholders. 
 Common Stock 
 Dividends 
 Subject to the preferential rights of holders of any other class or series of our stock and to the provisions of our Charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions on such shares if, as and when authorized by the Board of Directors out of assets legally available therefor and declared by us and to share ratably in the assets of our company legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up after payment or establishment of reserves for all known debts and liabilities of our company.. 
 Voting Rights 
 Subject to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock and except as may otherwise be specified in the terms of any class or series of our stock, each outstanding share of our common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and the holders of shares of our common stock will possess the exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors. Directors are elected by a plurality of all of the votes cast in the election of directors. 
 Other Rights 
 Holders of shares of our common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights and have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any securities of our company. Our Charter provides that our stockholders generally have no appraisal rights unless the Board of Directors determines prospectively that appraisal rights will apply to one or more transactions in which holders of our common stock would otherwise be entitled to exercise appraisal rights. Subject to the provisions of our Charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, holders of our common stock will have equal dividend, liquidation and other rights. 

Liquidation Rights 
 Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its assets or engage in a statutory share exchange unless declared advisable by its board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. Our Charter provides for approval of any of these matters by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on such matters, except that the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors is required to remove a director and the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter is required to amend the provisions of our Charter relating to the removal of directors, specifying that our stockholders may act without a meeting only by unanimous consent, or specifying the vote required to amend such provisions. Maryland law also permits a Maryland corporation to transfer all or substantially all of its assets without the approval of its stockholders to an entity if all of the equity interests of the entity are owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation. Because our operating assets may be held by our operating partnership or its subsidiaries, these subsidiaries may be able to merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets without the approval of our stockholders. 
 Undesignated Stock 
 Our Charter authorizes the Board of Directors to reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock into other classes or series of stock, to establish the designation and number of shares of each such class or series and to set, subject to the provisions of our Charter relating to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions for redemption of each such class or series. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer 
 In order for us to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made) or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50 of the value of the outstanding shares of stock (after taking into account options to acquire shares of stock) may be owned, directly, indirectly or through application of certain attribution rules by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) at any time during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). 
 Our Charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock that are intended to assist us in complying with these requirements and continuing to qualify as a REIT. The relevant sections of our Charter provide that, subject to the exceptions described below, no person or entity may actually or beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 7.275 (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock, or 7.275 in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock, in each case excluding any shares of our common stock that are not treated as outstanding for federal income tax purposes. We refer to each of these restrictions as an ownership limit and collectively as the ownership limits. A person or entity that would have acquired actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of our stock but for the application of the ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock discussed below is referred to as a prohibited owner. 
 The constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 7.275 of our common stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, our common stock) by an individual or entity, could, nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 7.275 of our outstanding common stock and thereby violate the applicable ownership limit. 

The Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, prospectively or retroactively, may exempt a person from either or both of the ownership limits if doing so would not result in us being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT and our Board of Directors reasonably determines that such waiver will not cause or allow 
 five or fewer individuals to actually or beneficially own more than 49 in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock and 
 subject to certain exceptions, us to own, actually or constructively, more than a 9.9 interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in a tenant of ours (or a tenant of an entity owned in whole or in part by us). 
 As a condition of the exception, our Board of Directors may require an opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, ruling, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to determine or ensure our status as a REIT and such representations, covenants and undertakings from the person requesting the exception as are reasonably necessary or prudent to make the determinations above. The Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with such an exception. 
 In connection with past offerings of our common stock, the Board of Directors has granted to Mr. Rady (and certain of his affiliates) an exemption from the ownership limits that will allow him to own, in the aggregate, up to 19.9 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock, subject to various conditions and limitations. 
 In connection with a waiver of an ownership limit or at any other time, the Board of Directors may, in its sole and absolute discretion, increase or decrease one or both of the ownership limits for one or more persons, except that a decreased ownership limit will not be effective for any person whose actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of our stock exceeds the decreased ownership limit at the time of the decrease until the person s actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of our stock equals or falls below the decreased ownership limit, although any further acquisition of our stock will violate the decreased ownership limit. The Board of Directors may not increase or decrease any ownership limit if, among other limitations, the new ownership limit would allow five or fewer persons to actually or beneficially own more than 49 in value of our outstanding stock or could otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. 
 Our Charter provisions further prohibit 
 any person from actually, beneficially or constructively owning shares of our stock that could result in us being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of our stock that could result in (i) us owning (actually or constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code, or (ii) any manager of a qualified lodging facility, within the meaning of Section 856(d)(9)(D) of the Code, leased by us to one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries failing to qualify as an eligible independent contractor within the meaning of Section 856(d)(9)(A) of the Code, in each case if the income we derive from such tenant or such taxable REIT subsidiary, taking into account our other income that would not qualify under the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code, would cause us to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements imposed on REITs) and 
 any person from transferring shares of our stock if such transfer would result in shares of our stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution). 
 Any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of our stock that will or may violate the ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock described above must give written notice immediately to us or, in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction, provide us at least 15 days prior written notice, and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on our status as a REIT. 

The ownership limits and other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock described above will not apply if our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT or that compliance is no longer required in order for us to qualify as a REIT. 
 Pursuant to our Charter, if any purported transfer of our stock or any other event would otherwise result in any person violating the ownership limits or such other limit established by our Board of Directors, or could result in us being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT, then that number of shares causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) will be automatically transferred to, and held by, a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable organizations selected by us. The prohibited owner will have no rights in shares of our stock held by the trustee. The automatic transfer will be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the violative transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the trust. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the prohibited owner prior to our discovery that the shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above, must be repaid to the trustee upon demand. If the transfer to the trust as described above is not automatically effective, for any reason, to prevent violation of the applicable restriction on ownership and transfer of our stock, then that transfer of the number of shares that otherwise would cause any person to violate the above restrictions will be void. If any transfer of our stock would result in shares of our stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution), then any such purported transfer will be void and of no force or effect and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in the shares. 
 Shares of our stock transferred to the trustee are deemed offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share paid in the transaction that resulted in the transfer of the shares to the trust (or, in the event of a gift, devise or other such transaction, the last reported sale price on the NYSE on the day of the transfer or other event that resulted in the transfer of such shares to the trust) and (2) the last reported sale price on the NYSE on the date we accept, or our designee accepts, such offer. We must reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee and pay the amount of such reduction to the trustee for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary. We have the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of our stock held in the trust. Upon a sale to us, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold terminates and the trustee must distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited owner, and any dividends or other distributions held by the trustee with respect to such stock will be paid to the charitable beneficiary. 
 If we do not buy the shares, the trustee must, within 20 days of receiving notice from us of the transfer of shares to the trust, sell the shares to a person or persons designated by the trustee who could own the shares without violating the ownership limits or other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock. Upon such sale, the trustee must distribute to the prohibited owner an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the price paid by the prohibited owner for the shares (or, if the prohibited owner did not give value in connection with the transfer or other event that resulted in the transfer to the trust (e.g., a gift, devise or other such transaction), the last reported sale price on the NYSE on the day of the transfer or other event that resulted in the transfer of such shares to the trust) and (2) the sales proceeds (net of commissions and other expenses of sale) received by the trustee for the shares. The trustee will reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the prohibited owner will be immediately paid to the charitable beneficiary, together with any dividends or other distributions thereon. In addition, if prior to discovery by us that shares of our stock have been transferred to the trustee, such shares of stock are sold by a prohibited owner, then such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and, to the extent that the prohibited owner received an amount for or in respect of such shares that exceeds the amount that such prohibited owner was entitled to receive, such excess amount shall be paid to the trustee upon demand. 
 The trustee will be designated by us and will be unaffiliated with us and with any prohibited owner. Prior to the sale of any shares by the trust, the trustee will receive, in trust for the charitable beneficiary, all dividends and other distributions paid by us with respect to such shares, and may exercise all voting rights with respect to such shares for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary. 

Subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date that the shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee may, at the trustee s sole discretion 
 rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited owner prior to our discovery that the shares have been transferred to the trust and 
 recast the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary of the trust. 
 However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee may not rescind and recast the vote. 
 If our Board of Directors determines in good faith that a proposed transfer or other event has taken place that violates the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock set forth in our Charter, our Board of Directors may take such action as it deems advisable in its sole discretion to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such transfer, including, but not limited to, causing us to redeem shares of stock, refusing to give effect to the transfer on our books or instituting proceedings to enjoin the transfer. 
 Every owner of 5 or more (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of the outstanding shares of our stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, must give written notice to us stating the name and address of such owner, the number of shares of each class and series of our stock that the owner beneficially owns and a description of the manner in which the shares are held. Each such owner also must provide us with any additional information that we request in order to determine the effect, if any, of the person s actual or beneficial ownership on our status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limits. In addition, any person that is an actual owner, beneficial owner or constructive owner of shares of our stock and any person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding shares of our stock for an actual owner, beneficial owner or constructive owner must, on request, disclose to us such information as we may request in good faith in order to determine our status as a REIT and comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance. 
 Any certificates representing shares of our stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock described above. 
 These restrictions on ownership and transfer could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock that our stockholders believe to be in their best interest. 
 Listing 
 The common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AAT. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. 
 Our Board of Directors 
 Our Charter and Bylaws provide that the number of directors of our company may be established, increased or decreased only by a majority of our entire Board of Directors but may not be fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL nor, unless our Bylaws are amended, more than 15. 
 We have elected by a provision of our Charter to be subject to a provision of Maryland law requiring that, except as otherwise provided in the terms of any class or series of our stock, vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by the remaining directors and that any individual elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. 
 Removal of Directors 
 Our Charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be removed only for cause (as defined in our Charter) and only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of 

directors. This provision, when coupled with the exclusive power of our Board of Directors to fill vacant directorships, may preclude stockholders from removing incumbent directors except for cause and by a substantial affirmative vote and filling the vacancies created by such removal with their own nominees. 
 Business Combinations 
 Under the MGCL, certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in certain circumstances specified under the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any interested stockholder, or an affiliate of such an interested stockholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as 
 any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding voting stock or 
 an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
 A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. In approving a transaction, however, a board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of the approval, with any terms and conditions determined by it. 
 After such five-year period, any such business combination must be recommended by the Board of Directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 
 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and 
 two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom (or with whose affiliate) the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. 
 These supermajority approval requirements do not apply if, among other conditions, the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. 
 These provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a corporation s board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Our Board of Directors has, by board resolution, elected to opt out of the business combination provisions of the MGCL. However, our Board of Directors could opt to be subject to such business combination provisions in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an alteration or repeal of this resolution will not have any effect on any business combinations that have been consummated or upon any agreements existing at the time of such modification or repeal. 
 Control Share Acquisitions 
 The MGCL provides that holders of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights with respect to any control shares except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors, generally, excluding shares of stock in a corporation in respect of which any of the following persons is entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of such shares in the election of directors (1) the person who made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, (2) an officer of the corporation or (3) an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power 
 one-tenth or more but less than one-third 
 one-third or more but less than a majority or 
 a majority or more of all voting power. 

Control shares do not include shares that the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval or shares acquired directly from the corporation. A control share acquisition means the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of ownership of, or the power to direct the exercise of voting power with respect to, issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses and making an acquiring person statement as described in the MGCL), may compel the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the control shares. If no request for a special meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 If voting rights of control shares are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved or, if no such meeting is held, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition. 
 The control share acquisition statute does not apply to (1) shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (2) acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. 
 Our Bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. 
 Subtitle 8 
 Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of the following five provisions 
 a classified board, 
 a two-thirds vote requirement to remove a director, 
 a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by the vote of the directors, 
 a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred, or 
 a majority requirement for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders. 
 We have elected by a provision in our Charter to be subject to the provisions of Subtitle 8 relating to the filling of vacancies on our Board of Directors. Through provisions in our Charter and Bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we already (1) require a two-thirds vote for the removal of any director from the board, which removal will be allowed only for cause, (2) vest in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of directorships, subject to limitations set forth in our Charter and Bylaws, and (3) require, unless called by the chairman of our Board of Directors, our president, our chief executive officer or our Board of Directors, the request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on a matter at such meeting to call a special meeting to consider and vote on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders. We have not elected to create a classified board. In the future, our Board of Directors may elect, without stockholder approval, to create a classified board or elect to be subject to one or more of the other provisions of Subtitle 8. 
 Amendments to Our Charter and Bylaws 
 Other than amendments to certain provisions of our charter described below and amendments permitted to be made without stockholder approval under Maryland law or by a specific provision in the charter, our Charter may 

be amended only if such amendment is declared advisable by our Board of Directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. The provisions of our Charter relating to the removal of directors or specifying that our stockholders may act without a meeting only by unanimous consent, or the provision specifying the vote required to amend such provisions, may be amended only if such amendment is declared advisable by our Board of Directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast not less than two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our Board of Directors has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our Bylaws or to make new bylaws. 
 Transactions Outside the Ordinary Course of Business 
 We generally may not merge with or into, convert into or consolidate with another company, sell all or substantially all of our assets or engage in a statutory share exchange unless such transaction is declared advisable by our Board of Directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. In addition, to the extent that such a merger, conversion, consolidation, sale of assets of statutory share exchange would require the approval of our stockholders, such transaction may also require the approval of the limited partners of our operating partnership. 
 Dissolution of Our Company 
 The dissolution of our company must be declared advisable by a majority of our entire Board of Directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. 
 Meetings of Stockholders 
 Under our Bylaws, annual meetings of stockholders must be held each year at a date, time and place determined by our Board of Directors. Special meetings of stockholders may be called by the chairman of our Board of Directors, our chief executive officer, our president and our Board of Directors. Additionally, subject to the provisions of our Bylaws, a special meeting of stockholders to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders must be called by our secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter at such meeting who have requested the special meeting in accordance with the procedures specified in our Bylaws and provided the information and certifications required by our Bylaws. Only matters set forth in the notice of a special meeting of stockholders may be considered and acted upon at such a meeting. 
 Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business 
 Our Bylaws provide that, with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders at the annual meeting may be made only 
 pursuant to our notice of the meeting 
 by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or 
 by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of the notice required by our Bylaws and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on such other business and who has provided the information and certifications required by the advance notice procedures set forth in our Bylaws. 
 Our Bylaws provide that, with respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting of stockholders, and nominations of individuals for election to our Board of Directors may be made only 
 by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or 
 provided that the meeting has been called for the purpose of electing directors, by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of the notice required by our Bylaws and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated and who has provided the information and certifications required by the advance notice procedures set forth in our Bylaws. 

The purpose of requiring stockholders to give advance notice of nominations and other proposals is to afford our Board of Directors the opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees or the advisability of the other proposals and, to the extent considered necessary by our Board of Directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations regarding the nominations or other proposals. The advance notice procedures also permit a more orderly procedure for conducting our stockholder meetings. 
 Anti-takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws 
 The restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, the provisions of our Charter regarding the removal of directors, the exclusive power of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board and the advance notice provisions of our Bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests. 
 Indemnification and Limitation of Directors and Officers Liability 
 Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision eliminating the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action. Our Charter contains a provision that eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. 
 Our Charter and Bylaws also permit us, with the approval of our Board of Directors, to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of ours as a director or officer and to any employee or agent of our company or a predecessor of our company. 
 We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and directors whereby we have agreed to indemnify such executive officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law against all expenses and liabilities, subject to limited exceptions. These indemnification agreements also provide that, upon an application for indemnity by an executive officer or director to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, such court may order us to indemnify such executive officer or director. 
 The partnership agreement also provides that we, as general partner, and our directors, officers, employees, agents and designees are indemnified to the extent provided therein. 
 Insofar as the foregoing provisions permit indemnification of directors, officers or persons controlling us for liability arising under the Securities Act, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, this indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 
 REIT Qualification 
 Our Charter provides that our Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to be qualified as a REIT.

 3. Recovery of Compensation 
 In the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall recover, reasonably promptly, the portion of any Incentive-Based Compensation that is Erroneously Awarded Compensation, unless the Committee has determined that recovery would be Impracticable.

For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy will not give rise to any person s right to voluntarily terminate employment for good reason, or due to a constructive termination (or any similar term of like effect) under any plan, program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates. 
 4. Manner of Recovery Limitation on Duplicative Recovery 
 The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the manner of recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include, without limitation, reduction or cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of Incentive-Based Compensation or Erroneously Awarded Compensation, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this Policy of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and, to the extent permitted by law, an offset of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation against other compensation payable by the Company or an affiliate of the Company to such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise prohibited by the Applicable Rules, to the extent this Policy provides for recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation already recovered by the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or Other Recovery Arrangements, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation already recovered by the Company from the recipient of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation may be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation required to be recovered pursuant to this Policy from such person.

The Committee may delegate administrative duties with respect to this Policy to one or more directors or employees of the Company, as permitted under applicable law, including any Applicable Rules. 
 6. Interpretation 
 This Policy will be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the extent this Policy is inconsistent with such Applicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure compliance therewith. 
 7. No Indemnification No Liability 
 The Company shall not indemnify or insure any person against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy, nor shall the Company directly or indirectly pay or reimburse any person for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such person may elect to purchase to fund such person s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company or any member of the Committee or the Board shall have any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy. 
 8. Application Enforceability

 10. Amendment and Termination

Three-Year Period means, with respect to a Restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare such Restatement, or, if earlier, the date on which a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare such Restatement. The Three-Year Period also includes any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years identified in the preceding sentence. However, a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months shall be deemed a completed fiscal year.
