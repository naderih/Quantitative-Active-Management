 The indenture trustee has provided the following information for inclusion in this report on Form 10-K 
 
 U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee or successor trustee for certain residential mortgage backed securities RMBS trusts. The complaints, primarily filed by investors or investor groups against U.S. Bank and similar institutions, allege the trustees caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers to comply with the governing agreements for these RMBS trusts. Plaintiffs generally assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failures to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties, notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 
 
 U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors, that it has meritorious defenses, and it has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously. However, U.S. Bank cannot assure you as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. 
 
 On March 9, 2018, a law firm purporting to represent fifteen Delaware statutory trusts (the DSTs that issued securities backed by student loans (the Student Loans filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank in its capacities as indenture trustee and successor special servicer, and three other institutions in their respective transaction capacities, with respect to the DSTs and the Student Loans. This lawsuit is captioned The National Collegiate Student Loan Master Trust I, et al. v. U.S. Bank National Association, et al. , C.A. No. 2018-0167-JRS (Del. Ch.) (the NCMSLT Action ). The complaint, as amended on June 15, 2018, alleged that the DSTs have been harmed as a result of purported misconduct or omissions by the defendants concerning administration of the trusts and special servicing of the Student Loans. Since the filing of the NCMSLT Action, certain Student Loan borrowers have made assertions against U.S. Bank concerning special servicing that appear to be based on certain allegations made on behalf of the DSTs in the NCMSLT Action. 
 
 U.S. Bank has filed a motion seeking dismissal of the operative complaint in its entirety with prejudice pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) or, in the alternative, a stay of the case while other prior filed disputes involving the DSTs and the Student Loans are 
 4 

litigated. On November 7, 2018, the Court ruled that the case should be stayed in its entirety pending resolution of the first-filed cases. On January 21, 2020, the Court entered an order consolidating for pretrial purposes the NCMSLT Action and three other lawsuits pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery concerning the DSTs and the Student Loans, which remains pending. 
 
 U.S. Bank denies liability in the NCMSLT Action and believes it has performed its obligations as indenture trustee and special servicer in good faith and in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the agreements governing the DSTs and that it has meritorious defenses. It has contested and intends to continue contesting the plaintiffs claims vigorously.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 Board of Directors 
 Ally Financial Inc. 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Certification Regarding Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Ally Financial Inc. AFI ), including its wholly owned subsidiary Ally Bank (Ally Bank and AFI are collectively referred to herein as the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the Consumer Automotive Retail Receivables Platform (the Consumer Retail Platform ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) (the servicing criteria ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Consumer Retail Platform. The Consumer Retail Platform consists of the activities involved in the performance of servicing functions for all publicly and privately issued retail asset-backed securitization transactions. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management's assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about management's assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria. The nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of management's assertion on compliance with the servicing criteria, whether due to error or fraud, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Consumer Retail Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed securitization transaction included in the Consumer Retail Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged vendors to perform certain activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that the vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C&DI 200.06 ). As permitted by C&DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C&DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to apply C&DI 200.06. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the engagement. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the Consumer Retail Platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 The Board of Directors 
 U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association 
 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that U.S. Bank National Association and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (collectively, the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform (the Platform ), for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration, registrar and paying agent services, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for servicing criteria Items 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(v), and 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, for the U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.
