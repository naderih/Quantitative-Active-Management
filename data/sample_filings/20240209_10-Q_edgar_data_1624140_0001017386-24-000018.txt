OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE AND OPERATIONS 

Our Business and Recent Developments 

CORETAG HOLDINGS, INC. (Formerly Nine Alliance Science and Technology
Group ), We , or the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 12, 2014, under the
name Paramount Supply Inc. The Company then known as Paramount Supply Inc. last filed a financial report with the SEC on August 25, 2017.
On September 29, 2017, our name was changed to Nine Alliance Science and Technology Group. On August 27, 2020, a motion and application
was made to appoint a Custodian of the Company based on prior management abandoning its responsibilities to continue making filings at
the Nevada Secretary of State s office and for failing to hold a shareholders meeting in over 3 years and otherwise failing
to keep current in its obligations to the Company. Upon motion and application to the District Court, Clark County Nevada, the Court
granted the request for Custodian for the Company Custodian ). Upon granting the motion, the Court issued an
Order acknowledging that the Custodian has performed all of the duties that had been required of it and the management of the Company
will revert exclusively to the officers and directors appointed by the Custodian. In the Revival of the Company, Investment Reserves Series,
as the Custodian of the Company, appointed Joseph Passalaqua as CEO, CFO and Secretary. On June 2, 2023 the Company filed with the State
of Nevada to change the Company name to Coretag Holdings, Inc. 

The Company is a blank check company, as that term is defined
in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with,
nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements, or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or
company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. We are a shell company within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated
pursuant to Securities Act, because we do have no hard assets and real business operations. 

From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating
activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the initial equity funding by our sole officer and director.
We received our initial funding of 4,000 from a previous sole officer and director at that time who purchased 4,000,000 shares of common
stock at 0.001 per share. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

On June 2, 2021, we voluntarily filed a termination of our registration
statement on Form 15-15D pursuant to Rule 15d-6 and our termination becomes effective 90 days thereafter. The Company has since
been seeking a merger target and has been evaluating various opportunities. 

We never sold any securities under the offering statement, so there was
no need to keep the prospectus and Form S-1 filing current. 

 The Company filed a Registration Statement; Form-10-12g on June 16, 2021
and was effective 60 days post filing. We are subject to the requirements of Regulation 13A under the Exchange Act, which require us to
file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and we are required to comply with all
other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers filing registration statements pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.

the Company currently has no business operations. 

 No revenue has been generated in the last two years ended September 30,
2022 and September 30, 2023 and in the three months ended December 31, 2023. 

 We are not currently engaged
in any business operations. We are, however, in the process of attempting to identify, locate, and if warranted, acquire new commercial
opportunities. On June 2, 2023 the Company filed with the State of Nevada to and requested approval for a 2,500-to-1 Reverse Stock Split
of the Issued and Outstanding Shares of Common Stock. The Board Resolutions and Consents have been provided to FINRA and are pending approval.
On June 6, 2023 the Company entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Coretag Holding AG, a German Public Limited Company, following
the Closing date, when the reverse split receives approval, the Company will file a Super 8K with the SEC. 

The authorized capital stock of CORETAG HOLDINGS, INC. consists of
290,000,000 shares of Common Stock, 0.0001 par value per share (the Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,

Critical Accounting Policies 

Going Concern 

We have not attained profitable operations and are
dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment
of profitable operations from our future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern . 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on
our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management s plan includes
obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances; however, there is no
assurance of additional funding being available. 

The Company, as of the date of this report had
approximately 0 in cash and has not earned any revenues from operations to date. For the last three months ending December 31, 2023,
our operating expenses were 14,029. In the previous two fiscal years our operating expenses were 30,181 and 33,890 in the years ended
September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 respectively, consisting primarily of professional fees, administrative expenses and filing
fees. The ongoing expenses of the Company will be related to seeking out a suitable acquisition as well as mandatory filing requirements
including our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of the registration statement filed. 

 The Company continues to rely on borrowings and financings either
arranged by the Company s President or through entities controlled by the President. In the next 12 months we expect to incur expenses
equal to approximately 20,000 related to legal, accounting, audit, and other professional service fees incurred in relation to the Company s
Exchange Act filing requirements. The costs related to the acquisition of a business combination target company vary widely and are dependent
on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of
the target company, the size and complexity of the business of the target company, whether stockholders of the Company prior to the transaction
will retain equity in the Company, the scope of the due diligence investigation required, the involvement of the Company s auditors
in the transaction, possible changes in the Company s capital structure in connection with the transaction, and whether funds may
be raised contemporaneously with the transaction. Therefore, we believe such costs are unascertainable until the Company identifies a
business combination target. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is
currently devoting its efforts to locating merger candidates. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve
profitable operations. 

The Company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations,
is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or
service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital.
Our management believes that the public company status that results from a combination with the Company will provide such company greater
access to the capital markets, increase its visibility in the investment community, and offer the opportunity to utilize its stock to
make acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will in fact have access to additional capital or financing as a public company. In the
alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional
capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant
expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering. 

Our sole officer and director has not had any preliminary contact or discussions
with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially
unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or
earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early
stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized
by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there
can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. 

 Our management anticipates that it will likely be able
to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective
stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business
in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us,
because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another. 

The Company anticipates that the selection of a business
combination will be complex and extremely risky. While the Company is in a competitive market with a small number of business opportunities,
through information obtained from industry professionals including attorneys, investment bankers, and other consultants with experience
in the reverse merger industry, our management believes that there are opportunities for a business combination with firms seeking the
perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include,
among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for
the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees,
and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially
available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the
task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 
 
 17 

We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a finder 
to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses 

We have not established a specific timeline nor have we created
a specific plan to identify an acquisition target and consummate a business combination. We expect that our management and the Company,
through its various contacts and affiliations with other entities will locate a business combination target. We expect that funds in the
amount of approximately 20,000 will be required in order for the Company to satisfy its Exchange Act reporting requirements during the
next 12 months, in addition to any other funds that will be required in order to complete a business combination. Such funds can only
be estimated upon identifying a business combination target. Our management and stockholders have indicated an intent to advance funds
on behalf of the Company as needed in order to accomplish its business plan and comply with its Exchange Act reporting requirements, however,
there are no agreements in effect between the Company and our management or stockholders specifically requiring they provide any funds
to the Company. Therefore, there are no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain the required financing as needed in order to
consummate a business combination transaction. 

The effects of Covid -19 could impact our ability to operate under the going
concern and maintain sufficient liquidity to continue operations. The impact of COVID-19 on companies is evolving rapidly and its future
effects are uncertain. There are material uncertainties from Covid-19 that cast significant doubt on the company s ability to operate
under the going concern. It is possible that our company will have issues relating to the current situation that will need to be considered
by management in the future. There will be a wide range of factors to take into account in going concern judgments and financial projections
including travel bans, restrictions, government assistance and potential sources of replacement financing, financial health of suppliers
and customers and their effect on expected profitability and other key financial performance ratios including information that shows whether
there will be sufficient liquidity to continue to meet obligations when they are due. 

The Company last filed a Form 10K for the year ended September 30, 2023
and will continue to file all required annual and quarterly reports on schedule. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable
operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on
hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock. The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or
obtaining additional funding would be detrimental to the Company. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Default on Notes 

There are currently no notes in default. 

Other Contractual Obligations 

As of the year ended September 30, 2023
and the three months ended December 31, 2023, we did not have any contractual obligations.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company (as defined
in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for by this Item 3.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including Joseph Passalaqua, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to
the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company s limited
resources and lack of employees, management, including Joseph Passalaqua, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2023 and as of the date of this filing, February
8, 2024. 

Management has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting
resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment. Management of the Company believes
that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the Company s accounting staff. The small size of the Company s
accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely
heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting professionals. As we grow,
we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control
framework. 

These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances
that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our financial
statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with
US GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements for the quarter ended December
31, 2023 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all
fraud. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting have
come to management's attention during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect,
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
