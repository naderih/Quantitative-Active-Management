 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 of Boston Properties, Inc. and Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to BXP mean Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation and real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to BPLP and the Operating Partnership mean Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of BPLP. As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has exclusive control of BPLP s day-to-day management. Therefore, unless stated otherwise or the context requires, references to the Company, we, us and our mean collectively BXP, BPLP and those entities/subsidiaries consolidated by BXP. 
 As of December 31, 2023, BXP owned an approximate ownership interest in BPLP. The remaining approximate 10.6 interest was owned by limited partners. The other limited partners of BPLP (1) contributed their direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest in BPLP or (2) received long-term incentive plan units of BPLP pursuant to BXP s Stock Option and Incentive Plans, or both. Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a common unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of BXP s common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by BPLP, however, BXP may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of BXP common stock in exchange for the common units. If BXP so elects, its common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. BXP generally expects that it will elect to issue its common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, BXP s percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever BXP issues shares of its common stock other than to acquire common units of BPLP, BXP must contribute any net proceeds it receives to BPLP and BPLP must issue to BXP an equivalent number of common units of BPLP. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. 
 The Company believes that combining the Annual Reports on Form 10-K of BXP and BPLP into this single report: 
 enhances investors understanding of BXP and BPLP by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both BXP and BPLP; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between BXP and BPLP in the context of how BXP and BPLP operate as a consolidated company. The financial results of BPLP are consolidated into the financial statements of BXP. BXP does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in BPLP, nor does it have employees of its own. BPLP, not BXP, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of BXP. BPLP holds substantially all of the assets of BXP, including ownership interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures. BPLP conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by BXP, which are contributed to the capital of BPLP in exchange for common or preferred units of partnership in BPLP, as applicable, BPLP generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its credit facilities, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and interests in joint ventures. 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of BXP and BPLP. The limited partners of BPLP are accounted for as partners capital in BPLP s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in BXP s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in BPLP s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in BXP s financial statements include the same 

T able of Contents 

 noncontrolling interests in BPLP and limited partners of BPLP. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity issued by each of BXP and BPLP. 
 In addition, the consolidated financial statements of BXP and BPLP differ in total real estate assets resulting from previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets of BXP at the time of such redemptions, resulting in a difference between the net real estate of BXP as compared to BPLP of approximately 242.9 million, or 1.2 at December 31, 2023, and a corresponding difference in depreciation expense, impairment losses and gains on sales of real estate upon the sale of these properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up. The acquisition accounting was nullified on a prospective basis beginning in 2009 as a result of the Company s adoption of a new accounting standard requiring any subsequent redemptions to be accounted for solely as an equity transaction. 
 To help investors better understand the key differences between BXP and BPLP, the following items in this report present information separately for BXP and BPLP: 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities; 
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources, includes information specific to each entity, where applicable;

 Summary of Risk Factors 
 The risk factors detailed in Item 1A titled Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and a reader should carefully consider them. Those risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. The following is a summary of the risk factors detailed in Item 1A: 
 Our performance depends upon the economic conditions, particularly the supply and demand characteristics, of our markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. 
 Market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises or dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. 
 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry, including, without limitation: 
 potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space; 
 potential adverse effects from major clients bankruptcies or insolvencies; 
 potential sustained changes in client preferences and space utilization from full-time, collective in-person work environments to hybrid or remote work models, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 potential delays in completion of development and redevelopment projects due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; and 
 potential increases in costs to maintain, renovate and develop our properties related to inflation. 
 We face potential adverse effects from major clients bankruptcies or insolvencies. 
 Our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs. 
 Our use of joint ventures may limit our control over and flexibility with jointly owned investments and other assets we may wish to acquire. 
 We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. 
 Sustained increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to re-finance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all. 
 Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches, incidents, and compromises through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. 
 We face risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change. 
 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. 
 Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. 
 Our involvement in legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial monetary and other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 We face risks associated with BXP s status as a real estate investment trust (REIT), including, without limitation: 
 failure to qualify as a REIT would cause BXP to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends; 
 possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws could result in increased tax costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders; and 
 in order to maintain BXP s REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. 
 This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 58 .

 PART I 

Item 1 . Business 

General 
 BXP, a Delaware corporation, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, and is one of the largest publicly-traded office REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2023) in the United States that develops, owns and manages primarily premier workplaces. BXP was formed in 1997 to succeed the real estate development, redevelopment, acquisition, management, operating and leasing businesses associated with the predecessor company founded by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in 1970. 
 Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. At December 31, 2023, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 188 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 53.3 million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including 10 properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 2.7 million net rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2023, our properties consisted of: 
 167 office and life sciences properties (including seven properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 14 retail properties (including two properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 six residential properties (including one property under construction); and 
 one hotel. 
 We consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings and are professionally managed and maintained. As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates. Our definition of premier workplaces may be different than those used by other companies. 
 We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services. For this reason, we refer to our tenants as clients due to the many facets of our continuous engagements with them, which span beyond the usual tenant/landlord relationship. Throughout this Annual Report, we use the terms tenant and client interchangeably. 
 BXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner. Our principal executive office and Boston regional office are located at The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 2800 28th Street, Suite 170, Santa Monica, California 90405, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111, 1001 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98154 and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20037. 
 Our internet address is http://www.bxp.com. On our website, you can obtain free copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. You may also obtain BXP s and BPLP s reports by accessing the EDGAR database at the SEC s website at http://www.sec.gov, or we will furnish an electronic or paper copy of these reports free of charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, Boston Properties, Inc., Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199. Boston Properties is a registered trademark, BXP is a registered trademark, and the bxp logo is a registered trademark, in all cases, owned by BPLP. 
 Boston Properties Limited Partnership 
 BPLP is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1997, and the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP and, as of February 20, 2024, the owner of approximately 89.1 of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP and (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP LTIP Units ), for which all performance conditions have been satisfied for such conversion. We exclude from (1) and (2) above other LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards in 
 3 

T able of Contents 

 2022 or later MYLTIP Awards ), which remain subject to performance conditions. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned. 
 
 Transactions During 2023 
 Acquisition 
 On December 14, 2023, we acquired our joint venture partner s 45 interest in the joint venture entity that owns Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California. Santa Monica Business Park is a 47-acre office park consisting of 21 buildings totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet. Approximately 70 of the rentable square footage is subject to a ground lease with 75 years remaining, including renewal periods. The ground lease provides the right to purchase the land underlying the properties in 2028 with subsequent purchase rights every 15 years (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness of 300.0 million that bears interest at a variable rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 1.38 per annum and matures on July 19, 2025. Upon acquisition, BPLP assumed interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating 300.0 million to fix SOFR, the reference rate for the mortgage loan, at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.679 per annum for a period that ends on April 1, 2025. These interest rate swap contracts were entered into to reduce the exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the interest rate associated with the mortgage loan (See Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of 38.0 million, and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 20 million. Prior to the acquisition, we had a 55 interest in the joint venture and accounted for it under the equity method of accounting. The acquisition resulted in our full ownership of the joint venture such that we now account for its assets, liabilities and operations on a consolidated basis in our financial statements (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Developments /Redevelopments 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 10 properties under construction/redevelopment, which we expect will total approximately 2.7 million net rentable square feet when completed. We estimate our share of the aggregate total investment to complete these projects is approximately 2.4 billion, of which approximately 1.3 billion remained to be invested as of December 31, 2023. The total development pipeline, inclusive of office, laboratory/life sciences and retail developments, but excluding Skymark - Reston Next Residential, is 53 pre-leased as of February 20, 2024. For a detailed list of the properties under construction/redevelopment see Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 On January 5, 2023, we commenced the development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately 566,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Concurrently with the commencement of this project, the Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service and demolished to support the development of this project. 290 Binney Street is 100 pre-leased to AstraZeneca. There can be no assurance that we will complete development of the project on the terms and schedule currently contemplated or at all. On November 13, 2023, we entered into agreements to sell a 45 interest in each of 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street to an institutional investor (see below transaction for disclosures concerning 300 Binney Street). This interest sale of 290 Binney Street is expected to close in 2024. There can be no assurance that we will complete the interest sale of 290 Binney Street on the terms currently contemplate or at all. 
 On January 30, 2023, we commenced the redevelopment of 300 Binney Street at Kendall Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 300 Binney Street consisted of an approximately 195,000 net rentable square foot premier workplace that is being redeveloped into approximately 236,000 net rentable square feet of laboratory/life sciences space. BXP and BPLP recognized approximately 11.0 million of depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the acceleration of depreciation on the assets being removed from service and demolished as part of the redevelopment of the property. The project is 100 pre-leased to the Broad Institute. On November 13, 2023, we entered into agreements to sell a 45 interest in each of 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street to an institutional investor (see above transaction for disclosures concerning 290 Binney Street). Upon entry into each of the agreements, we completed the sale of a 45 interest in 300 Binney Street. The institutional investor funded approximately 212.9 million in cash at closing for its investment in 300 Binney Street, including future costs to fund completion of the development project. We will retain a 55 ownership

 interest in the joint venture and fund all remaining costs of the development (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 On April 29, 2023, we completed and fully placed in-service 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, a premier workplace project with approximately 476,000 net rentable square feet located in Washington, DC.

 Business and Growth Strategies 
 Business Strategies 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return at all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective are: 
 to target a few carefully selected dynamic gateway markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, developers, owners and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise. We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective clients in various industries and where clients have demonstrated a preference for premier workplaces and other facilities. Additionally, our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. We have explored, and may continue to explore for future investment, select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits; 
 to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office and life sciences space, as well as selected retail and residential space; 
 to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue; 
 to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today s clients who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, including those amenities that enrich in-person experiences and support a hybrid work environment, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients; 
 to opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing; 
 to explore joint venture or lending opportunities with existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital; 
 to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential; 
 to seek third-party development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and 
 to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations. 
 Growth Strategies 
 External Growth Strategies 
 We believe that our development experience, our organizational depth, utilization of our joint venture partner relationships and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of premier workplaces, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office properties and life sciences space, within budget and on schedule. We believe we are also well-positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include: 
 9 

T able of Contents 

 our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support approximately 18.9 million additional square feet of new development; 
 our reputation gained through 54 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties; 
 our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services; 
 our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry; 
 our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas; 
 our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; 
 our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets; 
 our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us; and 
 our relationship with domestic and foreign investors who seek to partner with companies like ours. 
 Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories: 
 Development in selected submarkets. We believe the selected development of well-positioned premier workplaces, including office, life sciences, residential buildings and mixed-use complexes may be justified in our markets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 54-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land or buildings with development or redevelopment potential. 
 In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment. 
 Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. 
 Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions, including lenders, or individuals. We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions. Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXP s common stock may facilitate these types of acquisitions on a tax-efficient basis. Existing promulgated Treasury regulations may limit the tax benefits previously available to sellers in some variations of these transactions.

T able of Contents 

 Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets . We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions, owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program. 
 Internal Growth Strategies 
 We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations. Additionally, our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space, resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage clients to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing clients through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and (3) to work with new or existing clients with space expansion or contraction needs, leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to: 
 Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit clients. In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers and amenities, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors. 
 The weighted-average lease term of our in-place leases based on square feet, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.8 years at December 31, 2023, and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable clients. In 2023, we executed approximately 4.2 million square feet of leases with a weighted-average lease term of 8.2 years. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2023, leases with respect to approximately 5.8 of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2024. 
 Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for client retention. We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to client needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in client relations. In addition, we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our clients. 
 Replace clients quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs . We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new clients and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to clients, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets. 
 Extend terms of existing leases to existing clients prior to expiration . We have also successfully structured early client renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy clients on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships. 
 Re-development of existing assets. We believe the select re-development of assets within our portfolio, where through the ability to increase the building size and/or to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the asset s current and future cash flows, may be desirable. This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the building s size, improve building systems, including conversion to higher yielding life sciences uses, and sustainability features, and/or add client amenities, thereby increasing client demand, generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the long-term value of the property and the company. In the past, we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for

 increased density at several of our assets, providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location. Our strong regional relationships and recognized re-development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles. 
 
 Sustainability 
 Our Strategy 
 We actively work to promote our growth and operations sustainably and responsibly across our six dynamic gateway markets. BXP s sustainability strategy is to conduct our business, the development, ownership and operation of new and existing buildings, in a manner that contributes to positive economic, social and environmental outcomes for our clients, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. Our investment philosophy is shaped by our core strategy of long-term ownership and our commitment to our communities and the centers of commerce and civic life that make them thrive. We are focused on developing and maintaining healthy, high-performance buildings, while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste, greenhouse gas GHG emissions and climate change. Positive social impact is also of great importance to BXP and our employees, which is exhibited by our commitments to charitable giving, volunteerism, public realm investments and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace and our communities. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and broader society while mutually benefiting our stakeholders. 
 Sustainability Leadership 
 We continue to address the needs of our stakeholders by making efforts to maintain and improve our performance across three pillars: climate action, climate resilience and social good. BXP is a widely recognized industry leader in sustainability, and our 2023 highlights include:

 Our leadership position is due, in part, to our establishment of environmental goals, the periodic reporting of progress toward our goals and the achievement of these goals. We have publicly adopted energy, emissions, water, building certification and waste goals that establish targets aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As of the end of 2022, the combined impacts of efficiency measures and renewable energy consumption resulted in a 39 decrease in energy use intensity and over 70 reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity below a 2008 base year. We have also aligned our emissions reduction targets with climate science and in 2020 became the first North American office REIT to establish an emissions reduction target ambition in line with a 1.5 C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission under the Science Based Targets initiative. In April 2021, we affirmed our commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations (for direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions) by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control. BXP s carbon-neutral goal progress and key performance indicator data is updated annually in our Sustainability and Impact Report, published in April.

 We are focused on developing, owning and operating healthy and high-performance buildings. BXP is a corporate member of the U.S. Green Building Council USGBC and has a long history of green buildings under USGBC s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED rating system. As of December 31, 2023, we had LEED-certified 33.4 million square feet of our total in-service portfolio, of which 92 was certified at the highest Gold and Platinum levels. In 2018, we announced a partnership with a leading healthy building certification system, Fitwel, to support healthy building design and operational practices across our portfolio, becoming a Fitwel Champion. We completed our Fitwel Champion commitments and have added 25.0 million square feet of Fitwel-certified buildings across our total in-service portfolio since 2018. 
 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB Disclosures 
 The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB in 2018 proposed sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information. The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area Energy Intensity percentage of the eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR ENERGY STAR certified total energy consumed by portfolio area Total Energy Consumption water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area Water Intensity and total water withdrawn by portfolio area Total Water Consumption ). Our energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and is assured by an independent, third-party assurance expert, which includes all 2022 SASB energy and water metrics. For more information on the independent, third-party assurance expert and the methodology used to assure the data, refer to Reporting below. During the 2022 calendar year, 47 buildings representing 43 of our eligible portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified. A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications. 
 The charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2022 for which data were available on occupied and actively managed buildings where we had operational control. 1,2,3,4,5,6 
 
 _______________ 
 (1) Full 2023 calendar year energy and water data will not be available and assured by a third party until April 22, 2024. Therefore, 2022 is the most recent year for which complete and third-party assured energy and water data is available. 
 (2) The charts reflect the performance of our occupied and actively managed portfolio. We define occupied buildings as those with no more than 50 vacancy. Actively managed buildings are those over which we have operational control of building system performance and investment decisions. At the end of the 2022 calendar year, our occupied and actively managed portfolio included 96 buildings totaling 42.8 million gross square feet, and it accounted for approximately 77 of BXP s total in-service portfolio by area. 
 (3) Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when we obtain energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the calendar year, regardless of when such data was obtained. 
 (4) The scope of energy includes energy purchased from sources external to us and our clients or produced by us or our clients and energy from all sources, including fuel, gas, electricity and steam. Energy use intensity (kBtu/SF) has been weather-normalized.

 Climate Resilience 
 As a long-term owner and active manager of real estate assets in operation and under development, we take a long-term view of climate change risks and opportunities. We are focused on understanding how climate change may impact the performance of our portfolio and the steps we can take to increase climate resilience. We continue to evaluate the potential risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio and are taking proactive steps to plan for and/or mitigate such risks. 
 Governance 
 As a vertically integrated, full-service real estate company, we are engaged in addressing climate-related issues at all levels of our organization. Our Board of Directors has established a board-level Sustainability Committee to, among other things, increase Board oversight over environmental and sustainability issues, including climate-related risks and opportunities. The Board delegated to the Sustainability Committee the responsibility to oversee BXP s sustainability program, which includes monitoring and addressing, as needed, environmental-, sustainability- and climate-related risks. Management s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks, opportunities and initiatives is spread across multiple teams throughout our organization, including our executive leadership and our Sustainability, Risk Management, Development, Construction and Property Management Departments. BXP has a dedicated team of sustainability professionals focused on coordinating and collaborating across corporate and regional teams to advance environmental sustainability issues and initiatives. 
 Our approach to climate-related issues is also informed by robust stakeholder engagement. We are in frequent dialogue with investors, customers, community members, governmental policymakers, consultants and other non-governmental organizations. We are heavily involved in industry associations and participate in conferences and workshops covering sustainability and climate resilience topics. Through these engagements, we enhance our knowledge of climate-related issues and those issues that are most important to our stakeholders and industry best practices. 
 Strategy 
 We have aligned our climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures TCFD ). The TCFD framework has informed the development of our strategy for identifying and managing both physical and transition risks associated with climate change. As defined by the TCFD framework, physical risks associated with climate change include acute risks (extreme weather-related events) and chronic risks (such as extreme heat and sea-level rise), and transition risks associated with climate change include policy and legal risks, and other technology, market and reputation-related risks. 
 We continue to proactively assess the potential risks that may impact the properties in our portfolio, gather information and monitor the evolving regulatory landscape related to climate change. Our process for assessing climate-related risks and their implications on our properties and business includes a climate change scenario analysis that was conducted in 2021 on our portfolio assets and will be updated in 2024. In particular, we engaged Moody s ESG Solutions (formerly branded as the Four Twenty Seven Application), an independent provider of science-driven insights and analytics on climate risk, for its climate risk scoring to evaluate the forward-looking physical climate risk exposure of our entire portfolio. The scenario analysis and physical risk scoring were based on an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, which is a worst-case, high-emissions scenario, under a time horizon up to 2040. The scenario analysis included all in-service assets owned by BXP and included climate events such as hurricanes, wildfires, heat, water stress, flooding and sea-level rise. We are also using climate risk data to identify potential risks during the new acquisition diligence process. The analysis of our portfolio in 2021 yielded no material findings. 
 We consider climate-related risks and opportunities in the context of the following time horizons: short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (3-10 years) and long-term (>10 years). Based on the foregoing process for evaluating climate-related risks, including the scenario analysis, we have identified (1) the following potential physical and transition risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio in the future across the stated time horizons and (2) our climate-related opportunities. We will continue to analyze the results of climate risk analyses, including the following risks and opportunities to understand our potential exposure and inform our climate resilience strategy and future investments, which include climate-related risk mitigation and initiatives.

 Time Period Physical Risks Short- to Medium-Term Increased severity of extreme weather events, including flooding and wind damage, extreme heat and sea-level rise may cause one or more of the following to occur: 
 Direct damage to properties 
 Increased costs of property insurance and snow removal 
 Supply chain disruption 
 Costs associated with capital expenditures and infrastructure-related remediation projects 
 Alteration of designs at new and existing buildings 
 Increased costs of real estate taxes or other assessments 
 
 Long-Term Building adaptation, including architectural and mechanical improvements, could increase capital expenditure requirements. 
 Extreme drought and wildfires could adversely impact demand in markets prone to water scarcity and annual wildfire risk. 
 Sea-level rise and extreme weather events could make property insurance unavailable in high-risk areas. 
 Public transportation system disruptions could impact access to BXP buildings. 
 Chronic climate-related physical risks and associated downtime could result in declining demand for office space at impacted buildings. 
 Time Period Transition Risks Short- to Medium-Term Non-compliance with regulatory requirements, including energy and carbon performance standards, may increase costs and/or introduce potential fines. 
 Compliance with green building codes, including electrification of heating systems, may increase development and operational costs. 
 Failure to meet sustainability needs (e.g., net-zero requirements) of clients and investors could result in lost business. 
 Additional growth, particularly in life sciences, may increase energy and emissions intensities. 
 Long-Term Real estate taxes may increase to fund public projects to improve regional and neighborhood-scale resilience. Time Period Mitigation Other Opportunities Short-Term Energy and carbon reductions could result in greater product differentiation and competitive advantage. 
 Stronger sustainability disclosures, particularly regarding climate action and resilience, may qualify BXP for greater inclusion in sustainability ETFs and other funds. 
 BXP may benefit from a lower cost of capital from green bonds and/or sustainability-linked credit. 
 BXP may avoid operating cost increases from rising energy costs through actions focused on efficient operations. 
 Medium-Term BXP may avoid penalties associated with building energy and carbon performance standards. 
 Assets may be converted and/or certified net-zero, which may increase demand for office space. 
 Long-Term By focusing on the risks of climate change associated with acute and chronic physical risks during the development, acquisition and operating life of assets, BXP may mitigate losses and downtime resulting from extreme weather events.

 Risk Management 
 BXP is committed to managing and avoiding the impacts of climate change. Our risk management program includes physical and transition risks, including both climate mitigation (resource efficiency and emissions reduction) and adaptation (integration of climate resilience into our investment decision-making). We are actively acquiring, developing and operating a geographically diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate properties. Individual assets have unique risk profiles and insurance requirements. Through the processes of acquisition, development and operation of our in-service portfolio, our experienced real estate professionals are identifying risks, including business continuity risks, loss exposure related to extreme weather events and impacts of regulation, including permitting requirements, codes, and energy and carbon performance standards. The climate risk profile of each property is largely dependent on the property s unique attributes, physical location and jurisdictional regulatory requirements. 
 Asset-Level Risk Management 
 We carry all-risk property insurance on our properties including those under development. Insurance coverage mitigates the impact on BXP from losses associated with natural catastrophes, such as floods, fires, earthquakes and wind events. 
 We are preparing for long-term climate risk by considering climate change scenarios and expect that we will continue to assess climate change vulnerabilities resulting from potential future climate scenarios and sea-level rise. We will continue to evaluate existing plans and procedures and proactively implement practical, cost-effective resiliency measures and infrastructure enhancements, including: 
 Business Continuity Plans 
 Emergency Response and Life Safety Plans 
 Emergency Evacuation Planning, Procedures and Drills 
 Client Engagement and Coordination 
 Life Safety Analysis 
 Elevation of vault, switchgear and critical equipment during new development 
 Waterproofing of subgrade infrastructure 
 Floodable first floors 
 Temporary flood barriers 
 Backup generation, emergency lighting and fire pumps 
 Onsite energy resources and distributed generation, storage and solar photovoltaic systems. 
 We are managing transition risks by benchmarking energy, carbon, water and waste performance at the asset level and are prioritizing interventions at underperforming assets. We develop, operate and maintain a large portfolio of buildings that are LEED, ENERGY STAR and/or Fitwel certified. As of December 31, 2023, 91 of our actively managed portfolio was certified under one or more of these frameworks. As a leader in green building, we will continue to make investments in building performance, energy efficiency and decarbonization. 
 Through our climate action efforts, we believe we can play a leading role in advancing the transition to a low-carbon economy and are taking action to decarbonize operations. GHG sources include the generated electricity and steam at offsite generation facilities, the onsite combustion of fuels (e.g., natural gas), and emissions associated with other business activities, including business travel and new development. We continue to explore and implement creative and cost-effective measures that reduce GHG emissions from our operations. 
 BXP became a proud signatory of the We Are Still In pledge after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and has aligned emissions reduction targets with climate science. In 2020, the SBTi Target Validation Team classified BXP s emissions reduction target ambition and determined that it is in line with a 1.5 C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission. We are committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations, or net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, which includes direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control.

 BXP s Carbon-Neutral Operations Strategy 
 Our strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations includes the following goals: 
 (1) Energy Efficient Operations Approximately 1/3 of total carbon reductions by 2025 (below a 2008 base year) from energy conservation and efficient operations. 
 (2) Renewable Energy Advancement of onsite development of renewable energy systems and sourcing offsite renewable energy to meet 100 of our electricity needs by 2025. 
 (3) Electrification Explore and advance electrification, prioritizing electrification of new developments and replacement of onsite gas-fired systems at existing buildings at the end of their useful lives. 
 (4) Carbon Offsets To the extent necessary, offset any remaining emissions during the transition to carbon-free energy. 
 The resilience of our markets may depend on the action taken by cities to adapt transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure for extreme heat, weather events, sea-level rise and flooding. We will continue to encourage the adaptation of our cities and management of physical and transition risks by maintaining a voice in policy decision-making at the local level through direct engagement and/or advocacy through collective membership-based groups. 
 Metrics 
 We closely monitor energy consumption and associated GHG emissions and provide a detailed accounting of sustainability key performance indicators in our annual sustainability reporting. As of the end of 2022, the combined impacts of efficiency measures and renewable energy consumption resulted in a 39 decrease in energy use intensity and an over 70 reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity below a 2008 base year. BXP s carbon-neutral commitment includes direct and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our actively managed portfolio where we have operational control. Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions include emissions associated with landlord-controlled energy use within our multi-tenant buildings. Scope 1 GHG emissions include all emissions associated with the onsite combustion of fossil fuels for heating, hot water and standby generators. Scope 2 GHG emissions include all emissions associated with the offsite generation of electricity and steam. As our business continues to grow, carbon reduction targets and the transparent disclosure of sustainability metrics will remain a priority. 
 
 Reporting 
 A notable part of our commitment to sustainable development and operations is our commitment to transparent reporting of sustainability performance indicators, as we recognize the importance of this information to investors, lenders and others in understanding how BXP assesses sustainability information and evaluates risks and opportunities. We publish an annual Sustainability Impact Report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Framework, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the SASB Framework. BXP s Sustainability Impact Report includes our strategy, key performance indicators, annual like-for-like comparisons and achievements. The report is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading Commitment. Our annual sustainability reports, including all of our energy, water and emissions metrics included therein, are assured by an independent, third-party assurance expert. The assurance expert performs an independent verification for certain of our performance indicators and issues an opinion, which is attached to each sustainability report, that opines on each sustainability report s inclusiveness, materiality, sustainability context, completeness and reliability. 
 We have been an active participant in the green bond market since 2018, which provides access to sustainability-focused investors interested in the positive environmental externalities of our business activities. Since 2018, BPLP has issued an aggregate of 5.1 billion of green bonds in six separate offerings. The terms of the green bonds have restrictions that limit our allocation of the net proceeds to eligible green projects. We publish Green Bond Allocation Reports disclosing the full or partial allocation, as applicable, of net proceeds from the green bond offerings to eligible green projects. We have published four Green Bond Allocation Reports that have allocated more than 2.7 billion in net proceeds to eligible green projects, with the remaining 823.8 million to be allocated to future eligible green projects pending final LEED certifications. The Green Bond Allocation Reports are available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading Commitment. 
 Except for the documents specifically incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 By providing a quality workplace and comprehensive benefit programs, we recognize the commitment of our employees to bring their talent, energy and experience to us. Our continued success is attributable to our employees expertise and dedication. Our workforce, as referred to in this section, excludes intern employees and union employees for which the unions control primary aspects of the hiring process. 
 We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys to monitor our employees satisfaction in different aspects of their employment, including company performance, leadership, communication, career development and benefits offerings. Past employee responsiveness to the engagement surveys has been consistently high and the results help inform us on matters that our employees view as key contributors to a positive work experience. We intend to continue to periodically evaluate employee engagement as needed on a meaningful basis. 
 Another indicator of the success of our efforts in the workplace is the long tenure of our employees, 33 of whom have worked at BXP for ten or more years. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 9.2 years and that of our officers is 18.5 years. In 2023, our voluntary workforce turnover rate was 10.4 . 
 Career Development Training 
 We invest significant resources in our employees personal and professional growth and development and provide a wide range of tools and development opportunities that build and strengthen employees leadership and professional skills. These development opportunities include in-person and virtual training sessions, in-house learning opportunities, various management trainings, departmental conferences, executive townhalls and external programs. We foster an environment of growth and internal promotion and strive for a best-in-class candidate experience for our internal applicants. Open positions are posted, and employees are highly encouraged to apply for promotion within the organization. For 2023, 12 of our employees were promoted to elevated roles within our organization. Of the employees promoted, 51 were women and 28 were ethnically diverse. 
 Compensation Benefits 
 We designed our compensation program with the goal of providing a balanced and effective way of ensuring internal equity and market competitiveness in our pay practices. We have coupled external, market-driven data with an equitable performance review assessment tool to strike the balance that best represents our compensation strategy and links pay to performance. On an annual basis, our Human Resources department evaluates market compensation ranges for each position to ensure we are appropriately compensating our top performers. We believe this total rewards program directly aligns with our compensation and benefits strategy. 
 Our employee benefit programs are designed to meet the needs of our diverse workforce, support our employees and their families by offering comprehensive and competitive programs that provide flexibility and choice in coverage, make available valuable resources to protect and enhance financial security and help balance work and personal life. Some of the benefits that we offer our employees include:

 Health, Safety Wellness 
 As one of the largest publicly traded premier workplace REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2023) in the United States, we are keenly aware of the influence of buildings on human health and its importance to our clients and employees. The health, safety and security of our employees, clients, contractors and others are our highest priority. We have implemented numerous operational measures to address health and safety in our buildings, including measures related to indoor air quality in our buildings. For example, we have (i) installed indoor air quality monitoring devices across approximately 40 buildings that continue to provide real-time indoor air quality data, (ii) maintain enhanced air filtration in buildings and (iii) continue to conduct air and water quality testing. 
 We believe the success of our employees is dependent upon their overall well-being, including their physical health, mental health, work-life balance and financial well-being. In addition to the benefits outlined above, we also offer our employees an Employee Wellness Program, an Employee Assistance Program and a Mental Health Well-Being Program. The Employee Wellness Program was established in 2016 to encourage employees to improve their health and well-being by offering a variety of activities and engaging content to meet individual wellness goals. Program participants receive a reduction in their health insurance deduction cost. The Employee Assistance Program includes services for childcare, eldercare, personal relationship information, financial planning assistance, stress management, mental illness and general wellness and self-help. BXP offers a premium mental health program that provides online resources and support for employees facing a wide variety of issues. 
 
 Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 
 The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by BXP s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors. 
 Investment Policies 
 Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 
 Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives. 
 We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development and redevelopment projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment in select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants. 
 We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio. 
 Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP s common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). 
 Investments in Real Estate Mortgages and Mezzanine Debt 
 While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other 
 21 

T able of Contents 

 types of real estate interests consistent with BXP s qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership. As of December 31, 2023, we had one note receivable and two related party note receivables outstanding, which totaled approximately 92.2 million, after adjustments for financing costs and the current expected credit loss allowance. 
 Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities 
 Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 
 Dispositions 
 We decide to dispose or partially dispose of properties based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that doing so is in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale. As of December 31, 2023, we had one property that was subject to a tax protection agreement, which may limit our ability to dispose of the asset or require us to pay damages to the prior owner in the event of a taxable sale in violation of the agreement. The tax protection agreement expires on December 14, 2033, or earlier if certain conditions by the prior owner are met. 
 Financing Policies 
 The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole. However, our mortgages, credit facilities, joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. In addition, we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLP s publicly traded debt. A reduction in BPLP s credit ratings could result in us borrowing money at higher interest rates. 
 The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the cost and effectiveness of entering into interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. 
 Policies with Respect to Other Activities 
 As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in circumstances or to the Code, the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property. We intend to make investments in such a way that 
 22 

T able of Contents 

 we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP. 
 Governmental Regulations 
 General 
 Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, (1) federal securities laws and regulations, (2) applicable stock exchange requirements, and (3) federal, state and local laws and regulations related to (a) our status as a REIT and other tax laws and regulations, and (b) real property, the improvements thereon and the operation thereof, such as laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, zoning, usage, building, fire and life safety codes, (4) the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury and (5) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition to the discussion below, see Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, and see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings. 
 Environmental Matters 
 It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. 
 For example, in February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. 
 Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. 
 Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or 
 23 

T able of Contents 

 include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have developed an office park on this property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. 
 We expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

 Competition 
 We compete in the leasing of premier workplace, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc. 
 Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing premier workplaces are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of client services and amenities provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of premier workplaces in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective clients, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 
 In addition, we currently have residential properties (including one under construction) and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties. As an owner, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators/owners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. 
 Our Hotel Property 
 We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income, while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns the profit or loss from operating the property as a hotel. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and they should be carefully considered. Throughout this section, we refer to the equity and debt securities of both BXP and BPLP as our securities, and the investors who own securities of BXP, BPLP or both, as our securityholders. These risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 58 . 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 
 Our performance depends upon the economic conditions, particularly the supply and demand characteristics, of our markets Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. 
 Substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in six markets: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. A downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space and/or a reduction in rents. Because our portfolio consists primarily of premier workplace buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for workplaces in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. For example, in our Washington, DC market, we focus on leasing our properties to governmental agencies and contractors. In our West Coast market, our leasing is focused on clients in the technology and media industries, as well as legal firms. In addition, in our New York market, we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. A reduction in spending by the Federal Government, sustained changes in space utilization due to remote work models, and/or a significant downturn in one or more of the foregoing sectors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, reduced demand for office space and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 In addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an other than temporary impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. An other than temporary impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset (1) is not recoverable over its expected holding period and (2) exceeds its fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in four unconsolidated joint ventures aggregating approximately 272.6 million (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken. 
 Market and economic volatility due to adverse economic and geopolitical conditions, health crises or dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by market and economic volatility experienced by the U.S. and global economies, the real estate industry as a whole and/or the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located. Such adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may be due to, among other issues, prolonged labor market challenges impacting the recruitment and retention of talent, continued inflation, high interest rates, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, and international economic and other conditions, including pandemics, geopolitical instability and other conditions beyond our control. These current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and/or distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences: 
 the financial condition of our clients may be adversely affected, which may result in client defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or for other reasons; 
 significant job losses and/or a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate may occur, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 26 

T able of Contents 

 tightening labor market conditions may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain talent, which may result in lack of business continuity and increased costs to address the labor challenges; 
 our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense; 
 reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; 
 the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors; 
 one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and 
 to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments. 
 Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. 
 We depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly Owen D. Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, Douglas T. Linde, President, and Raymond A. Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President. Among the reasons that Messrs. Thomas, Linde and Ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors. If we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential clients and industry personnel could diminish. 
 Our Chief Financial Officer and Regional Managers also have strong reputations. Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with clients and build-to-suit prospects. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective clients and industry personnel. 
 Risks Related to Real Estate 
 Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry. 
 Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties: 
 downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment); 
 changes in client preferences and space utilization from full-time, collective in-person work environments to hybrid or remote work models, which could decrease overall demand for workplaces and cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 competition from other office, life sciences, hotel, retail and residential buildings; 
 local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, life sciences, hotel, retail or residential space; 
 changes in interest rates and availability of financing; 
 vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space; 
 27 

T able of Contents 

 delays in completion of development and redevelopment projects due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; 
 increased costs to maintain, renovate and develop our properties related to inflation; 
 changes in space utilization by our clients due to technology, economic conditions and business culture; 
 increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs; 
 civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our clients in impacted locations; 
 significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes (including reassessments and changes in tax laws), insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property; 
 declines in the financial condition of our clients and our ability to collect rents from our clients; and 
 decreases in the underlying value of our real estate. 
 We face potential adverse effects from major clients bankruptcies or insolvencies. 
 The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major client may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. Our clients could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. We cannot evict a client solely because of its bankruptcy. On the other hand, a bankrupt client may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations. On November 6, 2023, WeWork Inc. and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, WeWork filed voluntary petitions to commence proceedings under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. As of December 31, 2023, WeWork was one of our 20 largest clients (based on our share of square footage). There can be no assurance that WeWork will not reject one or more of the leases. 
 Our properties face significant competition. 
 We face significant competition from developers, owners and managers of office, life sciences and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our clients. Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain clients and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties. 
 We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space. 
 We derive most of our income from rent received from our clients. If a client experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, when our clients decide not to renew their leases, renew for less space or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space or there could be a substantial delay in re-letting the space. Even if clients decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to clients, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. As a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected. 
 Our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs. 
 We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, life sciences, retail and residential properties. Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks: 
 we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all; 
 28 

T able of Contents 

 we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, increases in interest rates, or supply chain disruptions, any of which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs; 
 we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project; 
 we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and, as a result, we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred; 
 we may expend funds on and devote management s time to projects that we do not complete; 
 we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule or at all; and 
 we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted. 
 Investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated. 
 Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks: 
 we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than projected, or at a slower pace than projected, at the time we decide to undertake the development; 
 operating expenses and construction costs may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and 
 occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all. 
 We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. 
 We operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as mixed-use developments. This means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial purposes. We have less experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate than we do with office real estate. As a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. If we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. In addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). In the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because we have less experience with residential properties than with office and retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. If we hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us. 
 Our use of joint ventures may limit our control over and flexibility with jointly owned investments and other assets we may wish to acquire. 
 In appropriate circumstances, we intend to acquire and recapitalize or develop, as applicable, properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities. We currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated 
 29 

T able of Contents 

 within our financial statements. Our participation in joint ventures subjects us to risks, including but not limited to, the following risks that: 
 our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property, its operation or, if applicable, the commencement of development activities, and a dispute with any of our joint venture partners could lead to the sale of a partner s ownership interest in the venture or the property at a time or price that we do not find attractive; 
 some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and, depending on credit market conditions, the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls; 
 our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest, including with respect to our compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with REIT requirements; 
 our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest; 
 our joint venture partners may default on their obligations, which could necessitate that we fulfill their obligations ourselves; 
 our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them; 
 our joint venture agreements may contain provisions limiting the liquidity of our interest for sale or sale of the entire asset; 
 as the general partner or managing member of a joint venture, we could be generally liable under applicable law for the debts and obligations of the venture, and we may not be entitled to contribution or indemnification from our partners; 
 our joint venture agreements may contain provisions that allow our partners to remove us as the general partner or managing member for cause, and this could result in liability for us to our partners under the governing agreement of the joint venture; and 
 we may need our partner(s) approval to take certain actions and, therefore, we may be unable to cause a joint venture to implement decisions that we consider advisable. 
 We face the risk that third parties will not be able to service or repay loans we make to them. 
 From time to time, we have loaned and in the future may loan funds to (1) a third-party buyer to facilitate the sale of an asset by us to such third party, or (2) a third party in connection with the formation of a joint venture to acquire and/or develop a property. Making these loans subjects us to the following risks, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and/or financial condition: 
 the third party may be unable to make full and timely payments of interest and principal on the loan when due; 
 if the third-party buyer to whom we provide seller financing does not manage the property well, or the property otherwise fails to meet financial projections, performs poorly or declines in value, then the buyer may not have the funds or ability to raise new debt with which to make required payments of interest and principal to us; 
 if we loan funds to a joint venture, and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest or principal, or both, or there are disagreements with respect to the repayment of the loan or other matters, then we could have a resulting dispute with our partner(s), and such a dispute could harm our relationship(s) with our partner(s) and cause delays in developing or selling the property or the failure to properly manage the property; and 
 if we loan funds to a joint venture and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest and principal, or both, then we may exercise remedies available to us in the joint venture agreement that could allow us to increase our ownership interest or our control over major decisions, or both, which could result in an unconsolidated joint venture becoming consolidated with our financial statement; doing so could 
 30 

T able of Contents 

 require us to reallocate the purchase price among the various asset and liability components and this could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition. 
 We face risks associated with property acquisitions. 
 We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks: 
 even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs; 
 we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all; 
 acquired properties may fail to perform as expected; 
 the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates; 
 the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied; 
 acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; 
 we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and 
 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. Investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that BXP continues to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to REITs. If we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, BXP could fail to qualify as a REIT. In addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrower s default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments. There can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy. 
 We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP. This acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. 
 Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability. 
 We may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: 
 liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination; 
 claims by clients, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties; 
 liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and 
 31

 claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. 
 Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties. 
 We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: 
 we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private REITs, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and 
 even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price. 
 We may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility. 
 Properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. Properties that we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or that we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases. Furthermore, as a REIT, BXP may be subject to a 100 prohibited transactions tax on the gain from dispositions of property if BXP is deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met. The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable REIT subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. If we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Code applicable to REITs, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage. In some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. To dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which are intended to qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants). 
 Because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry. 
 The following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property: 
 our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners; 
 if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates; 
 our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and 
 our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including public health concerns, war and terrorism. 
 In addition, because our hotel property is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it is subject to the Cambridge market s fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.

 Failure to comply with Federal Government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the U.S. Government was one of our largest clients by square feet. We are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a Federal Government contractor. These laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors. Our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the Federal Government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the Federal Government. There can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business. 
 Changes in rent control or rent stabilization and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio s results of operations and residential property values. 
 Various state and local governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees, such as pet fees or application fees. Depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations, as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues, such future enactments could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio s results of operations and the value of our residential properties. 
 State and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants rights laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolio s results of operations and the value of our residential properties. If we are restricted from re-leasing apartment units due to the inability to evict delinquent residents, our results of operations and property values for our residential properties may be adversely affected. 
 We did not obtain new owner s title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during BXP s initial public offering. 
 We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of BXP s initial public offering in June 1997. Before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. We did not obtain new owner s title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. To the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. Nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. If there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of the initial public offering of BXP, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after the initial public offering of BXP, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. 
 Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. 
 Our property insurance program per occurrence limits are 1.0 billion for our portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism Terrorism Coverage ). We also carry 1.35 billion of property insurance in excess of the 1.0 billion of coverage in our property insurance program for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, consisting of 750 million of property and Terrorism Coverage in excess of our property insurance program and 600 million of Terrorism Coverage only in excess of the 1.75 billion of coverage. Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York 767 Fifth Avenue ), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are 1.625 billion, including Terrorism Coverage. We also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA ( NBCR Coverage ), which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is 1.0 billion. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible 
 33 

T able of Contents 

 and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is 200 million, the coinsurance is 20 and the deductible is 20 of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim. If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA. We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. We intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance. 
 We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes. Specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a 330 million per occurrence limit, and a 330 million annual aggregate limit, 30 million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 5 of the value of the affected property. In addition, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our Seattle region with a 110 million per occurrence limit, and a 110 million annual aggregate limit. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 2 of the value of the affected property. The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. We may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage. 
 IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and our NBCR Coverage. Insofar as we own IXP, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government. If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. In addition, BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of 20.0 million. 
 We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents, in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations. 
 Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties. 
 We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. As a result, some clients in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. In addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. As a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. See also Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

 We face risks associated with security breaches, incidents, and compromises through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. 
 We face risks associated with security breaches, incidents, and compromises, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, social engineering tactics, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach, incident, compromise, or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems and accounting for our business operations) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients. 
 Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures designed to manage the risk of a security breach, incident, compromise or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches, incident, compromise or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases, are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. 
 Like other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts at unauthorized access of our network, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees. To date, these events have not, individually or in the aggregate, materially affected our operations or business. However, a security breach, incident, compromise or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could: 
 disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our clients; 
 result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines; 
 result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding BXP s qualification as a REIT; 
 result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage and claims or threats by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; 
 result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our clients for the efficient use of their leased space; 
 require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; 
 subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements or subject us to litigation and regulatory investigations and related fines and penalties; 
 be uninsured or exceed policy limits, increase operating costs, including insurance expenses, or make future cyber risk coverage unavailable on commercially reasonable terms ; and 
 damage our reputation among our clients and investors generally. 
 Any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to Part I, Item 1C. Cybersecurity in this Form 10-K for more information.

 We face risks associated with our clients and contractual counterparties being designated Prohibited Persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
 Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury OFAC maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned Prohibited Persons ). OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons (the OFAC Requirements ). Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements. We have established a compliance program whereby clients and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. Our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements. If a client or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful. 
 The outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases could adversely impact or cause disruption to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and that of our clients. 
 Public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. The full extent to which any future pandemic or similar outbreak may impact our operations and those of our clients will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We have previously experienced adverse impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, and factors related to any future public health crises that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition include: 
 changes made by companies in response to a pandemic that could lead to a sustained shift away from collective in-person work environments or relocations away from the markets in which we operate, either of which could adversely affect the overall demand for workplaces in the regions in which we operate; 
 reduced economic activity and/or supply chain disruptions or delays in delivery of products, services or other materials necessary for our clients that impact our clients businesses, financial condition or liquidity may cause, one or more of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us, including their ability to make timely rental payments, in full or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations, including rent concessions, deferrals or abatements, or to declare bankruptcy. Any one or more of the foregoing could: 
 reduce our cash flows, 
 adversely impact our ability to finance, refinance or sell a property, 
 adversely impact our ability to continue paying distributions to our securityholders at current levels, or at all, and 
 result in additional legal and other costs to enforce our rights, collect rent and/or re-lease the space occupied by the distressed client; 
 the degree to which our clients businesses are negatively impacted could require us to write-off a client s accrued rent balance and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity; 
 new laws, governmental policies, and similar actions, including legal restrictions on prosecutions, could adversely impact public safety and thereby adversely affect (1) the desirability of clients to lease space in our properties or markets, and (2) businesses office re-population plans; 
 the impact of a pandemic could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charge is taken; 
 we may be unable to restructure or amend leases with certain of our clients on terms favorable to us or at all; 
 36

 the impact and validity of interpretations of lease provisions and applicable laws related to claims by clients regarding their obligations to pay rent as a result of a pandemic, and any adverse court rulings or decisions interpreting these provisions and laws, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity; 
 the impact of governmental and business travel limitations and restrictions could result in temporary or sustained periods of decreased demand for hotel stays at our hotel property; 
 the extent of labor shortages, disruptions in the supply chains, inflation impacting costs of materials, delays in permitting or inspections, and other factors could result in our failure to meet the development milestones set forth in any applicable lease agreement, which could provide the client the right to terminate its lease or entitle the client to monetary damages, delay the commencement or completion of construction and our anticipated lease-up plans for a development/redevelopment project or our overall development pipeline, including recognizing revenue for new leases, that may cause returns on investment to be less than projected, and/or increase the costs of construction of new or existing projects, any of which could adversely affect our investment returns, profitability and/or our future growth; and 
 the potential that business interruption, loss of rental income and/or other associated expenses related to our operations will not be covered in whole or in part by our insurance policies, which may increase unreimbursed liabilities. 
 We face risks associated with climate change and severe weather events, as well as the regulatory efforts intended to reduce the effects of climate change . 
 The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. For example, many of our properties are located along the East and West coasts, particularly those in the central business districts of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, rising sea-levels and/or drought. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or increased costs associated with infrastructure-related remediation projects. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by making property insurance unavailable or by increasing the cost of (i) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, (ii) real estate taxes or other assessments, (iii) energy and (iv) property maintenance. In addition, we face transition risks related to federal, state and local legislation and regulations that are being implemented, are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change or that require increased environmental disclosures and reporting. The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements, including GHG emissions regulations and policies, could negatively impact our financial results. 
 For additional discussion regarding our approach to climate resiliency and our continued commitment to transparent reporting of sustainability performance indicators, see Item 1. Business Business and Growth Strategies Sustainability and our annual Sustainability Impact Report available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading Commitment. 
 Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs. 
 Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at or migrating from our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs. 
 These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a 20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of 40 million. The presence or migration of hazardous or toxic 
 37 

T able of Contents 

 substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may give rise to third-party claims for bodily injury, property damage and/or response costs and may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. In addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination. Changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures. 
 Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials. For example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos: 
 properly manage and maintain the asbestos; 
 notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and 
 undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. 
 Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. 
 Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. Where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem. Even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that: 
 the environmental assessments and updates did not identify or properly address all potential environmental liabilities; 
 a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments; 
 new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and 
 future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us. 
 Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other adverse health effects. If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation, special cleaning measures and steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. Such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property s clients or require rehabilitation of the affected property. 
 Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs. 
 The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that certain buildings, including office buildings, residential buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If, under the Americans 
 38 

T able of Contents 

 with Disabilities Act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders. 
 Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. 
 Any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business. 
 We have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real estate-related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us. If we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local laws and government and permitting procedures. In addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. 
 Investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. 
 We may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest. 
 If we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk. We cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks. 
 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financing 
 A sustained increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all. 
 As of February 20, 2024, we had 2.1 billion outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at a variable rate, and we may incur more indebtedness in the future. All of our variable rate debt has all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term. Interest rates increased throughout 2023, and may remain elevated throughout 2024. As interest rates have increased, the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt have also increased, which, if sustained or continues to increase, could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. In 
 39 

T able of Contents 

 addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. 
 Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to modify or discontinue insurance coverage. Our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. In addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. Additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms. 
 We rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. If we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. In addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. 
 We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. Therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. In addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity. There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. These conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future. 
 We have had and may in the future have agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt. As of December 31, 2023, we had one tax protection agreement that could restrict our ability to repay or finance debt. 
 Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities. 
 As of February 20, 2024, our Consolidated Debt was approximately 15.4 billion (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt).

 Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two major rating agencies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these ratings. In December 2023 and January 2024, our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded, although both remain investment grade. In the event our senior debt is further downgraded from its current ratings, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of BXP s stock price, or BPLP s ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities. 
 We face risks associated with short-term liquid investments. 
 We may invest cash balances in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. From time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly): 
 direct obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury; 
 obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies; 
 taxable municipal securities; 
 obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts; 
 commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term U.S. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks; 
 repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations; 
 both registered and unregistered money market funds; and 
 other highly rated short-term securities. 
 Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. In addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

 Risks Related to Our Organization and Structure 
 Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP. 
 Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on BXP s stockholders. 
 Some holders of interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to BXP and its stockholders. Consequently, such holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. While BXP has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described below, any such decision would require the approval of BXP s Board of Directors. While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters, directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of BXP s stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness. 
 Agreement not to sell some properties. 
 We have had and may have in the future agreements with the contributors of properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP pursuant to which we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income to the contributors. In addition, we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. In general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered. 
 Also, BPLP has had and may have in the future agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. These agreements may hinder actions that BPLP may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because doing so would require BPLP to make payments to the prior owners if BPLP violates these agreements. 
 Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders. 
 Provisions in BXP s charter and bylaws, BXP s shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, as well as provisions of the Code and Delaware corporate law, may: 
 delay or prevent a change of control over BXP or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to BXP s stockholders; and 
 limit BXP s stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices. 
 Stock Ownership Limit 
 To facilitate maintenance of BXP s qualification as a REIT and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, BXP s charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6 of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of its common stock. We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit. BXP s Board of Directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize BXP s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, under BXP s charter, each of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15 of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of BXP s equity common stock. Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control. 
 BPLP s Partnership Agreement 
 BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of BPLP other than BXP receive, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as 
 42 

T able of Contents 

 holders of BXP common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of BXP common stock received in the transaction. If these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75 of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by BXP or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. In addition, BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that it will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which BXP receives the approval of its common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75 of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by BXP or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. Therefore, if BXP s common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before it can complete the transaction: 
 holders of partnership interests in BPLP, including BXP, must vote on the matter; 
 BXP must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as its stockholders voted on the transaction; and 
 the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved. 
 With respect to specified extraordinary transactions, BXP has agreed in BPLP s partnership agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such a transaction to avoid causing its limited partners to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such a transaction. 
 As a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and BXP may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though BXP stockholders approve of the transaction. 
 We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders. 
 Our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by BXP s Board of Directors. Accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies. 
 Risks Related to BXP s Status as a REIT 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause BXP to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends. 
 If BXP fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply. We believe that BXP is organized and qualified as a REIT and intends to operate in a manner that will allow BXP to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that BXP is qualified as such, or that it will remain qualified as such in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. 
 In addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, then BXP may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT then, unless certain relief provisions apply, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because: 
 BXP would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; 
 43 

T able of Contents 

 BXP also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for tax years ending before January 1, 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes; and 
 unless BXP is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, BXP could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified. 
 In addition, if BXP fails to qualify as a REIT and the relief provisions do not apply, it will no longer be required to pay dividends. As a result of all these factors, BXP s failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of BXP s common stock. If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT but is eligible for certain relief provisions, then it may retain its status as a REIT, but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial. 
 In order to maintain BXP s REIT status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. 
 In order to maintain BXP s REIT status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. To qualify as a REIT, BXP generally must distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income each year, excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments. In addition, BXP will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of ordinary income, 95 of capital gain net income and 100 of undistributed income from prior years. We may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Any inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain BXP s REIT status. 
 We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition. 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. BXP, its taxable REIT subsidiaries, and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation. 
 We face possible adverse state and local tax audits and changes in state and local tax laws. 
 Because BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders.

 General Risk Factors 
 Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of BXP s common stock. 
 As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of BXP s common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of BXP s common stock are the following: 
 the extent of investor interest in our securities; 
 the general reputation of REITs and the sentiment towards the office sector and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies; 
 our underlying asset value; 
 investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally; 
 national economic conditions; 
 changes in tax laws; 
 our financial performance; 
 changes in our credit ratings; 
 differences between the yields paid on other investments available in the market and BXP s dividend yield; and 
 general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates. 
 The market value of BXP s common stock is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, BXP s common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than BXP s net asset value per share of common stock. If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of BXP s common stock will diminish. 
 Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders. 
 The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions or repay indebtedness. Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity. 
 The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of BXP s stock. 
 In connection with and subsequent to BXP s initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of BXP or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. This common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. Future sales of BXP common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of its common stock. We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of BXP s common stock. 
 Our involvement in legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial monetary and other costs that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties in which such parties have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and/or added as an additional insured under certain insurance policies. An unfavorable resolution of any legal proceeding or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations. Regardless of its outcome, legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert 
 45 

T able of Contents 

 the attention of our management. With respect to any legal proceeding or other claim, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail, or achieve a favorable settlement or outcome, or that our insurance or the insurance and/or any contractual indemnities of our vendors, contractors, clients or other contractual parties will be enough to cover all of our defense costs or any resulting liabilities. 
 Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our clients. 
 Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for U.S. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Changes include, but are not limited to, changes in revenue recognition, lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of fair-value measures. 
 These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. Similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our clients reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our clients preferences regarding leasing real estate. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 None. 
 
 Item 1C. Cybersecurity. 
 Our information technology IT networks and related systems are essential to the efficient operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems and accounting for our business operations). In some cases, our clients operations depend on our building systems. The risk of a security breach, incident, compromise or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Like other businesses, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to attempts at unauthorized access of our network, mishandling or misuse, computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and intrusions and other events of varying degrees. To date, these events have not, individually or in the aggregate, materially affected our operations or business. In addition, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of the cybersecurity risks related to our Company. 
 Cybersecurity Risk Management Strategy 
 We have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program that is designed to identify, assess and manage risks from cybersecurity threats and was established by reference to the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The primary goal of our cybersecurity program is to prevent cybersecurity incidents to the extent feasible, while simultaneously increasing our system resilience in an effort to minimize the business impact should an incident occur. We aim to take an active approach to monitoring and evaluating our cybersecurity threat environment and risk profile as part of our cybersecurity program, which is administered by our information systems IS department, led by our Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer CTO and Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer CIO, together with our CTO, IS Leaders ). Our IS Leaders are primarily responsible for the direction and implementation of technology, applications and security at BXP. Our CTO has extensive technology and program management experience with approximately 40 years of technology experience, 26 years of which have been with BXP and a total of 30 years with publicly-traded REITs. In January 2024, our IS leadership expanded to include our CIO, who has 30 years of technology experience developed across multiple industries, including commercial real estate, in guiding organizations through strategic initiatives that span technology, cybersecurity, and digital transformations. 
 46 

T able of Contents 

 We maintain written information security policies and procedures, including a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan CIRP for incidents involving potential or actual compromises of information security. Our CIRP is overseen by the cyber executive response team, which is chaired by our Vice President, Risk Management and includes representatives from our IS and legal departments. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have implemented procedures to (i) mobilize third-party subject matter experts and (ii) notify executive leadership and the Audit Committee and/or the full Board of Directors, in each case, as appropriate. 
 As part of our overall cybersecurity program, we also conduct: 
 Regular assessments of our cybersecurity program . We assess our cybersecurity program against the NIST Cybersecurity Framework through annual internal assessments, and, every two years, we engage a third-party consultant to conduct an additive cyber assessment. These assessments review, among other things, our IT security measures and activities for alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. 
 Periodic penetration testing vulnerability assessments . On an annual basis, we engage a third-party consultant to conduct two penetration tests per year. We also conduct vulnerability assessments on a monthly basis. 
 Regular cybersecurity awareness trainings simulations . We conduct cybersecurity awareness training for employees and primary on-site providers during onboarding, and thereafter, multiple times per year, and we conduct regular phishing simulations in an effort to raise awareness of spoofed or manipulated electronic communications and other security threats, as well as annual tabletop simulations. 
 In addition, our internal audit function integrates the assessment and identification of cybersecurity-related risks into our annual overall enterprise risk assessment ERA ). The ERA process is designed to assess and identify the key risks that management believes could adversely impact our business operations or impede the achievement of our business objectives, which includes an assessment of our cybersecurity program and the cybersecurity-related risks that we face. To the extent the ERA identifies a heightened cybersecurity-related risk(s), we have implemented a process for the risk(s) to be presented to the Audit Committee and the full Board of Directors, as appropriate. 
 We utilize certain third-party service providers to perform select functions. These third-party service providers also face cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting any of our third-party service providers could also indirectly affect our operations, performance and results of operations. We have a data security committee, consisting of members from various BXP departments, including IS, legal and risk management, that meets periodically to assess, identify and manage cybersecurity risks related to certain third-party service providers and to protect our critical financial and sensitive business information, as well as personally identifiable information (collectively, Sensitive Information ). The data security committee has implemented processes for evaluating the risk profile of those service providers that handle or have access to Sensitive Information, which informs applicable contractual obligations with these service providers. This evaluation, which occurs prior to onboarding, is designed to consider the nature of the services to be provided, the level of sensitivity and quantity of the information that the service provider handles or has access to, and the identity of the service provider. 
 Cybersecurity Governance 
 Our Board of Directors is primarily responsible for risk oversight and discharges its responsibility directly or indirectly through its committees. In general, our risk management is designed to be facilitated through a top-down and bottom-up communication structure whereby the Board and/or its committees provide oversight and direction, and management is charged with the day-to-day management of risks, regular assessment of the risk environment and regular reporting to the Board, which may include management reports and reports from outside advisors and consultants engaged by the Board, a specific committee or management, as appropriate. This overall risk management and oversight framework includes risks related to cybersecurity threats. 
 Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee oversees senior management s risk management processes related to assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks in an effort to, among other things, help align our risk exposure with our strategic objectives. The Audit Committee meets no less frequently than annually with our IS department to discuss, among other things, recent trends in cyber risks, cybersecurity incidents, if any, and our cybersecurity defense strategy to protect against cyber-attacks and intrusions. These discussions with the Audit Committee are led by our IS Leaders and senior management. The Audit Committee provides regular updates to the full Board of Directors on matters under its purview, including risk management and cybersecurity matters.

 Item 2. Properties. 
 At December 31, 2023, we owned or had joint venture interests in 188 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 53.3 million net rentable square feet of primarily premier workplaces, including 10 properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 2.7 million net rentable square feet. Our properties consisted of (1) 167 office and life sciences properties (including seven properties under construction/redevelopment), (2) 14 retail properties (including two properties under construction/redevelopment), (3) six residential properties (including one property under construction) and (4) one hotel.

 Overview 
 BXP is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (REITs) (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2023) in the U.S. that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces. Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the U.S. - Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients. When making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the amount of any security deposit or letter of credit posted by the client, the costs of tenant improvements, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other clients expansion rights, and general economic factors. 
 Our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers, and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients that are diverse across market sectors. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining lease term based on square feet (1) for our in-place leases, including those signed by our unconsolidated joint 
 59 

T able of Contents 

 ventures but excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years, and (2) for our 20 largest clients was approximately 10.7 years. 
 To be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship. In this regard, we believe we have a competitive leasing advantage that results from: 
 our understanding of our client s short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets; 
 our track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner; 
 our reputation as a high-quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets; 
 our financial strength, including our ability to fund our share of lease obligations and maintain premier building standards; and 
 our relationships with local brokers. 
 Outlook 
 The U.S. economy continued to grow during the fourth quarter of 2023, with the Gross Domestic Product growing at a 3.3 annual rate in the fourth quarter. While the year also ended with continued low unemployment and cooling inflation, the economic statistics may not accurately reflect the market sentiment and operating environment facing many of our clients, as well as BXP, as we look ahead to 2024 and beyond. 
 In 2023, the U.S. office markets experienced overall negative leasing absorption, including in all of our coastal markets, as well as the major Sunbelt and Midwest markets. According to recent labor statistics, the U.S. added 333,000 jobs in December, however, only approximately 8 of those jobs were categorized as professional and business services, which are drivers of demand for premier workplace space. Despite the slowed pace of job reductions from this time last year, we continue to see employee layoff announcements across a wide variety of industries, particularly technology. As a result, although the U.S. economy may not enter a technical recession, we do not expect that a soft landing will stimulate an increase in office-using employment or in leasing absorption in 2024. 
 Remote work continues to be a factor restraining demand for office space, though we believe macroeconomic conditions are the primary driver of leasing activity and that our leasing, in particular, is driven by corporate earnings growth. The S P 500 s trailing 10-year average annual earnings growth rate from 2013-2022 was 8.4 , as compared to 2023 where, earnings growth is projected to be less than 1 . S P 500 companies are expected to increase earnings by over 9 in 2024. As overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients improves, it should lead to employment growth and demand for office space over time. However, we are not counting on a near-term market recovery to maintain our occupancy. Our leasing, construction and property management teams will lean on our operating prowess to gain new clients and market share as clients choose premier workplaces that are in sound financial condition for their office space. 
 The evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as: 
 labor market conditions shift, resulting in increasing employer demands for mandatory in-person workdays; 
 volatility in the capital markets has led companies to be more reticent in capital outlays, including capital required for leasing new space; 
 our capital costs have increased due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, and private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, is significantly more challenging to arrange; and 
 construction costs have increased and, although much of the cost for our active development pipeline is fixed, the cost of potential future construction activity continues to increase. 
 In light of the uncertain trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, we believe we continue to position BXP for success by increasing liquidity, managing our leverage, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and maintaining discipline in discretionary capital expenditures, while continuing to selectively invest (including through both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities. We remain focused on the following strategies: 
 60 

T able of Contents 

 continuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace segment and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. Premier workplaces, the preferred choice for our current and prospective clients, are gaining market share compared to general office space and continue to demonstrate the highest occupancy, net absorption levels and rental rates in the central business districts CBDs in markets where we operate; 
 leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations; 
 completing the construction and leasing of our development properties; 
 pursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as life sciences and residential development; 
 continuing to raise the bar in the quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, which have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by a slowdown in the capital markets and the limited availability of private market debt financing; 
 actively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and 
 prioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments. 
 The following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and recent business highlights. 
 Leasing Activity and Occupancy 
 The macroeconomic environment has resulted in softening demand in all of our markets. While property tours continue and lease negotiations move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. Potential clients touring space acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we signed more than 1.5 million square feet of leases with a weighted-average lease term of approximately 8.4 years, for a total of approximately 4.2 million square feet leased in 2023 with a weighted-average lease term of 8.2 years. This is the third consecutive quarter that leasing has increased, underscoring the demand for premier workplaces despite the challenging market. 
 The overall occupancy of our in-service premier workplace and retail properties was 88.4 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 40 basis points from September 30, 2023. We define occupancy as space with signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP. Including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP, our in-service premier workplace and retail properties were approximately 89.9 leased at December 31, 2023. 
 Investment Activity 
 We continually evaluate current and prospective markets for possible acquisitions of value-add assets that require lease-up or repositioning, and acquisitions that are otherwise consistent with our long-term strategy of owning, managing, developing, and improving premier workplaces in each of our chosen markets. We expect to see more opportunities to make investments in this environment, and we remain committed to developing and acquiring assets to enhance our long-term growth and to meet current and future client demand for premier workplaces, life sciences, and residential development. 
 Consistent with this strategy, we purchased our partners interests in three assets from two different joint venture partners, one of which closed in early January 2024. 
 We completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner s 45 ownership interest in Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California. The acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of 38.0 million, and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 20 million, as well as the partner s share of the outstanding 300.0 million mortgage debt. Subsequent to closing, we extended an approximately 467,000 square foot lease with anchor client, Snap Inc. through 2036. Santa Monica Business Park is a 47-acre office park consisting of 21 buildings and totaling approximately 1.2 million net rentable square feet. Approximately 70 of the square footage is subject to a ground lease having a remaining term of approximately 75 years, inclusive of renewal options 
 61

 that are subject to certain conditions. Under the ground lease, we have a purchase option at fair market value in 2028 (See Notes 3, 4, and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 We completed the acquisition of one of our joint venture partner s approximate 29 ownership interest in 360 Park Avenue South located in New York City, New York for a purchase price of 1. We now own approximately 71 of the joint venture. We also assumed the partner s share of the joint venture s cash and working capital aggregating approximately 25.4 million, as well as the partner s share of the outstanding 220.0 million mortgage debt. 360 Park Avenue South is a 20-story, approximately 450,000 square foot premier workplace that is currently under redevelopment (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 On January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner s 50 economic ownership interest in 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC for a purchase price of 10.0 million. We also assumed the partner s share of the outstanding approximately 207.1 million mortgage debt, which bears interest at 3.61 per annum and matures on January 5, 2025. On January 11, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan to provide for two loan extension options totaling five years of additional term, each subject to certain conditions. The first loan extension option is four years at a fixed interest rate of 5.0 per annum. Also, we extended an approximately 200,000 square foot lease with anchor client, Finnegan Henderson Farabow Garrett Dunner, L.L.P. through 2042. 901 New York Avenue is a premier workplace consisting of approximately 548,000 net rentable square feet. 
 These transactions were sparked, in part, by lease extensions at two of the properties and further motivated by our partners electing to reduce their exposure to and investment in the office sector. We believe we purchased their interests on attractive terms. 
 Also in the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into agreements to sell a 45 interest in each of 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street, two life sciences development projects located in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to an institutional investor at a gross valuation of approximately 1.66 billion or 2,050 per square foot. The properties total approximately 802,000 square feet and each is 100 pre-leased. We completed the sale of a 45 interest in 300 Binney Street upon entry into the agreement in November 2023. We will provide development, property management, and leasing services for the ventures. The institutional investor funded approximately 212.9 million at closing for its 45 investment in 300 Binney Street and, upon closing of its 45 investment in 290 Binney Street, their investment will reduce our estimated future development spend over time by approximately 533.5 million (See Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 As of December 31, 2023, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of 10 properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 2.7 million net rentable square feet. Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately 2.4 billion, of which approximately 1.3 billion remains to be invested. The commercial space in the pipeline, which excludes Skymark Reston Next Residential, was 53 pre-leased as of February 20, 2024. 
 As we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market, as evidenced by the partial interest sale of 300 Binney Street during the fourth quarter of 2023 and anticipated partial interest sale of 290 Binney Street. However, the asset sale market for all real estate asset classes has slowed dramatically with the increase in interest rates and transaction volume for office assets continues to be minimal in the U.S. 
 A brief overview of each of our markets follows.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following: 
 Purchase price allocations, 
 Impairment and 
 Impairment related to unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Each of the above critical accounting estimates is described in more detail below. 
 Real Estate 
 Purchase Price Allocations 
 We assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the clients, the clients credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. 
 65 

T able of Contents 

 We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Acquired above- and below-market lease values have been reflected within Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each client s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner s 45 interest in the joint venture entity that owns Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California, for a gross purchase price of approximately 38.0 million. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, and the purchase price was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Impairment 
 Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Because cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset may be impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate a shorter hold period, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. 
 Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 Impairment 
 Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, debt interest rates and availability, discount rates and capitalization rates that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the net carrying amounts of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately 1.3 billion, which includes investments with deficit balances aggregating approximately 39.9 million included within Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our investments in Platform 16, 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza of approximately 155.2 million, 54.0 million, 33.4 million and 29.9 million, respectively (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

 At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 188 and 194 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed In-Service, In or Held for Development or Redevelopment or Sold Portfolios. 
 In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of NOI between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in or held for development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.

 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, losses from interest rate contracts, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment, gains (losses) from investments in securities, other income - assignment fee, interest and other income (loss), gain on sales-type lease, gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently. 
 We believe that in order to understand our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of BPLP OP Units ). This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022 
 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 125 properties totaling approximately 38.3 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2022 and owned and in service through December 31, 2023. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment after January 1, 2022 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2023. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold.

 Same Property Portfolio 
 Lease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income) 
 Lease revenue (excluding termination income) from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately 39.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately 1.88, contributing approximately 70.3 million, partially offset by average occupancy decreasing from 91.2 to 90.2 , resulting in a decrease of approximately 31.2 million. 
 Termination Income 
 Termination income decreased by approximately 4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. 
 Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to 24 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately 3.0 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in San Francisco. 
 Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to 27 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately 6.7 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in New York City. In addition, we received a distribution from our unsecured credit claim against Lehman Brothers, Inc. of approximately 0.6 million. 
 Parking and Other Revenue 
 Parking and other revenue increased by approximately 16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. Parking and other revenue increased by approximately 7.3 million and 9.0 million, respectively. The increase in parking revenue was primarily due to an increase in transient and monthly parking. The increase in other revenue was primarily related to the View Boston observatory, which was completed and placed in-service on June 1, 2023. 
 Real Estate Operating Expenses 
 Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately 62.8 million, or 6.1 , for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, due primarily to increases in real estate taxes of approximately 19.2 million, or 3.8 , and other real estate operating expenses of approximately 33.4 million, or 5.9 . The increase in real estate taxes was primarily in New York City. In addition, there was approximately 10.2 million related to the marketing and operating expenses associated with the View Boston observatory which was completed and placed in-service on June 1, 2023. 
 Properties Acquired Portfolio 
 The table below lists the properties acquired between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023. Rental revenue and real estate operating expenses increased by approximately 65.5 million and 8.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, as detailed below.

 (1) Average Monthly Rental Rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. 
 (2) Average Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage. 
 (3) Average Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property s total possible gross revenue. Market Rents used by us in calculating Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property s units and publicly available market data. Actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from Market Rents used by us. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. 
 Hotel Net Operating Income 
 The Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel had net operating income of approximately 15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of approximately 3.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. As demand for travel has returned, the Boston Marriott Cambridge has seen an increase in occupancy and room rates, which has led to increased net operating income.

 Other Operating Revenue and Expense Items 
 Development and Management Services Revenue 
 Development and management services revenue increased by approximately 12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. Development services revenue and management services revenue increased by approximately 5.0 million and 7.8 million, respectively. The increase in development services revenue was primarily related to an increase in development fees earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Washington, DC region and an increase in fees associated with tenant improvement projects earned from a third-party owned building and a consolidated joint venture in the New York region. The increase in management services revenue was primarily related to an increase in property management fees earned from a third-party owned building in the Washington, DC region and an unconsolidated joint venture in the New York region. The increase in management services revenue was also related to an increase in asset management fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the Los Angeles region and leasing commission fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the New York region. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense increased by approximately 23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in compensation expense and other general and administrative expenses of approximately 21.2 million and 2.6 million, respectively. The increase in compensation expense related to (1) an approximately 12.1 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and (2) an approximately 9.1 million increase in other compensation expenses, primarily due to age-based vesting and annual increases in employee compensation. The increase in other general and administrative expenses primarily related to an increase in professional fees.

 Transaction Costs 
 Transaction costs increased by approximately 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. In general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded approximately 0.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage. 
 Direct Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs From Management Services Contracts and Payroll and Related Costs From Management Service Contracts 
 We have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. We anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other. 
 Other Income and Expense Items 
 Loss from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 For the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately 179.7 million primarily due to an approximately 272.6 million non-cash impairment charge (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). This increase was partially offset by (1) an approximately 34.3 million net gain related to the disposition of our interest in Metropolitan Square, (2) an approximately 29.9 million gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of our joint venture partner s interest in our Santa Monica Business Park joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2023 (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (3) an approximately 50.7 million non-cash impairment charge at our Dock 72 joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Gains on Sales of Real Estate 
 Gains on sales of real estate may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. For additional information, see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Gain on Sales-Type Lease 
 In connection with a ground lease amendment, executed on December 19, 2022 with a third-party hotel developer, we recorded a sales-type lease receivable of approximately 13.0 million, which includes an unguaranteed residual asset of approximately 17,000. The sales-type lease receivable was measured as the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments, including the unguaranteed residual value of the asset at the end of the lease, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. In addition, we recorded a gain on sales-type lease of approximately 10.1 million associated with the derecognition of the asset. 
 Interest and Other Income (Loss) 
 Interest and other income (loss) increased by approximately 58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, due primarily to an increase of approximately 58.6 million in interest income due to increased interest earned on our deposits partially offset by an increase in our allowance for current expected credit losses of approximately 0.6 million. 
 Other Income - Assignment Fee 
 On April 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 11251 Roger Bacon Drive in Reston, Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5.6 million. On April 7, 2022, we executed an agreement to assign the right to acquire 11251 Roger Bacon Drive to a third party for an assignment fee of approximately 6.9 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately 6.6 million. 11251 Roger Bacon Drive is an approximately 65,000 square foot office building situated on approximately 2.6 acres. 
 Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities 
 Gains (losses) from investments in securities for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for BXP s officers and former non-employee directors. Under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer s current income or the non-employee director s compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. In order to 
 79 

T able of Contents 

 reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to BXP s officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately 5.6 million and (6.5) million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately 5.6 million and (6.5) million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of BXP participating in the plans. 
 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Non-Real Estate Investment 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we began investing in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally focused investment funds. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized an unrealized gain (loss) of approximately 0.2 million and (0.2) million, respectively, due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments. 
 Losses from Interest Rate Contracts 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, we entered into two agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a 600.0 million interest rate cap. We did not elect hedge accounting, and as such, any change in market value will be recognized at the end of the period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized approximately 79,000 of loss from entering into these agreements.

 Interest expense increased by approximately 142.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022, as detailed below.

 mortgage loan and fair value debt adjustment for Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. As portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. Interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately 42.6 million and 52.1 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. The decrease in capitalized interest is primarily attributable to a development project that had a finance lease and is now placed in service. 
 On February 1, 2024, BPLP completed the repayment of 700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800 senior notes due February 1, 2024. The repayment was completed with available cash and the 600 million proceeds from the mortgage loan entered into on October 26, 2023 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The repayment price was approximately 713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately 13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid. 
 At December 31 , 2023, our variable rate debt consisted of BPLP s 1.815 billion revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility under its 1.5 billion unsecured credit facility (the 2021 Credit Facility ), 1.2 billion unsecured term loan drawn by BPLP in January 2023 (the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan ), 900 million collateralized by Santa Monica Business Park and our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Kendall Center Green Garage properties. As of December 31, 2023, the Revolving Facility did not have a balance outstanding. The other variable rate debt has all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term.

 Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership 
 For BXP, noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately 74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to a decrease in allocable income, which was primarily the result of recognizing a non-cash impairment charge related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures during 2023 and a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2022. Due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on BPLP s financial statements.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: 
 fund normal recurring expenses; 
 meet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including the 1.2 billion 2023 Unsecured Term Loan maturing May 16, 2024 (unless we exercise the one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions) and 850 million of 3.200 unsecured senior notes due January 15, 2025; 
 fund development and redevelopment costs; 
 fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; 
 fund possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests; and 
 make the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
 We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: 
 cash flow from operations; 
 distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; 
 cash and cash equivalent balances; 
 borrowings under BPLP s Revolving Facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans; 
 long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); 
 sales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate; 
 private equity sources, including institutional investors; and 
 issuances of BXP equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in BPLP. 
 We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. We expect to fund our current development/redevelopment properties primarily with our available cash balances, funding from institutional private equity partners, construction loans, unsecured term loans, proceeds from asset sales and BPLP s Revolving Facility. We use BPLP s Revolving Facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. Although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by BPLP, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project s size and duration, whether the project is owned by a joint venture, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

 Lease revenue (which includes reimbursement of operating expenses from clients, if any), other income from operations, available cash balances, proceeds from mortgage financings and offerings of unsecured indebtedness, draws on BPLP s Revolving Facility, and funding from institutional private equity partners are the principal sources of capital that we use to fund operating expenses, debt service, development and redevelopment activities, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, interest earned on cash deposits and, from time to time, the sale of assets. We believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. 
 We expect our primary uses of capital over the next twelve months will be to fund our current and committed development and redevelopment projects, repay debt maturities (as discussed below), make interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, and satisfy our REIT distribution requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 10 properties under development or redevelopment. Our share of the estimated total investment for these projects is approximately 2.4 billion, of which approximately 1.3 billion remains to be funded primarily with equity through 2027. During 2023, we completed the development/redevelopment of: 
 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, an approximately 476,000 net rentable square foot premier workplace located in Washington, DC, for an estimated total investment of 394.9 million. Including leases with future commencement dates, the property was 95 leased as of December 31, 2023. 
 View Boston observatory, a panoramic three-floor observatory at the top of 800 Boylston Street - The Prudential Tower in Boston, Massachusetts, for an estimated total investment of 182.3 million. 
 140 Kendrick Street - Building A, a premier workplace redevelopment project with approximately 104,000 net rentable square feet located in Needham, Massachusetts, for an estimated total investment of 21.9 million. The property is the first net-zero, carbon-neutral office repositioning of its scale in Massachusetts. The property is 100 leased as of December 31, 2023. 
 751 Gateway, a laboratory/life sciences property with approximately 231,000 net rentable square feet in South San Francisco, California, for an estimated total investment of 127.6 million. We own this property through a joint venture entity in which we own a 49 interest. The property is 100 leased as of December 31, 2023. 
 Since September 30, 2023, we further strengthened our balance sheet through sourcing additional liquidity. Notable transactions include: 
 On November 13, 2023, we entered into agreements to sell a 45 interest in each of 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street, two life science development projects located in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to an institutional investor at a gross valuation of approximately 1.66 billion or 2,050 per square foot. The properties total approximately 802,000 net rentable square feet, and each is 100 pre-leased. We will provide development, property management, and leasing services for the joint ventures. The institutional investor funded approximately 212.9 million at closing for its 45 investment in 300 Binney Street (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and, upon closing of its 45 investment in 290 Binney Street, the institutional investor s investment will reduce BXP s estimated future development spend over time by approximately 533.5 million. 
 On October 26, 2023, we closed on a 600 million mortgage loan collateralized by our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage) properties located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The mortgage loan, totaling 600 million, requires interest-only payments at Daily Compounded SOFR plus 2.25 per annum until maturity on October 26, 2028. On December 7, 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix Daily Compounded SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 3.79 for an all-in interest rate of 6.04 for this mortgage loan.

 On February 1, 2024, we repaid at maturity our 3.800 unsecured senior notes at par utilizing available cash and the proceeds from the aforementioned 600 million mortgage loan. The repayment price was approximately 713.3 million, which included the stated principal of 700 million plus approximately 13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the repayment date. 
 Our consolidated debt maturities through January 31, 2025 include the 1.2 billion 2023 Unsecured Term Loan that matures on May 16, 2024 (unless we exercise the one-year extension option, subject to certain conditions) and 850 million aggregate principal amount of BPLP s 3.200 unsecured senior notes due January 15, 2025. In our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, we have approximately 343.2 million (our share) of debt maturing in 2024. We expect to fund the foregoing debt maturities using available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on BPLP s Revolving Facility, and/or through refinancings using secured debt or unsecured debt, or both. We expect our net interest expense will increase in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher interest rates on outstanding debt and debt that we refinance, and lower interest income as we use cash balances to repay debt and fund our development pipeline. 
 As of February 20, 2024, we had available cash of approximately 533.1 million (of which approximately 104.0 million is attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners). Our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors, and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately 1.8 billion available under BPLP s Revolving Facility and our available cash, as of February 20, 2024, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital needs on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced or extended), satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities. 
 We may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness. Depending on interest rates, the overall conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets, and our leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources. Doing so may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, which would increase our net interest expense. 
 On May 17, 2023, BXP renewed its ATM stock offering program through which it may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of 600.0 million of its common stock through sales agents over a three-year period. Under the ATM stock offering program, BXP may also engage in forward sale transactions with affiliates of certain sales agents for the sale of its common stock on a forward basis. BXP intends to use the net proceeds from any offering for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. We have not sold any shares under this ATM stock offering program. 
 Inflation 
 We are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our client leases that protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps and resets to market, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per-square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per-square-foot allowance. However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the rent may not increase frequently enough to fully cover inflation. 
 REIT Tax Distribution Considerations 
 Dividend 
 BXP as a REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that BXP currently distribute at least 90 of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). Our policy is for BXP to distribute at least 100 of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. Common and LTIP unitholders (other than unearned MYLTIP units) of limited partnership interest in BPLP receive the same distribution per unit that is paid per share of BXP common stock. 
 BXP s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate BXP s dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by BXP s Board of Directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount. 
 86 

T able of Contents 

 Sales 
 To the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, BXP would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of BXP s common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that BXP would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for BXP to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 
 From time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable REIT regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ). Such a sale by a TRS would be subject to federal and local taxes. 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately 1.6 billion and 736.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing an increase of approximately 875.8 million. The following table sets forth changes in cash flows: 
 Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,301,520 1,282,399 19,121 Net cash used in investing activities (1,193,681) (1,602,802) 409,121 Net cash provided by financing activities 767,916 556,057 211,859 
 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. The weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.8 years as of December 31, 2023, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 88 to 92 . Generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings. 
 Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain our market position. Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is detailed below:

 Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. We present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (A) our consolidated debt by (B) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. Consolidated market capitalization is the sum of: 
 (1) our consolidated debt; plus 
 (2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of BXP common stock on December 29, 2023, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of: 
 (i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of BXP, 
 (ii) the number of outstanding OP Units in BPLP (excluding OP Units held by BXP), 
 (iii) the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and 
 (iv) the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of 2012 OPP Units, and 2013 - 2020 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units. 
 The calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. Because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2021 - 2023 MYLTIP Units are not included in this calculation as of December 31, 2023. 
 We also present BXP s Share of Market Capitalization and BXP s Share of Debt/BXP s Share of Market Capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that BXP s Share of Debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. BXP s Share of Debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials). Management believes that BXP s Share of Debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. We have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures. We caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating BXP s Share of Debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. For example, in addition to partners interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters. Moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case GAAP requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. In other cases, GAAP requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. As a result, management believes that the presentation of BXP s Share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. Investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of BXP and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like BXP, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

 (3) At December 31, 2023, the 1.2 billion 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and two of our mortgage loans aggregating approximately 900.0 million bore interest at variable rates. We entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fixed the variability of these loans for all or a portion of the applicable debt term and as such, they are reflected in our Fixed rate statistics (see Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Unsecured Credit Facility 
 The 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to 1.815 billion, as described below, through the Revolving Facility, subject to customary conditions. The 2021 Credit Facility matures on June 15, 2026 and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component. Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP may increase the total commitment by up to 500.0 million by increasing the amount of the Revolving Facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the Accordion ). On September 28, 2023, BPLP exercised a portion of the Accordion with three new lenders to the 2021 Credit Facility (the New Lenders ). Each of the New Lenders entered into a lender agreement with BPLP to provide an aggregate 
 93

 of 315.0 million in additional revolving credit commitments, which increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from 1.5 billion to 1.815 billion. All other terms of the 2021 Credit Facility remain unchanged. 
 On June 1, 2023, BPLP amended its 2021 Credit Facility to replace the LIBOR-based daily floating rate option with a SOFR-based daily floating rate option and to add options for SOFR-based term floating rates and rates for alternative currency loans. In addition, the amendment added a SOFR credit spread adjustment of 0.10 . Other than the foregoing, the material terms of the 2021 Credit Facility remain unchanged. 
 At December 31, 2023, based on BPLP s then credit rating, (1) the applicable Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, alternative currency daily rate, and alternative currency term rate margins were 0.775 , (2) the alternate base rate margin was zero basis points and (3) the facility fee was 0.15 per annum. Based on BPLP s February 20, 2024 credit rating, (1) the applicable Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, alternative currency daily rate, and alternative currency term rate margins are 0.850 , (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.20 per annum. 
 At December 31, 2023 and February 20, 2024, BPLP had no borrowings under its Revolving Facility and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 6.7 million, with the ability to borrow approximately 1.8 billion. 
 Unsecured Term Loan 
 On January 4, 2023, BPLP entered into the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, which provided for a single borrowing of up to 1.2 billion. Under the credit agreement, BPLP may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan matures on May 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions. Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw 1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, a portion of which was used to repay in full the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan, which was scheduled to mature on May 16, 2023. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the 2022 Unsecured Term Loan. 
 At BPLP s option, loans under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5 , (b) the administrative agent s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.00 , and (d) 1.00 , in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating. 
 On May 2, 2023, BPLP executed interest rate swaps in notional amounts aggregating 1.2 billion. These interest rate swaps were entered into to fix Term SOFR, at a weighted-average rate of 4.6420 for the period commencing on May 4, 2023 and ending on May 16, 2024 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 At December 31, 2023, the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bore interest at a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.85 per annum based on BPLP s credit rating at December 31, 2023. Based on BPLP s February 20, 2024 credit rating, the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR plus 0.95 per annum. At December 31, 2023 and February 20, 2024, BPLP had 1.2 billion outstanding under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan. 
 Unsecured Senior Notes 
 For a description of BPLP s outstanding unsecured senior notes as of December 31, 2023, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On May 15, 2023, BPLP completed a public offering of 750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.500 unsecured senior notes due 2034. The notes were priced at 99.697 of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 6.619 per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on January 15, 2034, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately 741.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses. 
 On September 1, 2023, BPLP completed the repayment of 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.125 senior notes due September 1, 2023. The repayment price was approximately 507.8 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately 7.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the

 repayment date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid. 
 On February 1, 2024, BPLP completed the repayment of 700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800 senior notes due February 1, 2024. The repayment was completed with available cash and the 600 million proceeds from the mortgage loan entered into on October 26, 2023 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The repayment price was approximately 713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately 13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid. 
 The indenture relating to the unsecured senior notes contains certain financial restrictions and requirements, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60 , (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50 , (3) an interest coverage ratio of greater than 1.50, and (4) an unencumbered asset value of not less than 150 of unsecured debt. At December 31, 2023, BPLP was in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. 
 Mortgage Notes Payable 
 On October 26, 2023, we closed on a mortgage loan collateralized by our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage) properties located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The mortgage loan has a principal amount of 600.0 million, bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Compounded SOFR plus 2.25 per annum and matures on October 26, 2028. On December 7, 2023, BPLP entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating 600.0 million. These interest rate swap contracts were entered into to reduce the exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the interest rate associated with the mortgage. These interest rate swaps were entered into to fix Daily Compounded SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.7925 for the period commencing on December 15, 2023 and ending on October 26, 2028 (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the term of the loan, with the entire principal amount due at maturity. 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street and 90 Broadway are three premier workplaces that aggregate approximately 898,000 net rentable square feet. 
 On December 14, 2023, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner s 45 interest in the joint venture entity that owns Santa Monica Business Park located in Santa Monica, California (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. The mortgage loan has a principal amount of 300.0 million, bears interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 1.38 per annum and matures on July 19, 2025. The borrower under the loan entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating 300.0 million to fix SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.679 per annum for the period ending on April 1, 2025 (See Notes 3, 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These interest rate swap contracts were entered into to reduce the exposure to the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in the interest rate associated with the mortgage loan. The loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the term of the loan, with the entire principal due at maturity. Upon consolidation, the mortgage loan was recorded at a fair value of approximately 295.5 million using a weighted-average effective interest rate of approximately SOFR plus 2.50 per annum.

 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 2.1 billion of interest rate swaps outstanding, where hedge accounting was elected, with a fair value of approximately 2.0 million. For a description of these interest rate swaps, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as refer to the discussion above under Mortgage Notes Payable and Unsecured Term Loan . 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, we entered into two agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a 600.0 million interest rate cap. We did not elect hedge accounting and as such any change in market value will be recognized at the end of the period in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized approximately 79,000 of loss from entering into these agreements (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt 
 We have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 20 to approximately 71 . Fifteen of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. As a result, we account for them using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately 3.4 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately 1.4 billion). The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2023. In addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) as well as the completion of development projects on certain of the loans.

 (15) We provided 80.0 million of mortgage financing to the joint venture. The loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR plus 3.61 per annum. The loan has been reflected as Related Party Note Receivable, Net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the loan has approximately 28.0 million of accrued interest due at the maturity date. On February 6, 2024, the maturity date for the loan was extended to May 9, 2024. 
 (16) The construction financing has a borrowing capacity of 140.0 million. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to SOFR plus 2.00 per annum. 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. As of December 31, 2023, all of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures and after taking into account hedging agreements, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.

 Including the effects of interest rate swaps, at December 31, 2023, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding Consolidated Debt was 3.96 per annum. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 2.1 billion of consolidated variable rate debt outstanding, including 1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and 900.0 million of secured debt, all of which were subject to interest rate swaps (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to interest rate contracts in place as of December 31, 2023 and their respective fair values). If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately 21.0 million, on an annualized basis for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The information above does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt. 
 
 Funds from Operations 
 Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, for each of BXP and BPLP by adjusting net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, including a change in control, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and helps make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales or a change in control of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. 
 Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, one of the most predominant of which is a change in interest rates. Unless we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivatives to fix the interest rate, increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our Revolving Facility, 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, certain mortgage loans and other debt that bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our fixed rate debt matures and needs to be refinanced. 
 As of December 31, 2023, approximately 13.8 billion of our indebtedness bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is not affected by changes in the market interest rates. The remaining 2.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness bore interest at variable rates, including 1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and 900.0 million of secured debt. However, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating 2.1 billion, thus fixing the interest rates for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to interest rate contracts in place as of December 31, 2023 and their respective fair values). Therefore, as of December 31, 2023, we have no outstanding variable rate debt that has not been fixed through an interest rate swap. 
 The following table presents our aggregate debt obligations carrying value, estimated fair value and where applicable, the corresponding weighted-average GAAP interest rates sorted by maturity date as of December 31, 2023. 
 The table below does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, including interest rate swaps, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt.

 At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average stated interest rates on the fixed rate debt stated above was 3.69 per annum. At December 31, 2023, our outstanding variable rate debt totaled 2.1 billion, all of which was subject to interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average stated interest rate on our variable rate debt, including the effect of the interest rate swaps, was 5.79 per annum. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately 21.0 million, on an annualized basis for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Our use of derivative instruments also involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract. We believe that there is a low likelihood that these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations and we minimize our exposure by limiting counterparties to major banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines. There can be no assurance that we will adequately protect against the foregoing risks. 
 The fair value amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions, we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Properties, Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 114 

T able of Contents 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Assessment of Impairment Indicators of Long-Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 As described in Notes 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s total real estate balance was 20,593.5 million and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was 1,337.4 million as of December 31, 2023. During 2023, the Company recognized a 272.6 million other than temporary impairment related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. Management reviews its unconsolidated joint ventures for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. Management will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value of unconsolidated joint ventures is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, market interest rates and availability, discount rates, and capitalization rates. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of impairment indicators for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management (a) in identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) when developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management's identification of the indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) management s assumptions related to future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, market interest rates, discount rates and capitalization rates (collectively referred to as the significant fair value assumptions ), and (iii) the audit effort related to management s development of the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to (i) the identification of the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (ii) developing the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment. For the identification of the indicators of impairment, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the models, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the 
 115 

T able of Contents 

 models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management s indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Evaluating the operating performance and anticipated hold periods involved considering the current and past performance of the long-lived assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the indicators were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating performance of each investment and market conditions involved considering changes in the performance of the investments and market conditions and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. For the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary decline, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture relating to the other-than-temporary impairment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions used by management by considering industry knowledge and data, historical company data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions. 
 Purchase Price Allocation for Long-Lived Asset Property Acquisitions 
 As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired its joint venture partner s interest in a property for a purchase price of 38 million. Management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings and improvements, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing costs and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. Management assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount, and/or capitalization rates, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s significant assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the purchase price allocation for the long-lived asset property acquisition, including controls over the assumptions related to discount rate and capitalization rate used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements and leasing documents for the acquisition, (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow method, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the method, and, (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, related to the discount rate and capitalization rate by considering industry knowledge and data as well as historical company data and experience. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the discount rate and capitalization rate assumptions.

Management s Report on Internal Control over 
 Financial Reporting 
 Management of Boston Properties, Inc., the sole general partner of Boston Properties Limited Partnership, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Boston Properties, Inc. to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As of the end of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s 2023 fiscal year, management conducted assessments of the effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on these assessments, management has determined that Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 was effective. 
 Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Boston Properties, Inc.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 The effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report appearing on page 127 , which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Boston Properties Limited Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Partners of Boston Properties Limited Partnership 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Properties Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries (the Partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of capital and noncontrolling interests and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Partnership maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Partnership s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements and on the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
 127 

T able of Contents 

 assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Assessment of Impairment Indicators of Long-Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 As described in Notes 2, 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Partnership s total real estate balance was 20,350.6 million and its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was 1,337.4 million as of December 31, 2023. During 2023, the Partnership recognized a 272.6 million other than temporary impairment related to certain investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Management reviews its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment following the end of each quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation of long-lived assets is dependent on a number of factors, including when there is an event or adverse change in the operating performance of the long-lived asset or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or hold period. Management reviews its unconsolidated joint ventures for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis and records impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying amounts has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. This evaluation of the investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. Management will record an impairment charge if it determines that a decline in the fair value below the carrying amount of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary. The fair value of unconsolidated joint ventures is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which is subjective and considers assumptions regarding future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, market interest rates and availability, discount rates, and capitalization rates. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of impairment indicators for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management (a) in identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) when developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management's identification of the indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (b) management s assumptions related to future occupancy, future rental rates, future capital requirements, market interest rates, discount rates and capitalization rates (collectively referred to as the significant fair value assumptions ), and (iii) the audit effort related to management s development of the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture with an other-than-temporary impairment involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to (i) the identification of the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and (ii) developing the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary impairment. For the identification of the indicators of impairment, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for identifying the indicators of impairment for long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, (ii) evaluating the 
 128 

T able of Contents 

 reasonableness of the models, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the models, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management s indicators of impairment related to the operating performance and anticipated hold periods for long-lived assets and the performance of each investment and market conditions for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Evaluating the operating performance and anticipated hold periods involved considering the current and past performance of the long-lived assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the indicators were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating performance of each investment and market conditions involved considering changes in the performance of the investments and market conditions and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. For the fair value estimate of the unconsolidated investment in joint venture with an other- than- temporary decline, these procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in unconsolidated joint venture relating to the other-than-temporary impairment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions used by management by considering industry knowledge and data, historical Partnership data, and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the significant fair value assumptions. 
 Purchase Price Allocation for Long-Lived Asset Property Acquisitions 
 As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Partnership acquired its joint venture partner s interest in a property for a purchase price of 38 million. Management assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets (including land, buildings and improvements, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, leasing costs and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including ground leases)) and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. Management assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount, and/or capitalization rates, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the purchase price allocation for long-lived asset property acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management s significant assumptions related to discount rates and capitalization rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the purchase price allocation for the long-lived asset property acquisition, including controls over the assumptions related to discount rate and capitalization rate used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements and leasing documents for the acquisition, (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and the corresponding purchase price allocation, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of management s discounted cash flow method, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the method, and, (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, related to the discount rate and capitalization rate by considering industry knowledge and data as well as historical company data and experience. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness o f the discounted cash flow model and reasonableness of the discount rate and capitalization rate assumptions.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 at December 31, 2022) general and limited partnership interest in BPLP. Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the Company refers to BXP and its subsidiaries, including BPLP and its consolidated subsidiaries. Partnership interests in BPLP include: 
 common units of partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units and 
 long term incentive units of partnership interest (also referred to as LTIP Units 
 Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by BXP. A holder of an OP Unit may present the OP Unit to BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, BPLP is obligated to redeem the OP Unit for cash equal to the value of a share of common stock of BXP Common Stock ). In lieu of such cash redemption, BXP may elect to acquire the OP Unit for share of Common Stock. Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that BXP owns, share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. 
 The Company uses LTIP Units as a form of time-based, restricted equity compensation and as a form of performance-based equity compensation for employees, and has previously granted LTIP Units in the form of (1) 2012 outperformance plan awards 2012 OPP Units and (2) 2013 - 2023 multi-year, long-term incentive program awards (also referred to as MYLTIP Units ), each of which, upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based and time-based vesting conditions, is convertible into one OP Unit. The three -year measurement periods for the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2020 MYLTIP Units have ended and BXP s total stockholder return TSR was sufficient for employees to earn and therefore become eligible to vest in a portion of the awards.

 million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the lease/rental revenue recorded exceeded amounts billed. Accrued rental income, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents cumulative lease/rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. 
 The Company must estimate the collectability of its accrued rent and accounts receivable balances related to lease revenue. When evaluating the collectability of tenants accrued rent and accounts receivable balances, management considers tenants creditworthiness, public statements made by the tenant, current economic trends and changes in tenants payment patterns, on a lease-by-lease basis. The Company writes-off the tenant s receivable balance, including the accrued rent receivable, if the Company considers the balances no longer probable of collection. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. If the Company deems the balances no longer probable of collection, the Company writes them off and ceases recognizing lease income, including straight-line rent, unless cash is received. Following a write-off, if (1) the Company subsequently determines that it is probable it will collect substantially all the remaining lessee s lease payments under the lease term and (2) the lease has not been modified since the write-off, the Company will then reinstate the accrued rent and accounts receivable write-offs, adjusting for the amount related to the period when the lease payments were considered not probable of collection. If the Company s estimates of collectability differs from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Company s reported revenue could be impacted. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of the Company s existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of the Company s portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. 
 The Company recognizes acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values as rental revenue over the original term of the respective leases. The impact of the acquired in-place above- and below-market leases increased revenue by approximately million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred (See Leases below). The Company receives reimbursements of payroll and payroll-related costs from unconsolidated joint venture entities and third-party property owners in connection with management services contracts which the Company reflects on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as the Company has determined that it is the principal and not the agent under these arrangements in accordance with the guidance in ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). 
 The Company s parking revenue is derived primarily from monthly and transient daily parking. In addition, the Company has certain lease arrangements for parking accounted for under the guidance in ASC 842 Leases ASC 842 ). The monthly and transient daily parking revenue falls within the scope of ASC 606 and is accounted for at the point in time when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer and the Company s performance obligation is satisfied.

If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA. The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance. 
 The Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes. Specifically, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a million per occurrence limit, and a million annual aggregate limit, million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property. In addition, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its Seattle region with a million per occurrence limit, and a million annual aggregate limit. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property. The amount of the Company s earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact the Company s ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of its earthquake insurance program on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Company s estimation of the value of the coverage. 
 IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Company s earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and the Company s NBCR Coverage. Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of the Company s consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the Company s NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government.

 The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents, in particular, but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which the Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition and results of operations. 
 State and Local Tax Matters 
 Because BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which the Company owns real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. Although the Company believes that it has substantial arguments in favor of its positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 
 Environmental Matters 
 It is the Company s policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with the Company s acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that the Company believes will have a material adverse effect on its business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the Company is not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to its properties that the Company believes would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at the Company s properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. 
 In February 1999, the Company (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. The Company developed an office park on the property. The Company engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to the Company s ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify the Company for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. 
 Environmental investigations at some of the Company s properties and certain properties owned by affiliates of the Company have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case the Company engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. The Company also believes that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although the Company believes that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties

 A holder of an OP Unit may present the OP Unit to BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the OP Unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of Common Stock of BXP. BXP may, in its sole discretion, elect to assume and satisfy the redemption obligation by paying either cash or issuing share of Common Stock.

 Noncontrolling Interests Property Partnerships 
 The noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties. The equity interests in these ventures that are not owned by the Company, totaling approximately billion and billion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are included in Noncontrolling Interests Property Partnerships on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On July 28, 2023, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an institutional investor for the future development of 343 Madison Avenue located on Madison Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets in New York City, New York adjacent to Grand Central Station. Prior to the formation of the joint venture, the Company and the institutional investor were engaged in a collaborative arrangement. The Company owns a interest in the joint venture and its partner owns a interest, and the Company will provide customary development, property management, and leasing services. The joint venture partner contributed approximately million in cash and million in improvements and prepaid ground rent for their ownership interest in the joint venture. The Company contributed approximately million in cash and million in improvements and prepaid ground rent for its ownership interest in the joint venture.

 On November 13, 2023, the Company entered into agreements to sell a interest in 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street, life sciences development projects located in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to an institutional investor (See Note 3). Upon entry into the agreement, the Company completed the sale of a interest in 300 Binney Street. The institutional investor funded approximately million in cash at closing for its investment in 300 Binney Street, including future costs to fund completion of the development project. The Company will retain a ownership interest in the joint venture and fund all remaining costs of the development. The Company has accounted for the transaction as an equity transaction and has recognized noncontrolling interest in its Consolidated Balance Sheets totaling approximately million, which is equal to of the aggregate carrying value of the total equity of the property immediately prior to the transaction. The difference between the cash proceeds received and the noncontrolling interest recognized, which was approximately million, has been reflected as an increase in additional paid-in capital in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Total earned awards under the 2023 MYLTIP, if any, will equal the sum of the number of LTIP Units earned under the two components and will range from to a maximum of LTIP Units with a target of approximately LTIP Units and linear interpolation between zero and maximum. The 2023 MYLTIP awards are in the form of LTIP Units issued on the grant date, and they are subject to forfeiture to the extent awards are not earned. Prior to the performance measurement date holders of the 2023 MYLTIP Units are only entitled to one-tenth of the regular quarterly distributions payable on common partnership units. Following the completion of the three -year performance period, the Company will also make a catch-up cash payment on the 2023 MYLTIP Units that are ultimately earned in an amount equal to the regular and special distributions, if any, declared during the performance period on a number of shares of BXP s Common Stock equal to the number of 2023 MYLTIP Units that are earned, less the distributions actually paid to holders of 2023 MYLTIP Units during the performance period on all of the awarded 2023 MYLTIP Units. Under ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation, the 2023 MYLTIP awards have an aggregate value of approximately million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings under the graded vesting method.

As a result, an aggregate of 2020 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited. 
 On February 4, 2022, the measurement period for the Company s 2019 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP s relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be of target, or an aggregate of approximately million (after giving effect to employee separations). As a result, an aggregate of 2019 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited. 
 On February 5, 2021, the measurement period for the Company s 2018 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP s relative TSR performance, the final awards were determined to be of target, or an aggregate of approximately million (after giving effect to employee separations).

 BXP issued , and shares of restricted common stock and BPLP issued , and LTIP Units to employees and non-employee directors under the 2012 Plan and the 2021 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. BXP did not issue any non-qualified stock options under the 2012 Plan or 2021 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. BPLP issued 2023 MYLTIP Units, 2022 MYLTIP Units and 2021 MYLTIP Units to employees under the 2012 Plan and 2021 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Employees and non-employee directors paid per share of restricted common stock and per LTIP Unit and MYLTIP Unit. When issued, LTIP Units are not economically equivalent in value to a share of Common Stock, but over time can increase in value to one-for-one parity with Common Stock if there is sufficient appreciation in the value of the Company s assets. The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of BXP and BPLP. A majority of the grants of restricted common stock and LTIP Units to employees vest in four equal annual installments. Restricted common stock is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of BXP s Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. Because the 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2023 MYLTIP Units are subject to both a service condition and a market condition, the Company recognizes the related compensation expense under the graded vesting attribution method.

 Exhibit 97.1 

 BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. 
 COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY 
 Boston Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), has adopted a Compensation Recovery Policy (this Policy as described below. 
 1. Overview 
 The Policy sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which the Company shall recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation from Covered Persons (as defined below) in accordance with rules issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the New York Stock Exchange. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section 3 below. 
 2. Compensation Recovery Requirement 
 In the event the Company is required to prepare a Material Financial Restatement, the Company shall reasonably promptly recover all Erroneously Awarded Compensation with respect to such Material Financial Restatement, and each Covered Person shall be required to take all actions necessary to enable such recovery. 
 3. Definitions 
 a. Applicable Recovery Period means with respect to a Material Financial Restatement, the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Restatement Date for such Material Financial Restatement. In addition, in the event the Company has changed its fiscal year (i) any transition period of less than nine months occurring within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years shall also be part of such Applicable Recovery Period and (ii) any transition period of nine to 12 months will be deemed to be a completed fiscal year. 
 b. Applicable Rules means any rules or regulations adopted by the Exchange pursuant to Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or regulations adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 10D of the Exchange Act. 
 c. Board means the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 d. Committee means the Compensation Committee of the Board or, in the absence of such committee, a majority of independent directors serving on the Board. 
 e. Covered Person means any Executive Officer. A person s status as a Covered Person with respect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined as of the time of receipt of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation regardless of the person s current role or status with the Company (e.g., if a person began service as an Executive Officer after the beginning of an Applicable Recovery Period, that person would not be considered a Covered Person with respect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation received before the person began service as an Executive Officer, but would be considered a Covered Person with respect to Erroneously Awarded Compensation received after the person began service as an Executive Officer where such person served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Erroneously Awarded Compensation). 

f. Effective Date means October 2, 2023. 
 g. Erroneously Awarded Compensation means, with respect to a Material Financial Restatement, the amount of any Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Person on or after the Effective Date during the Applicable Recovery Period that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been received by the Covered Person had such compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in a Material Financial Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. Calculation of Erroneously Awarded Compensation with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Material Financial Restatement, shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Material Financial Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received, and the Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Applicable Rules. 
 h. Exchange means the New York Stock Exchange. 
 i. An Executive Officer means any person who served the Company in any of the following roles, received Incentive-Based Compensation after beginning service in any such role (regardless of whether such Incentive-Based Compensation was received during or after such person s service in such role) and served in such role at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation the president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer the controller), any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or finance), any other officer who performs a policy making function, or any other person who performs similar policy making functions for the Company. Executive officers of parents or subsidiaries of the Company may be deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy making functions for the Company. 
 j. Financial Reporting Measures mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures (including, for example, a non-GAAP financial measure), and stock price and total shareholder return. 
 k. Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation provided, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is granted, earned, or vested based, in whole or in part, upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received, earned or vested when the Financial Reporting Measure is attained, not when the actual payment, grant or vesting occurs. 
 l. Material Financial Restatement means an accounting restatement of previously issued financial statements of the Company due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously-issued financial statements that is material to the previously-issued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 2 

m. Prior Policy means the Company s Policy for Recoupment of Incentive Compensation adopted by the Committee on January 8, 2014, which shall continue in effect solely for any compensation received prior to the Effective Date. 
 n. Restatement Date means, with respect to a Material Financial Restatement, the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, as applicable, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare the Material Financial Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare the Material Financial Restatement. 
 4. Exception to Compensation Recovery Requirement 
 The Company may elect not to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy if the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable, and one or more of the following conditions, together with any further requirements set forth in the Applicable Rules, are met (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, and the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation or (ii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to be so qualified under applicable regulations. 
 5. Tax Considerations 
 To the extent that, pursuant to this Policy, the Company is entitled to recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is received by a Covered Person, the gross amount received (i.e., the amount the Covered Person received, or was entitled to receive, before any deductions for tax withholding or other payments) shall be returned by the Covered Person. 
 6. Method of Compensation Recovery 
 The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following 
 a. requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid 
 b. seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer or other disposition of any equity-based awards 
 c. cancelling or rescinding some or all outstanding vested or unvested equity-based awards 
 d. adjusting or withholding from unpaid compensation or other set-off 
 e. cancelling or setting-off against planned future grants of equity-based awards and or 
 f. any other method permitted by applicable law or contract. 
 3 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Covered Person will be deemed to have satisfied such person s obligation to return Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company if such Erroneously Awarded Compensation is returned in the exact same form in which it was received provided that equity withheld to satisfy tax obligations will be deemed to have been received in cash in an amount equal to the tax withholding payment made. 
 7. Policy Interpretation 
 This Policy shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Applicable Rules and any other applicable law and shall otherwise be interpreted (including in the determination of amounts recoverable) in the business judgment of the Committee. To the extent the Applicable Rules require recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation in additional circumstances besides those specified above, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover Incentive-Based Compensation to the fullest extent required by the Applicable Rules. This Policy shall be deemed to be automatically amended, as of the date the Applicable Rules become effective with respect to the Company, to the extent required for this Policy to comply with the Applicable Rules. 
 8. Policy Administration 
 This Policy shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have such powers and authorities related to the administration of this Policy as are consistent with the governing documents of the Company and applicable law. The Committee shall have full power and authority to take, or direct the taking of, all actions and to make all determinations required or provided for under this Policy and shall have full power and authority to take, or direct the taking of, all such other actions and make all such other determinations not inconsistent with the specific terms and provisions of this Policy that the Committee deems to be necessary or appropriate to the administration of this Policy. The interpretation and construction by the Committee of any provision of this Policy and all determinations made by the Committee under this policy shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
 9. Compensation Recovery Repayments not Subject to Indemnification 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any agreement with, or the organizational documents of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Covered Persons are not entitled to indemnification for Erroneously Awarded Compensation recovered under this Policy and, to the extent any such agreement or organizational document purports to provide otherwise, Covered Persons hereby irrevocably agree to forego such indemnification. 
 10. Effect on Prior Policy 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Policy, any Incentive Compensation (as defined in the Prior Policy), including any Incentive-Based Compensation, received by a Covered Person prior to the Effective Date shall remain subject to the terms of the Prior Policy, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall any compensation of a Covered Person be subject to recovery under both this Policy and the Prior Policy. 
 
 Adopted as of October 26, 2023.
