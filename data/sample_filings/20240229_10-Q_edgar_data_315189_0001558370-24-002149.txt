 The allowance for credit losses remained generally flat in the first quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2023, we determined that the financial services business in Russia met the held for sale criteria. The financing receivables in Russia were reclassified to Other assets. The associated allowance for credit losses was reversed and a valuation allowance for the assets held for sale was recorded. These operations were sold in the second quarter of 2023 (see Note 20).

 Modifications We occasionally grant contractual modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties. Before offering a modification, we evaluate the ability of the customer to meet the modified payment terms. Modifications offered include payment deferrals, term extensions, or a combination thereof. Finance charges continue to accrue during the deferral or extension period. Our allowance for credit losses incorporates historical loss information, including the effects of loan modifications with customers. Therefore, additional adjustments to the allowance are generally not recorded upon modification of a loan.

 Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid. Mortgage-backed securities contain prepayment provisions and are not categorized by contractual maturity. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies we use to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheets at fair value: Marketable securities The portfolio of investments is valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds. Funds are valued using the fund s net asset value, based on the fair value of the underlying securities. International debt securities are valued using quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets. Derivatives Our derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards, and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps). The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies. Financing receivables Specific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Fair value hedges: Interest rate contracts Not designated as hedging instruments: Interest rate contracts Foreign exchange contracts Cross-currency interest rate contracts

 Certain of our derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require us to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All amounts are presented in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. OVERVIEW Organization Deere Company is a global leader in the production of agricultural, turf, construction, and forestry equipment and solutions. John Deere Financial provides financing for John Deere equipment, parts, services, and other input costs customers need to run their operations. Our operations are managed through the production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services operating segments. References to equipment operations include PPA, SAT, and CF, while references to agriculture and turf include both PPA and SAT. Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions We announced the Smart Industrial Operating Model in 2020. This operating model is based on three focus areas: (a) Production systems: A strategic alignment of products and solutions around our customers operations. (b) Technology stack: Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to our customers through digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies. (c) Lifecycle solutions: The integration of our aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product. Our Leap Ambitions were launched in 2022. These ambitions are designed to boost economic value and sustainability for our customers. The ambitions align across our customers production systems seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources. In January 2024, we released our 2023 Business Impact Report, available at JohnDeere.com/sustainability. This report identifies important progress on our Leap Ambitions in fiscal year 2023. The information in our 2023 Business Impact Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form a part of, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Trends and Economic Conditions Industry Sales Outlook for Fiscal Year 2024 Agriculture and Turf Construction and Forestry Company Trends Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. Integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. Our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend. These technologies are incorporated into products within each of our operating segments. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. The investments in these technologies and in establishing a Solutions as a Service business model might increase our operating costs and may decrease operating margins during the transition period. In the first quarter of 2024, we announced an agreement with SpaceX to expand machine connectivity for our customers in rural areas through satellite communication. 
 24 

Company Outlook for 2024 Production volumes are expected to decline in 2024 as demand moderates to more normal levels. Agriculture and Turf Outlook for 2024 
 We expect large and small agricultural equipment sales to be down from 2023 levels in North America, Europe, and South America. Sales of compact utility tractors continue to be lower as the industry works to bring down inventory levels, while demand for turf products has stabilized. We continue to produce at levels in line with retail demand in North America. To manage inventory in Europe and Brazil, we are producing at levels below retail demand. Agricultural fundamentals are expected to moderate in 2024 due to lower commodity prices and elevated interest rates, offset by resilient farm balance sheets and lower input costs. The U.S. equipment fleet age is above 20-year averages for both tractors and combines. The dairy and livestock sector continues to benefit from elevated cattle and hay prices. Commodity markets remain disrupted in Central and Eastern Europe due to the Russia/Ukraine war. Western Europe equipment demand is moderately impacted by uncertainty related to current cash crop receipts, agriculture policy changes, and high interest rates. Demand in Brazil is expected to moderate due to adverse weather conditions and high interest rates. Industry sales in Asia are forecasted to be down moderately. Construction and Forestry Outlook for 2024 Construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be down from 2023 levels. Benefits from increasing U.S. infrastructure spending, elevated manufacturing investment levels, and improving single family housing starts are expected to partially offset moderation in office and retail construction. Roadbuilding demand remains strong in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe. Financial Services Outlook for 2024 

Net Income Up moderately + Nonrecurring prior period special items Favorable + Higher average portfolio Favorable (-) Financing spreads Unfavorable (-) Provision for credit losses Unfavorable Additional Trends Agricultural Market Business Cycle. The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers income and may result in lower demand for equipment. We may experience any of the following effects during unfavorable market conditions: lower net sales, higher sales discounts, higher receivable write-offs, or losses on equipment on operating leases. A potential benefit is that customers may invest in integrated technology solutions and precision agriculture to lower input costs and improve margins. Interest Rates. Central bank policy interest rates increased in 2023 and have remained elevated. Increased rates impacted us in several ways, primarily affecting the financing spreads for the financial services operations and demand for our products. The market for our products is negatively impacted by higher interest rates. We expect higher borrowing costs for our customers to primarily affect discretionary and residential product sales in 2024. Most retail customer receivables are fixed rate. Wholesale financing receivables generally are variable rate. Both types of receivables are financed with fixed and floating rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching our receivables with our funding sources. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure. Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from receivable and lease portfolios. As a result, our financial services operations experienced 27 (after-tax) less favorable financing spreads in 2024 compared to 2023. We expect to continue experiencing spread compression in 2024, but at a moderating pace relative to spread compression experienced in 2023. Higher interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when this condition will subside. 
 25 

Other Items of Concern and Uncertainties Other items that could impact our results are: 
 global and regional political conditions, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas, economic, tax, and trade policies, new or retaliatory tariffs, capital market disruptions, foreign currency and capital control policies, regulations and legislation regarding right to repair, weather conditions, marketplace adoption and monetization of technologies we have invested in, our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, volatility in the prices of many commodities, and slower economic growth or recession. consolidated results 2024 Compared with 2023

Critical Accounting Estimates See our critical accounting estimates discussed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of the most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to these policies. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2024 compared with 2023 We have access to global markets at a reasonable cost. Sources of liquidity include: cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes, and bank lines of credit. We closely monitor our cash requirements. Based on the available sources of liquidity, we expect to meet our funding needs in the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). We are forecasting lower operating cash flows in 2024 compared with 2023. We operate in multiple industries, which have unique funding requirements. The equipment operations are capital intensive. Historically, these operations have been subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and receivables from dealers. The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Key metrics are provided in the following table: 

January 28 October 29 January 29 2024 2023 2023 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities 6,273 8,404 4,828 Trade accounts and notes receivable net 7,795 7,739 7,609 Ratio to prior 12 month s net sales 14 14 15 Inventories 8,937 8,160 10,056 Ratio to prior 12 month s cost of sales 24 22 27 Unused credit lines 1,577 841 1,581 Financial Services: Ratio of interest-bearing debt to stockholder s equity 8.3 to 1 8.4 to 1 8.2 to 1 In the first quarter, we invested 128 in U.S. dollar denominated bonds issued by the central bank of Argentina. The bonds are recorded in Marketable securities, classified as International debt securities. These bonds can be held until maturity or sold in a secondary market outside of Argentina to settle intercompany debt (see note 17). The increase in unused credit lines at January 28, 2024 compared to October 29, 2023 relates to a decrease in commercial paper outstanding generally corresponding with the level of receivable and lease portfolios. We forecast lower operating cash flows in 2024 driven by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an unfavorable change in working capital. There have been no material changes to the contractual obligations and other cash requirements identified in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cash Flows 

Three Months Ended January 28 January 29 2024 2023 Net cash used for operating activities (908) (1,246) Net cash provided by investing activities 1,217 760 Net cash used for financing activities (2,645) (339) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 16 62 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (2,320) (763) Cash outflows from consolidated operating activities in the first three months of 2024 were 908. This resulted mainly from a working capital change, partially offset by net income adjusted for non-cash provisions. Cash inflows from investing activities were 1,217 in the first three months of this year. The primary drivers were collections of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) exceeding the cost of receivables acquired and a change in collateral on derivatives net, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment. Cash outflows from financing activities were 2,645 in the first three months of 2024. The increase in cash used for financing activities was due primarily to net payments of borrowings. Cash returned to shareholders was 1,714 in the first three months of 2024. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased 2,320 during the first three months of this year. Key Metrics and Balance Sheet Changes Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable Trade accounts and notes receivable arise from sales of goods to customers. Trade receivables increased by 56 during the first three months of 2024, mostly due to a seasonal increase. These receivables increased 186, compared to a year ago, due to higher dealer inventory levels. The percentage of total worldwide trade receivables outstanding for periods exceeding 12 months was 1 percent at each of January 28, 2024, October 29, 2023, and January 29, 2023. Financing Receivables and Equipment on Operating Leases Financing receivables and equipment on operating leases consist of retail notes originated in connection with financing of new and used equipment, operating leases, revolving charge accounts, sales-type and direct financing leases, and wholesale notes. Financing receivables and equipment on operating leases decreased 1,066 during the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to seasonal payments, and increased 8,386 in the past 12 months, due to strong retail sales. Total acquisition volumes of financing receivables and equipment on operating leases were 16 percent higher in the first three months of 2024, compared with the same period last year, as volumes of wholesale notes, retail notes, and financing leases were higher, while revolving charge accounts and operating leases were lower compared to the same period last year. Inventories Inventories increased by 777 during the first three months, primarily due to a seasonal increase. Inventories decreased 1,119, compared to a year ago, due to lower forecasted shipment volumes. A majority of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment cash expenditures in the first three months of 2024 were 362, compared with 315 in the same period last year. Capital expenditures in 2024 are estimated to be approximately 1,900. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by 2,769 in the first three months of 2024, primarily due to a decrease in accrued expenses associated with employee benefits, dealer sales discounts, and derivative liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased 253 compared to a year ago, due to an increase in accrued expenses associated with extended warranty premium, product warranties, and accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable associated with trade payables. Borrowings Total external borrowings decreased by 245 in the first three months of 2024 and increased 9,102 compared to a year ago, generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and the lease portfolio, as well as other working capital requirements. John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, has a revolving warehouse facility to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 9). The facility was renewed in November 2023 with an expiration in November 2024 and with an increase in the total capacity or financing limit from 1,500 to 2,000. At January 28, 2024, 1,118 of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the facility. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected. In the first three months of 2024, the financial services operations retired 881 of retail note securitization borrowings, which are presented in Net proceeds (payments) in total short-term borrowings (original maturities three months or less). 
 31 

Lines of Credit We also have access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit totaled 10,310 at January 28, 2024, 1,577 of which were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines, commercial paper, and short-term bank borrowings were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at January 28, 2024 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of 5,000, expiring in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of 2,500, expiring in the second quarter of 2027, and 2,500, expiring in the second quarter of 2028. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation and other parts of our business to maintain certain performance metrics and liquidity targets. We expect to extend the terms of these credit facilities. All requirements in the credit agreements have been met during the periods included in the financial statements. Debt Ratings To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold our securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets. The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are as follows: Senior Long-Term Short-Term Outlook Fitch Ratings A+ F1 Stable Moody s Investors Service, Inc.

There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described herein because we do not currently perceive them to be material. SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING DATA The supplemental consolidating data presented on the subsequent pages is presented for informational purposes. Equipment operations represents the enterprise without financial services. Equipment operations includes production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. Transactions between the equipment operations and financial services have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated financial statements. Equipment operations and financial services participate in different industries. Equipment operations primarily generate earnings and cash flows by manufacturing and selling equipment, service parts, and technology solutions to dealers and retail customers. Financial services finances sales and leases by dealers of new and used equipment that is largely manufactured by us. Those earnings and cash flows generally are the difference between the finance income received from customer payments less interest expense, and depreciation on equipment subject to an operating lease. The two businesses are capitalized differently and have separate performance metrics. The supplemental consolidating data is also used by management due to these differences.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK See our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (Part II, Item 7A). There have been no material changes in this information. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) were effective as of January 28, 2024, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. During the first quarter of 2024, there were no changes that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of our business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos-related liability), retail credit, employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters. We believe the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Item 1A. Risk Factors See our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (Part I, Item 1A). There have been no material changes in this information. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Forward-Looking Statements in this report, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties may also materially affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. One should not consider the risk factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Purchases of our common stock during the first quarter of 2024 were as follows: 

Total Number of Shares Purchased as Maximum Number of Total Number of Part of Publicly Shares that May Yet Be Shares Announced Plans or Purchased under the Purchased (2) Average Price Programs (1) Plans or Programs (1) Period (thousands) Per Share (thousands) (millions) Oct 30 to Nov 26 1,178 377.57 1,178 31.8 Nov 27 to Dec 24 1,296 372.25 1,259 30.7 Dec 25 to Jan 28 1,050 393.54 1,050 29.6 Total 3,524 3,487 
 (1) We have a share repurchase plan that was announced in December 2022 to purchase up to 18.0 billion of shares of our common stock. The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under this plan was 29.6 million based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of the end of the first quarter of 2024 of 393.62 per share. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, 11.7 billion of common stock remains to be purchased under this plan. (2) In the first quarter of 2024, 37 thousand shares were acquired from plan participants at a weighted-average market price of 365.60 per share to pay payroll taxes on the vesting of restricted stock awards.

Sales of Unregistered Securities During the first quarter of 2024, we distributed 1,333 deferred stock awards to a participant account under the 2012 Deere Company Nonemployee Director Stock Ownership Plan. The deferred stock awards converted to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Deferred stock units and shares of common stock issued under the 2012 Deere Company Nonemployee Director Stock Ownership Plan are exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 of the SEC s Regulation D thereunder.
