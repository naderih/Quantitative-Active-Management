They also include separately-managed account programs, which are sponsored by financial intermediaries and generally charge an all-inclusive fee covering investment management, trade execution, asset allocation, and custodial and administrative services. In addition, we provide distribution, shareholder servicing, transfer agency services and administrative services for our Retail Products and Services. See Net Revenues Investment Advisory and Services Fees in Item 7 for information about our retail investment advisory and services fees. See Note 2 to AB s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the commissions we pay to financial intermediaries in connection with the sale of open-end AB Funds.

 Bernstein Research Services 
 We offer high-quality fundamental and quantitative research and trade execution services in equities and listed options to institutional investors, such as mutual fund and hedge fund managers, pension funds and other institutional investors "Bernstein Research Services" or " BRS " . We serve our clients, which are based in major markets around the world, through our trading professionals, who are primarily based in New York, London and Hong Kong, and our research analysts, who provide fundamental company and industry research along with quantitative research into securities valuation and factors affecting stock-price movements. 
 Additionally, we occasionally provide equity capital markets services to issuers of publicly traded securities, such as initial public offerings and follow-on offerings, generally acting as co-manager in such offerings. 
 We earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser but increasing extent, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments. Bernstein Research Services accounted for approximately 9 , 10 and 10 of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 For information regarding trends in fee rates charged for brokerage transactions, see Risk Factors in Item 1A . 
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, AB and Soci t G n rale (EURONEXT: GLE, SocGen ), a leading European bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As a result, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial condition. For further discussion, s ee Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to AB's consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

 Custody 
 Our U.S. based broker-dealer subsidiary acts as custodian for the majority of our Private Wealth Management AUM and some of our Institutional AUM. Other custodian arrangements, directed by clients, include banks, trust companies, brokerage firms and other financial institutions. 
 People Management 
 As a leading global investment management and research firm, we bring together a wide range of insights, expertise and innovations to advance the interests of our clients around the world. The intellectual capital and distinctive knowledge of our employees are collectively the most important assets of our firm, so the long-term sustainability and success of our firm is heavily dependent on our people. In 2022, our human capital and administrative services teams became our "People" team, a key acknowledgement of the central role they play in supporting our employees and advancing their work experience. We are keenly focused on: 
 fostering an inclusive culture by incorporating diversity, equity and inclusion in all levels of our business; 
 encouraging innovation; 
 developing, retaining and recruiting high quality talent; and 
 aligning employees incentives and risk taking with those of the firm. 
 As a result, we have a strong firm culture that helps us maximize performance and drive excellence. Further, our firm s role as a fiduciary is embedded in our culture. As a fiduciary, our firm s primary objective is to act in our clients' best interests and help them reach their financial goals. 
 Also, our Board of Directors (the " Board ") and committees of the Board, particularly our Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee, provide oversight into various matters affecting our people, including emerging people management risks and strategies to mitigate our exposure to those risks. These collaborative efforts contribute to the overall framework that guides how AB attracts, retains and develops a workforce that supports our values and strategic initiatives.

 Talent Acquisition and Development 
 AB seeks to achieve excellence in business, including investment performance, client service, and being defined as an employer of choice. Across our global offices, we recruit and hire a workforce with diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. Our talent acquisition strategy helps us serve both our clients and our workforce, hand in hand, at an optimal level. We engage external organizations, including search firms and partnerships to assist in attracting and recruiting top talent at all levels. We also leverage technology tools to source and evaluate candidates against our needs and we continue to prioritize attracting diverse talent throughout our search activities. Outside of traditional recruiting, we believe investing in emerging talent is key to our future planning. Both our internship and associate programs serve as robust pipelines for future leadership. The talent acquisition process is our firm s first impression to future employees, and we strive to provide all candidates with an excellent experience. We focus heavily on high candidate engagement, an efficient offer process and sound onboarding to support success. Investing in the continued development of our talent is ongoing through a blend of formal training, independent learning, mentoring, and progressing assignments of responsibility. Internal mobility is championed throughout the firm. We are highly committed to development and believe that top performers expect and deserve this ongoing investment. 
 Employee Engagement and Culture 
 We believe a workforce is most engaged when employees feel connected to our culture. We seek to create a workplace where our people recognize the high importance of the work they do and enjoy the environment where the work gets done. By creating a culture of excellence and accountability, we see employees thrive and contribute at their highest levels. It is important that our employees are not only connected to our business but also to the communities in which we operate. We offer many opportunities to volunteer, including our firm-wide philanthropic initiative, AB Gives Back. Coming out of the global pandemic, we continue to prioritize the well-being of our staff through our global wellness programming, employee wellness groups, and our hybrid work schedule. We believe that the flexibility to work remotely up to two days per week allows our employees to maintain the important benefits of in-person collaboration while providing greater work-life balance. Measuring engagement is key to understanding the views of the organization. We utilize AB Voice, a periodic engagement survey designed to measure employee sentiment, to identify and address gaps that could impact productivity and retention. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 The past year has been a robust year for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (" DEI ") as we continued to focus on delivering equitable positive outcomes across the various segments of our business: colleagues, clients and communities. These elements included increasing education and support to address emerging topics, retaining and developing key diverse talent segments, improving data capture and reporting capabilities and scaling infrastructure for a more global, distributed DEI and philanthropy model. As DEI was again catapulted into the spotlight for a myriad of reasons, these elements have allowed for a more intentional, consistent approach and have acted to accelerate the overall success of the strategy. Furthermore, our Board and Board committees evaluate the overall effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs and recommend changes to management as necessary. 
 Over the past few years, we have seen an increase in social issues being brought to the forefront of national and global conversations including in the workplace. In an effort to appropriately respond to such issues, we formed the Social Response Committee (the " SRC "). The SRC has developed an approach to value-driven action that is rooted in broad evaluation of the various issues integrated with AB s purpose and values to maintain consistency in decision making. The SRC s remit is to surface, review and direct AB s public or internal response to social issues that impact our business and our people. 
 Data is at the heart of a strong and agile DEI strategy and serves as an incredibly effective tool to best uncover gaps and determine key focus areas. This year, we continued to closely monitor internal quantitative and qualitative metrics such as our AB Voice employee engagement survey to measure progress and determine which populations may require additional focus and development. We also leveraged external data sources such as the Investment Company Institute Asset Management D I benchmarking survey, Disability Equality Index and Coqual s Asian/Asian American and Pacific Islander focused research to maintain awareness of how we are performing relative to peers and competitors and ensure alignment with common practices. 
 As global demographics change and employee needs and expectations evolve, providing platforms for education and productive discourse becomes even more critical. In 2023, we introduced several intentional engagement and retention initiatives including disability inclusion, expanded programs and focus groups. Our Employee Resource Groups which hosted over 50 events, remain essential to AB s commitment to inclusivity as they not only encourage a positive work culture, but also contribute to business development and the professional development of employees worldwide.

 Compensation and Benefits 
 We recognize the role that a competitive total rewards offering plays in attracting and retaining top talent. Our pay practices include base salaries, annual cash bonuses, and, for employees with total compensation over 300,000 annually, a long-term incentive compensation award. These awards are generally denominated in restricted AB Holding Units. We utilize this structure with intentionality to foster a stronger sense of ownership by employees, aligning their interests directly with the interests of our Unitholders and indirectly with the interests of our clients. We are a meritocracy and pay for performance under the auspices of providing compensation that is competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, performance, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. Annually, we engage a compensation consulting firm to independently evaluate the accuracy of our executive compensation and to provide benchmarking against our industry peers. We also use these insights to make pay decisions for the broader organization. Periodically, we engage outside counsel to conduct privileged pay equity reviews. Pay is evaluated on an annual basis, with the firm providing merit-based and cost of living annual base salary increases, as well as incentive compensation. This information is communicated to employees at year-end. On occasion, pay is adjusted off-cycle due to internal transfer and/or promotion. Based on unique geographies, the firm makes benefits available to all eligible employees, including health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan, and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits, ranging from adoption and surrogacy assistance to tuition reimbursement, which allows employees to select the options that meet their individual needs. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2023, our firm had 4,707 full-time employees, including 284 new hires onboarded during the first quarter of 2023, which were previously outsourced consultants in Pune, India.

 History and Structure 
 We have been in the investment research and management business for more than 50 years. Bernstein was founded in 1967. Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment management department of Donaldson, Lufkin Jenrette, Inc. (since November 2000, a part of Credit Suisse Group) merged with the investment advisory business of Moody s Investors Service, Inc. 
 In April 1988, AB Holding went public as a master limited partnership. AB Holding Units, which trade under the ticker symbol AB, have been listed on the NYSE since that time. 
 In October 1999, AB Holding reorganized by transferring its business and assets to AB, a newly-formed operating partnership, in exchange for all of the AB Units (the Reorganization ). Since the date of the Reorganization, AB has conducted the business formerly conducted by AB Holding and AB Holding s activities have consisted of owning AB Units and engaging in related activities. Unlike AB Holding Units, AB Units do not trade publicly and are subject to significant restrictions on transfer. The General Partner is the general partner of both AB and AB Holding. 
 In October 2000, our two legacy firms, Alliance Capital and Bernstein, combined, bringing together Alliance Capital s expertise in growth equity and corporate fixed income investing and its family of retail mutual funds, with Bernstein s expertise in value equity investing, tax-exempt fixed income management, and its Private Wealth Management and Bernstein Research Services businesses.

 Part I 

 As of December 31, 2023, the condensed ownership structure of AB is as follows (for a more complete description of our ownership structure, see Principal Security Holders in Item 12 ): 
 
 The General Partner owns 100,000 general partnership units in AB Holding and a 1.0 general partnership interest in AB. Including these general partnership interests, EQH, directly and through certain of its subsidiaries see Principal Security Holders in Item 12 ), had an approximate 61.2 economic interest in AB as of December 31, 2023. 
 Competition 
 We compete in all aspects of our business with numerous investment management firms, mutual fund sponsors, brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives as those we offer. Our competitors offer a wide range of financial services to the same customers that we seek to serve. Some of our competitors are larger, have a broader range of product choices and investment capabilities, conduct business in more markets, and have substantially greater resources than we do. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current client relationships, and create new ones, will be successful. 
 In addition, EQH and its subsidiaries provide financial services, some of which compete with those we offer. The AB Partnership Agreement specifically allows EQH and its subsidiaries (other than the General Partner) to compete with AB and to pursue opportunities that may be available to us. EQH and certain of its subsidiaries have substantially greater financial resources than we do and are not obligated to provide resources to us. 
 To grow our business, we believe we must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include: 
 our investment performance for clients; 
 our commitment to place the interests of our clients first; 
 the quality of our research; 
 our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, personnel; 
 the array of investment products we offer; 
 the fees we charge; 
 Morningstar/Lipper rankings for the AB Funds; 
 our ability to sell our actively-managed investment services despite the fact that many investors favor passive services; 
 our operational effectiveness; 
 our ability to further develop and market our brand; and 
 our global presence. 
 Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with the other factors we discuss in Risk Factors in Item 1A .

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Please consider this section along with the description of our business in Item 1 , the competition section immediately above and AB s financial information contained in Items 7 and 8 . The majority of the risk factors discussed below directly affect AB. These risk factors also affect AB Holding because AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB. See also Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 . 
 Business-related Risks 
 Our revenues and results of operations depend on the market value and composition of our AUM, which can fluctuate significantly based on various factors, including many factors outside of our control. 
 We derive most of our revenues from investment advisory and services fees, which typically are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of the account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. The value and composition of our AUM can be adversely affected by several factors, including: 
 Market Factors . Our AUM remain sensitive to the volatility associated with global financial market conditions. For example, the heightened global inflationary pressures that resulted in sizable interest rate increases and associated market volatility in 2022 and 2023. We recognize that, due to continued uncertainty associated with the global response to heightened global inflationary pressures, markets may remain volatile and, accordingly, there remains risk of a significant reduction in our revenues and net income in future periods. Global economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, which increases the probability that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact a different country or region. Conditions affecting the general economy, including political, social or economic instability at the local, regional or global level may also affect the market value of our AUM. War, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the middle east, or civil disturbance, acts of terrorism (whether foreign or domestic), health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as other incidents that interrupt the expected course of events, such as natural disasters, power outages and other unforeseeable and external events, and the public response to or fear of such diseases or events, have had and may in the future have a significant adverse effect on financial markets and our AUM, revenues and net income. Also, significant market volatility and uncertainty, and reductions in the availability of margin financing, can significantly limit the liquidity of certain asset backed and other securities, making it at times impossible to sell these securities at prices reflecting their true economic value. While liquidity conditions were relatively stable in 2023 despite market volatility, we recognize the possibility that conditions could deteriorate in the future. Lack of liquidity makes it more difficult for our funds to meet redemption requests. If liquidity were to worsen, this may have a significant adverse effect on our AUM, revenues and net income in the future. 
 Client Preferences . Generally, our clients may withdraw their assets at any time and on short notice. Also, changing market dynamics and investment trends, particularly with respect to sponsors of defined benefit plans choosing to invest in less risky investments and the ongoing shift to lower-fee passive services described below, may continue to reduce interest in some of the investment products we offer, and/or clients and prospects may continue to seek investment products that we may not currently offer. Loss of, or decreases in, AUM reduces our investment advisory and services fees and revenues. 
 2023 Annual Report 17

 Part I 

 Our Investment Performance . Our ability to achieve investment returns for clients that meet or exceed investment returns for comparable asset classes and competing investment services is a key consideration when clients decide to keep their assets with us or invest additional assets, and when a prospective client is deciding whether to invest with us. Poor investment performance, both in absolute terms and/or relative to peers and stated benchmarks, may result in clients withdrawing assets and prospective clients choosing to invest with competitors. 
 Investing Trends . Our fee rates can vary significantly among the various investment products and services we offer to our clients see Net Revenues in Item 7 for additional information regarding our fee rates); our fee realization rate fluctuates as clients shift assets between accounts or products with different fee structures. 
 Service Changes . We may be required to reduce our fee levels, restructure the fees we charge and/or adjust the services we offer to our clients because of, among other things, regulatory initiatives (whether industry-wide or specifically targeted), changing technology in the asset management business (including algorithmic strategies and emerging financial technology), court decisions and competitive considerations. A reduction in fee levels would reduce our revenues. 
 Interest Rate Changes . Investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income and multi-asset investment portfolios can be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, particularly if interest rates increase substantially and quickly. 
 A decrease in the value of our AUM, a decrease in the amount of AUM we manage, an adverse mix shift in our AUM and/or a reduction in the level of fees we charge would adversely affect our investment advisory fees and revenues. A reduction in revenues, without a commensurate reduction in expenses, adversely affects our results of operations. 
 The industry-wide shift from actively managed investment services to passive services has adversely affected our investment advisory and services fees, revenues and results of operations, and this trend may continue. 
 Our competitive environment has become increasingly difficult, as active managers, which invest based on individual security selection, have, on average, consistently underperformed passive services, which invest based on market indices. In the most recent period this trend reversed, as active performance relative to benchmarks improved, with 57 of active managers outperforming their passive benchmarks for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023 (latest data available), compared to 43 for the prior 12-month period. 57 of active US stock funds outperformed, up from 48 the prior year, while 63 of active non-U.S. stock funds outperformed their benchmarks, up from just 33 the prior period. Performance of actively managed bond funds also improved in 2023, with 55 outperforming benchmarks, up from just 30 in the prior-year period. 
 Flows into actively managed funds substantially improved industry-wide in 2023, with U.S. industry-wide active mutual fund inflows of 549 billion in 2023, compared with outflows of 931 billion in 2022. The improvement was led by 927 billion in inflows to Money Market funds, as investors responded to the higher interest rate environment. Active fixed income U.S. mutual funds also experienced improvement, with inflows of 16 billion in 2023, compared with outflows of 465 billion in 2022. Active equity U.S. mutual fund outflows were 246 billion in 2023, compared to outflows of 235 billion in 2022. Demand for passive strategies in the U.S. continued to grow, though at a reduced rate from the prior year, as industry-wide total passive mutual fund net inflows of 489 billion in 2023 compared to 540 billion in 2022. Organic growth through net inflows continues to be difficult to achieve for active managers, such as AB, and requires taking market share from other active managers. 
 The significant shift from active services to passive services adversely affects Bernstein Research Services revenues as well. Institutional global market trading volumes continue to be pressured by persistent active equity outflows and passive equity inflows. As a result, portfolio turnover has declined and investors hold fewer shares that are actively traded by managers. 
 Our reputation could suffer if we are unable to deliver consistent, competitive investment performance. 
 Our business is based on the trust and confidence of our clients. Damage to our reputation, resulting from poor or inconsistent investment performance, among other factors, can reduce substantially our AUM and impair our ability to maintain or grow our business. 
 EQH and its subsidiaries provide a significant amount of our AUM and fund a significant portion of our seed investments, and if our agreements with them terminate or they withdraw capital support it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. 
 EQH (our parent company) and its subsidiaries constitute our largest client. Our EQH affiliates represented approximately 16 of our AUM as of December 31, 2023, and we earned approximately 5 of our net revenues from services we provided to them. Our related investment management agreements are terminable at any time or on short notice by either party, and EQH is not under any obligation to maintain any level of AUM with us. A material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could result if EQH were to terminate its investment management agreements with us.

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 Our business is dependent on investment advisory agreements with clients, and selling and distribution agreements with various financial intermediaries and consultants, which generally are subject to termination or non-renewal on short notice. 
 We derive most of our revenues pursuant to written investment management agreements (or other arrangements) with institutional investors, mutual funds and private wealth clients, and selling and distribution agreements with financial intermediaries that distribute AB Funds. Generally, the investment management agreements (and other arrangements), including our agreements with EQH and its subsidiaries, are terminable at any time or upon relatively short notice by either party. The investment management agreements pursuant to which we manage the U.S. Funds must be renewed and approved by the Funds boards of directors annually. A significant majority of the directors are independent. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund will approve the fund s investment management agreement each year, or will not condition its approval on revised terms that may be adverse to us. In addition, investors in AB Funds can redeem their investments without notice. Any termination of, or failure to renew, a significant number of these agreements, or a significant increase in redemption rates, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Similarly, the selling and distribution agreements with securities firms, brokers, banks and other financial intermediaries are terminable by either party upon notice (generally 30 days) and do not obligate the financial intermediary to sell any specific amount of fund shares. These intermediaries generally offer their clients investment products that compete with our products. In addition, certain institutional investors rely on consultants to advise them about choosing an investment adviser and some of our services may not be considered among the best choices by these consultants. As a result, investment consultants may advise their clients to move their assets invested with us to other investment advisers, which could result in significant net outflows. 
 Lastly, our Private Wealth Services rely on referrals from financial planners, registered investment advisers and other professionals. We cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to, or receive referrals from, these third parties. Loss of such access or referrals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Performance-based fee arrangements with our clients may cause greater fluctuations in our net revenues. 
 We sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees, whereby we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account under-performs relative to its performance target (whether in absolute terms or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such under-performance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve the performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. 
 We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 9.3 , 8.3 and 0.4 of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 5.6 of our AUM). If the percentage of our AUM subject to performance-based fees increases, seasonality and volatility of revenue and earnings are likely to become more significant. Our performance-based fees were 144.9 million, 145.2 million and 245.1 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The revenues generated by Bernstein Research Services may be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control, including declines in brokerage transaction rates, declines in global market volumes, failure to settle our trades by significant counterparties. 
 Electronic, or low-touch, trading represents a significant percentage of buy-side trading activity and typically produces transaction fees that are significantly lower than traditional full-service fee rates. As a result, blended pricing throughout our industry is lower now than it was historically, and price declines may continue. In addition, fee rates we charge and charged by other brokers for brokerage services have historically experienced price pressure, and we expect these trends to continue. Also, while increases in transaction volume and market share often can offset decreases in rates, this may not continue. 
 In addition, the failure or inability of any of our broker-dealer's significant counterparties to perform could expose us to substantial expenditures and adversely affect our revenues. For example, SCB LLC, as a member of clearing and settlement organizations, would be required to settle open trades of any non-performing counterparty. This exposes us to the mark-to-market adjustment on the trades between trade date and settlement date, which could be significant, especially during periods of severe market volatility. Also, our ability to access liquidity in such situations may be limited by what our funding relationships are able to offer us at such times. 
 Lastly, extensive changes proposed by the SEC to the equity market structure, including Regulation Best Execution, the proposed Order Competition Rule, the proposed volume-based exchange transaction pricing rule and proposed changes to Regulation NMS establishing, among other things, minimum pricing increments and required disclosures by larger broker-dealers and specified trading platforms, if adopted as proposed, could substantially increase the cost of conducting our buy-side and broker-dealer operations and, possibly, adversely impact trade execution quality.

 Part I 

 We may be unable to develop new products and services, and the development of new products and services may expose us to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk. 
 Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to react nimbly to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client needs, and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. Conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with concentrations in industries or sectors specific to individual client criteria, or with a focus on ESG, requires continuous innovative effort on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, and compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements. We can make no assurance that we will be able to develop new products and services that successfully address the needs of clients within needed timeframes. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm our reputation and expose us to additional costs, which could adversely affect our AUM, revenues and operating income. 
 Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various other currencies can adversely affect our AUM, revenues and results of operations. 
 Although significant portions of our net revenues and expenses, as well as our AUM, presently are denominated in U.S. dollars, we have subsidiaries and clients outside of the United States with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Weakening of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the value in U.S. dollar terms of our revenues and our AUM denominated in these other currencies. Accordingly, fluctuations in U.S. dollar exchange rates affect our AUM, revenues and reported financial results from one period to the next. 
 We may not be successful in our efforts to hedge our exposure to such fluctuations, which could negatively impact our revenues and reported financial results. 
 Our seed capital investments are subject to market risk. While we enter into various futures, forwards, swap and option contracts to economically hedge many of these investments, we also may be exposed to market risk and credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative instruments. 
 We have a seed investment program for the purpose of building track records and assisting with the marketing initiatives pertaining to our firm's new products. These seed capital investments are subject to market risk. Our risk management team oversees a seed hedging program that attempts to minimize this risk, subject to practical and cost considerations. Also, not all seed investments are deemed appropriate to hedge, and in those cases we are exposed to market risk. In addition, we may be subject to basis risk in that we cannot always hedge with precision our market exposure and, as a result, we may be subject to relative spreads between market sectors. As a result, volatility in the capital markets may cause significant changes in our period-to-period financial and operating results. 
 We use various derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps and option contracts, in conjunction with our seed hedging program. While in most cases broad market risks are hedged, our hedges are imperfect and some market risk remains. In addition, our use of derivatives results in counterparty risk i.e., the risk that we may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative instruments), regulatory risk e.g. , short selling restrictions) and cash/synthetic basis risk i.e., the risk that the underlying positions do not move identically to the related derivative instruments). 
 We may engage in strategic transactions that could pose risks. 
 As part of our business strategy, we consider potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions (such as our purchase of CarVal Investors in 2022), dispositions, mergers, consolidations, joint venture partnerships (such as our planned joint venture partnership with SocGen) and similar transactions, some of which may be material. These transactions, if undertaken, may involve various risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: 
 adverse effects on our earnings if acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; 
 existence of unknown liabilities or contingencies that arise after closing; 
 potential disputes with counterparties; and 
 the possible need for us to increase our firm's leverage or, if we fund the purchase price of a transaction with AB Units or AB Holding Units, likely dilution to our existing unitholders. 
 Acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could under-perform relative to expectations. Additionally, the loss of investment personnel poses the risk that we may lose the AUM we expected to manage, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

 Part I 

 We may not accurately value the securities we hold on behalf of our clients or our company investments. 
 In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, contractual obligations or client direction, we employ procedures for the pricing and valuation of securities and other positions held in client accounts or for company investments. We have established a Valuation Committee and sub-committees, consisting of senior officers and employees, which oversee a consistent framework of pricing controls and valuation processes for the firm and each of its advisory affiliates. If market quotations for a security are not readily available, the Valuation Committee determines a fair value for the security. 
 Extraordinary volatility in financial markets, significant liquidity constraints or our failure to adequately consider one or more factors when determining the fair value of a security based on information with limited market observability could result in our failing to properly value securities we hold for our clients or investments accounted for on our balance sheet. Improper valuation likely would result in our basing fee calculations on inaccurate AUM figures, our striking incorrect net asset values for company-sponsored mutual funds or hedge funds or, in the case of company investments, our inaccurately calculating and reporting our financial condition and operating results. Although the overall percentage of our AUM that we fair value based on information with limited market observability is not significant, inaccurate fair value determinations can harm our clients, create regulatory issues and damage our reputation. 
 The quantitative and systematic models we use in certain of our investment services may contain errors, resulting in imprecise risk assessments and unintended output. 
 We use quantitative and systematic models in a variety of our investment services, usually in combination with fundamental research. These models are developed by senior quantitative professionals and typically are implemented by IT professionals. Our Model Risk Oversight Committee oversees the model governance framework and associated model review activities, which are then executed by our Model Risk Team. However, due to the complexity and large data dependency of such models, it is possible that errors in the models could exist and our controls could fail to detect such errors. Failure to detect errors could result in client losses and reputational damage. 
 The financial services industry is intensely competitive. 
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including our investment performance for our clients, our array of investment services, innovation, reputation and price. By having a global presence, we often face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain and/or continue to improve our investment performance, our client flows may be adversely affected, which may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. 
 Also, increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. For additional information regarding competitive factors, see Competition in Item 1 . 
 People-related Risks 
 We may be unable to continue to attract, motivate and retain key personnel, and the cost to retain key personnel could put pressure on our adjusted operating margin. 
 Our business depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, technical, investment, managerial and executive personnel, and there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. 
 The market for these professionals is extremely competitive. Certain of these professionals often maintain strong, personal relationships with investors in our products and other members of the business community so their departure may cause us to lose client accounts or result in fewer opportunities to win new business, either of which factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Additionally, a decline in revenues may limit our ability to pay our employees at competitive levels, and maintaining (or increasing) compensation without a revenue increase, in order to retain key personnel, may adversely affect our operating margin. For additional information regarding our compensation practices, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in Item 11. 
 Our process of relocating our headquarters may not be executed as we have envisioned. 
 We have established our corporate headquarters in and have relocated a large number of the positions jobs previously located in the New York metropolitan area to Nashville, Tennessee (for additional information, see Relocation Strategy in Item 7 ). Although the ongoing impact on AB from this process is not yet known, the uncertainty created by these circumstances could adversely affect AB s ability to motivate and retain current employees and hire qualified employees in our Nashville headquarters. 
 Additionally, our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings relating to our headquarters relocation are based on our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. If our assumptions turn out to be inaccurate, our expenses and operating income could be adversely affected.

 Employee misconduct, which can be difficult to detect and deter, could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant regulatory scrutiny, legal liability and reputational harm. 
 There have been several highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry generally, and we are not immune. Misconduct by employees could involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which could result in legal action, regulatory sanctions, and reputational or financial harm. Further, fraud, payment or solicitation of bribes and other deceptive practices or other misconduct by our employees could similarly subject us to regulatory scrutiny, legal liability and reputational damage. 
 Operational, Technology and Cyber-related Risks 
 Technology failures and disruptions, including failures to properly safeguard confidential information, can significantly constrain our operations and result in significant time and expense to remediate, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects. 
 We are highly dependent on software and related technologies throughout our business, including both proprietary systems and those provided by third-party vendors. We use our technology to, among other things, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions, store and maintain data, and provide reports and other services to our clients. Despite our protective measures, including measures designed to effectively secure information through system security technology and established and tested business continuity plans, we may still experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, hardware failures, software defects, power outages, acts of war and third-party failures. We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. These adverse effects could include the inability to perform critical business functions or failure to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, which could lead to loss of client confidence, reputational damage, exposure to disciplinary action and liability to our clients. 
 Many of the software applications that we use in our business are licensed from, and supported, upgraded and maintained by, third-party vendors. A suspension or termination of certain of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause temporary system delays or interruption. Additionally, technology rapidly evolves and we cannot guarantee that our competitors may not implement more advanced technology platforms for their products and services, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our results of operations and business prospects. 
 Also, we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information. As part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations. Although we take protective measures, our systems still could be vulnerable to cyber attack or other forms of unauthorized access (including computer viruses) that have a security impact, such as an authorized employee or vendor inadvertently or intentionally causing us to release confidential or proprietary information. Such disclosure could, among other things, allow competitors access to our proprietary business information and require significant time and expense to investigate and remediate the breach. Moreover, loss of confidential client information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. 
 Any significant security breach of our information and cyber security infrastructure, as well as our failure to properly escalate and respond to such an incident, may significantly harm our operations and reputation. 
 It is critical that we ensure the continuity and effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure, policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them and contracted third-party systems. Although we take protective measures, including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, supply chain attacks, computer viruses or other events that have a security impact, such as an external attack by one or more cyber criminals (including phishing attacks attempting to obtain confidential information and ransomware attacks attempting to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid), which could materially harm our operations and reputation. Additionally, while we take precautions to password protect and encrypt our laptops and sensitive information on our other mobile electronic devices, if such devices are stolen, misplaced or left unattended, they may become vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use, creating a possible security risk and resulting in potentially costly actions by us. 
 Furthermore, although we maintain a robust cyber security infrastructure and incident preparedness strategy, which we test frequently, we may be unable to respond, both internally and externally, to a cyber incident in a sufficiently expeditious manner. Any such failure could cause significant harm to our reputation and result in litigation, regulatory scrutiny and/or significant remediation costs, see "Cybersecurity" in Item 1C .

 Climate change and other unpredictable events, including outbreak of infectious disease, natural disaster, dangerous weather conditions, technology failure, terrorist attack and political unrest, may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. 
 War, terrorist attack, political unrest, power failure, climate change, natural disaster and rapid spread of infectious disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) could interrupt our operations by: 
 causing disruptions in global economic conditions, thereby decreasing investor confidence and making investment products generally less attractive; 
 inflicting loss of life; 
 triggering large-scale technology failures or delays; 
 breaching our information and cyber security infrastructure; and 
 requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage and restore operations. 
 Furthermore, climate change may increase the severity and frequency of catastrophes, or adversely affect our investment portfolio or investor sentiment. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of weather-related disasters and pandemics. And, climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities in which we invest, or our willingness to continue to invest in such securities. 
 Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place, including system security measures, information back-up and disaster recovery processes, our ability to conduct business, including in key business centers where we have significant operations, such as Nashville, Tennessee, New York City, San Antonio, Texas, London, England, Hong Kong, and India, may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services we may use or third parties with which we conduct business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to conduct business with and on behalf of our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. Furthermore, unauthorized access to our systems as a result of a security breach, the failure of our systems, or the loss of data could give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation. 
 Our operations require experienced, professional staff. Loss of a substantial number of such persons or an inability to provide properly equipped places for them to work may, by disrupting our operations, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. In addition, our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses, failures or breaches that may occur. 
 Our own operational failures or those of third parties on which we rely, including failures arising out of human error, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and reduce our revenues. 
 Weaknesses or failures in our internal processes or systems could lead to disruption of our operations, liability to clients, exposure to disciplinary action or harm to our reputation. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, large numbers of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions generally must comply with client investment guidelines, as well as stringent legal and regulatory standards. 
 Our obligations to clients require us to exercise skill, care and prudence in performing our services. Despite our employees being highly trained and skilled, the large number of transactions we process makes it highly likely that errors will occasionally occur. If we make a mistake in performing our services that causes financial harm to a client, we have a duty to act promptly to put the client in the position the client would have been in had we not made the error. The occurrence of mistakes, particularly significant ones, can have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and business prospects. 
 The individuals and third-party vendors on whom we rely to perform services for us or our clients may be unable or unwilling to honor their contractual obligations to us. 
 We rely on various counterparties and other third-party vendors to augment our existing investment, operational, financial and technological capabilities, but the use of a third-party vendor does not diminish AB's responsibility to ensure that client and regulatory obligations are met. Default rates, credit downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of market stress. Disruptions in the financial markets and other economic challenges may cause our counterparties and other third-party vendors to experience significant cash flow problems or even render them insolvent, which may expose us to significant costs and impair our ability to conduct business. 
 Weaknesses or failures within a third-party vendor's internal processes or systems, or inadequate business continuity plans, can materially disrupt our business operations. Also, third-party vendors may lack the necessary infrastructure or resources to effectively safeguard our confidential data. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with such third-party relationships, we may suffer fines, disciplinary action and reputational damage.

 We may not always successfully manage actual and potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business. 
 Increasingly, we must manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. Failure to adequately address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and business prospects. 
 We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information. However, appropriately managing conflicts of interest is complex. Our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with actual or perceived conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. 
 Maintaining adequate liquidity for our general business needs depends on certain factors, including operating cash flows and our access to credit on reasonable terms. 
 Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow AUM and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to issue public or private debt on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our profitability, our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates. Furthermore, our access to credit on reasonable terms is partially dependent on our firm s credit ratings. 
 Both Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor's Rating Service affirmed AB s long-term and short-term credit ratings and indicated a stable outlook in 2023. Future changes in our credit ratings are possible and any downgrade to our ratings is likely to increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets. If this occurs, we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our strategic plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
 An impairment of goodwill may occur. 
 Determining whether an impairment of the goodwill asset exists requires management to exercise a substantial amount of judgment. In addition, to the extent that securities valuations are depressed for prolonged periods of time and/or market conditions deteriorate, or if we experience significant net redemptions, our AUM, revenues, profitability and unit price will be adversely affected. Although the price of an AB Holding Unit is just one factor in the calculation of fair value, if AB Holding Unit price levels decline significantly, reaching the conclusion that fair value exceeds carrying value will, over time, become more difficult. In addition, control premiums, industry earnings multiples and discount rates are impacted by economic conditions. As a result, subsequent impairment tests may occur more frequently and be based on more negative assumptions and future cash flow projections, and may result in an impairment of goodwill. An impairment may result in a material charge to our earnings. For additional information about our impairment testing, see Item 7 . 
 The insurance that we purchase may not fully cover all potential exposures. 
 We maintain professional liability, errors omissions, fidelity, cyber, property, casualty, business interruption and other types of insurance, but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the operation of our business. Our coverage is subject to exclusions and limitations, including high self-insured retentions or deductibles and maximum limits and liabilities covered. In addition, from time to time, various types of insurance may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or, in some cases, at all. We can make no assurance that a claim or claims will be covered by our insurance policies or, if covered, will not exceed our available insurance coverage, or that our insurers will remain solvent and meet their obligations. 
 In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, if at all, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. Also, we currently are party to certain joint insurance arrangements with subsidiaries of EQH. If our affiliates choose not to include us as insured parties under any such policies, we may need to obtain stand-alone insurance coverage, which could have coverage terms that are less beneficial to us and/or cost more. 
 Legal and Regulatory-related Risks 
 Our business is subject to pervasive, complex and continuously evolving global regulation, compliance with which involves substantial expenditures of time and money, and violation of which may result in material adverse consequences. 
 Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, rules of securities regulators and exchanges, and laws and regulations in the foreign jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business. If we violate these laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability or sanction, including restriction or revocation of our and our subsidiaries professional licenses or registrations, revocation of the licenses of our employees, censures, fines, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. A regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanction, could require substantial expenditures of time and money and could potentially damage our reputation.

 Part I 

 In recent years, global regulators have substantially increased their oversight of financial services. Some of the newly-adopted and proposed regulations are focused on investment management services. Others, while more broadly focused, nonetheless impact our business. Moreover, the adoption of new laws, regulations or standards and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, regulations or standards have directly affected, and will continue to affect, our business, including making our efforts to comply more expensive and time-consuming. 
 For example, there has been increasing regulatory focus on ESG-related practices by investment managers. In 2023, the State of California passed two climate disclosure laws that will impose significant reporting obligations on companies doing business in California. Additionally, the SEC is poised in 2024 to issue a rule enhancing and standardizing climate disclosures by U.S. public companies, including investment managers. The SEC also has focused on the labeling by investment funds of their activities or investments as "sustainable" and has examined the methodology used by funds for determining ESG investments, with a keen focus on whether such labeling may be misleading. Outside the U.S., the European Commission has adopted an action plan on financing sustainable growth, as well as initiatives at the European Union (the " EU ") level, such as the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (the " SFDR "). Compliance with the SFDR and other ESG-related regulations may subject us to increased restrictions, disclosure obligations, and compliance and other associated costs, as well as potential reputational harm. 
 Also, in 2015 the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan (the FSC implemented new limits on the degree to which local investors can own an offshore investment product. While certain exemptions have been available to us, should we not continue to qualify, the FSC s rules could force some of our local resident investors to redeem their investments in our funds sold in Taiwan (and/or prevent further sales of those funds in Taiwan), some of which funds have local ownership levels substantially above the FSC limits. This could lead to significant declines in our investment advisory and services fees and revenues earned from these funds. 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings and regulatory matters and may be involved in such proceedings in the future, any one or combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
 We are involved in various matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which allege significant damages, and we may be involved in additional matters in the future. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages, the litigation is in its early stages, or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. 
 Structure-related Risks 
 The partnership structure of AB Holding and AB limits Unitholders abilities to influence the management and operation of AB s business and is highly likely to prevent a change in control of AB Holding and AB. 
 The General Partner, as general partner of both AB Holding and AB, generally has the exclusive right and full authority and responsibility to manage, conduct, control and operate their respective businesses, except as otherwise expressly stated in their respective Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership. AB Holding and AB Unitholders have more limited voting rights on matters affecting AB than do holders of common stock in a corporation. Both Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership provide that Unitholders do not have any right to vote for directors of the General Partner and that Unitholders only can vote on certain extraordinary matters (including removal of the General Partner under certain extraordinary circumstances). Additionally, the AB Partnership Agreement includes significant restrictions on the transfer of AB Units and provisions that have the practical effect of preventing the removal of the General Partner, which provisions are highly likely to prevent a change in control of AB s management. 
 AB Units are illiquid and subject to significant transfer restrictions. 
 There is no public trading market for AB Units and we do not anticipate that a public trading market will develop. The AB Partnership Agreement restricts our ability to participate in a public trading market or anything substantially equivalent to one by providing that any transfer that may cause AB to be classified as a publicly traded partnership PTP as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), shall be deemed void and shall not be recognized by AB. In addition, AB Units are subject to significant restrictions on transfer, such as obtaining the written consent of EQH and the General Partner pursuant to the AB Partnership Agreement. Generally, neither EQH nor the General Partner will permit any transfer that it believes would create a risk that AB would be treated as a corporation for tax purposes. EQH and the General Partner have implemented a transfer program that requires a seller to locate a purchaser and imposes annual volume restrictions on transfers. You may request a copy of the transfer program from our Corporate Secretary (corporate_secretary@alliancebernstein.com) . Also, we have filed the transfer program as Exhibit 10.07 to this Form 10-K. 
 Changes in the treatment of AB Holding and AB as partnerships for tax purposes would have significant tax ramifications. 
 Having elected under Section 7704(g) of the Code to be subject to a 3.5 federal tax on partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business, AB Holding is a PTP that is taxable as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. To preserve AB Holding's status as a PTP that is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, AB Holding must not directly or indirectly (through AB) enter into a substantial new line of business. A new line of business includes any business 
 2023 Annual Report 25 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 that is not closely related to AB s historical business of providing research and diversified investment management and related services to its clients. A new line of business is substantial when a partnership derives more than 15 of its gross income from, or uses more than 15 (by value) of its total assets in, the new line of business. 
 To preserve AB s status as a private partnership for federal income tax purposes, AB Units must not be considered publicly traded. 
 If either or both AB Holding and AB were taxable as a corporation, the return on investment to Unitholders generally would be reduced because distributions to Unitholders generally would be subject to two layers of taxation: first, amounts available for distribution would be subject to federal (and applicable state and local) taxes at the corporate entity level; and second, Unitholders generally would be subject to federal (and applicable state and local) taxes upon receipt of dividends. 
 AB Holding and AB are subject to the 4.0 New York City unincorporated business tax UBT ). AB Holding may net credits for UBT paid by AB. 
 Changes in tax law governing us or an increase in business activities outside the U.S. could have a material impact on us. 
 Legislative proposals have been or may be introduced that, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot predict the outcome of such legislative proposals. AB management continues to monitor and assess how any new legislation could affect AB. 
 Each of AB's non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries generally is subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdiction where it is located. If our business increasingly operates in countries other than the U.S., or if there are changes in tax law or rates of taxation in foreign jurisdictions where our corporate subsidiaries operate, AB's effective tax rate could increase. 
 If any audit by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of our income tax returns for any of our taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 results in any adjustments, the IRS may collect any resulting taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest, directly from us, in which case our net income and the cash available for quarterly Unitholder distributions may be substantially reduced. 
 For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a "partnership representative" that we designate (a Partnership Representative will have the sole authority to act on our behalf for purposes of, among other things, IRS audits and related proceedings (and any similar state or local audits and proceedings). Any actions taken by us or by the Partnership Representative on our behalf in connection with such audits or proceedings will be binding on us and our Unitholders. 
 For an audit of a partnership's taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the IRS, absent an election by the partnership to the contrary see discussion below ), generally determines adjustments at the partnership level in the year in which the audit is resolved. 
 Generally, we will have the ability to collect any resulting tax liability (and any related interest and penalties) from our Unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that we will elect to do so or be able to do so under all circumstances. If we do not collect such tax liability from our Unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests in the tax year under audit, our net income and the available cash for quarterly distributions to current Unitholders may be substantially reduced. Accordingly, our current Unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such Unitholders did not own Units during the tax year under audit. In particular, with respect to AB Holding, our Partnership Representative may, in certain instances, request that any imputed under-payment resulting from an audit be adjusted by amounts of certain of our passive losses. If we successfully make such a request, we would have to reduce suspended passive loss carryovers in a manner which is binding on the partners. 
 In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, we may, but are not required to, make an election to require our Unitholders to take into account on their income tax returns an audit adjustment made to our income tax items, also known as a push-out election. This may also require Unitholders to provide certain information to us (possibly including information about the beneficial owners of our Unitholders). Also, a partnership that is a partner of another partnership (such as AB Holding with respect to AB) may elect to have its unitholders take an audit adjustment of the lower-tier partnership into account (i.e., the upper-tier partnership may push adjustments received from the lower-tier partnership through to the partners of the upper-tier partnership). There are several requirements to make a push-out election and we may be unable or unwilling to comply with such requirements. If we do not make a push-out election, we would be required to pay any tax resulting from the adjustments to our income tax items, and the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced. 
 Non-U.S. unitholders may be subject to withholding tax on the sale of their AB Units or AB Holding Units, as well as on distributions, and we may be liable for any under-withholding. 
 Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership unit by a non-U.S. unitholder is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and is subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that the non-U.S. unitholder would have had effectively connected gain or loss on a hypothetical sale by the partnership of all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange of the partnership units. In furtherance of the foregoing, a transferee of a partnership unit is required to withhold a tax equal to 10 of the amount realized on any transfer of such a partnership unit unless an exception applies. 
 26 
 AllianceBernstein 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 Distributions by a PTP to a non-U.S. unitholder also are subject to U.S. withholding tax if the PTP has effectively connected gross income, gain or loss. 
 A transferee is not required to withhold tax if it relies on a certification issued by the transferor or the underlying partnership establishing that an exception to withholding applies. If a transferee of AB Units is required to withhold and failed to properly do so, AB would be required to withhold on distributions to the transferee to satisfy that liability. 
 A broker is not required to withhold on the transfer of an interest in a PTP or on a distribution by a PTP if the PTP certifies that the "10 exception" applies. This exception applies if, either (1) the PTP was not engaged in a U.S. trade or business during a specified time period, or (2) upon a hypothetical sale of the PTP's assets at fair market value, (i) the amount of net gain that would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. would be less than 10 of the total net gain, or (ii) no gain would have been effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. 
 To make this certification, the PTP must issue a "qualified notice" indicating that it qualifies for this exception, which we have done and intend to continue to do. The qualified notice must state the amount of a distribution that is attributable to each type of income group specified in the Treasury Regulations. The PTP must post each qualified notice on its primary public website (and keep it accessible for 10 years) and deliver it to any registered holder that is a nominee. A broker may not rely on such a certification if it has actual knowledge that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. 
 As a PTP, AB Holding may be liable for any under-withholding by a broker that relies on a qualified notice for which we failed to make a reasonable estimate of the amounts required for determining the applicability of the 10 exception. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 Neither AB nor AB Holding has unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report. 

Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 Cyber Risk Management and Strategy 
 We rely on digital technology to conduct our business operations and engage with our clients, business partners and employees. The technology that we, our clients, business partners and employees rely upon becomes more complex over time as do threats to our business operations from cyber intrusions, denial of service attacks, manipulation and other cyber misconduct. Information Security is an ongoing process of exercising the due care necessary to protect corporate, client and employee information and systems from unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, disruption and modification of use. 
 Through a combination of security, risk and compliance resources, AB implements Information Security through a dedicated Information Security Program (" ISP ") that is intended to identify, assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats and which includes a focus on safeguarding information and assets from cyber threats, engaging in cyber threat monitoring and responding to actual or potential cyber incidents. Our ISP is led by our Chief Information Security Officer (" CISO ") who actively partners with our Chief Compliance Officer (" CCO ") and Chief Risk Officer "(" CRO "). Ultimately, our ISP is part of our full enterprise risk framework, which includes information technology, business continuity and resiliency, in addition to cybersecurity risk. Our ISP is coordinated with our broader risk management team, including our Chief Security Officer. Enterprise risk, including cybersecurity risk, is overseen by the Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board. 
 Our CISO, with assistance from internal and external resources, is responsible for implementing and providing oversight of our ISP. The ISP employs a defense-in-depth strategy: an information assurance concept in which multiple layers of security controls are distributed throughout an operating environment. The concept manages risk with diverse defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defense fails, another later of defense will attempt to compensate. Our ISP features cybersecurity policies, standards and guidelines, committee governance, training, access controls and data controls. We periodically execute table top exercises as a part of our ISP program. 
 2023 Annual Report 27 

Table of Contents 
 Part I 

 Our ISP, together with our risk and compliance resources, proactively manage the risk of threat from cybersecurity incidents through (i) implementing protocols to take cybersecurity considerations into account in adopting and onboarding our technology resources, (ii) monitoring IT controls to better ensure compliance with cybersecurity and other related legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) assessing adherence by critical and material third parties we partner with to ensure that the appropriate risk management standards are met, (iv) ensuring essential business functions remain available during a business disruption, and (v) regularly developing and updating response plans to address potential IT or cyber incidents should they occur. Our security, risk and compliance resources are designed to prioritize IT and cybersecurity risk areas, identify solutions that minimize such risks, pursue optimal outcomes and maintain compliance standards. We also maintain an operational security function that has a real time response capability that triages potential incidents and triggers impact mitigation protocols. Additionally, we utilize third parties to conduct periodic cybersecurity assessments and our internal audit function includes certain cyber risk audits as part of its overall risk audit. We review the recommendations and findings from those assessments and audits and implement corrective and other measures as appropriate. Our cybersecurity processes rely predominantly on internal resources, but also include important third party resources for certain matters, including the aforementioned assessments as well as our continuous cybersecurity threat monitoring and initial incident reporting system. 
 As part of our ISP, we also perform cyber risk assessments on our critical and material third party vendors during onboarding, then periodically thereafter. 
 We have not had a cybersecurity incident that has materially affected, or was reasonably likely to, materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. There are risks from cybersecurity threats that if they were to occur could materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, including those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors - Operations, Technology and Cyber-Related Risks although we do not currently believe that such a result is reasonably likely. 
 Cyber Risk Governance 
 The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for assisting the Board with oversight of our enterprise risk framework, including cybersecurity, information security, information technology and business continuity and resiliency. Our CISO and other members of senior management including our General Counsel, CCO and CRO report quarterly to the Audit and Risk Committee at its regular meetings on the status of the Company's cybersecurity risk, risk management policies and risk assessment initiatives. the full Board is updated on an as needed basis. In the event of an immediate cyber threat to our business operations, our ISP would involve our General Counsel, who would promptly notify the Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee, as to the nature, timing and extent of the threat and our applicable contingency plans would go into effect. Our CRO, in collaboration with our CISO, is responsible for notifying the Audit and Risk Committee of world events or of other significant external events that may pose cybersecurity threats or material risks to our business continuity. 
 While our Board provides oversight of our cybersecurity risk environment, the ultimate responsibility for our processes for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks resides with management. Our CISO, with assistance from internal and external resources, is responsible for the implementation and providing oversight to our ISP within the organization and maintaining the appropriate level of expertise to manage and implement cybersecurity policies, programs and strategies. Our CISO has years of applied experience in actively managing cybersecurity and information security programs for large global publicly traded companies with complex and evolving information systems. Management oversight of our ISP is provided by various governance committees including the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, the Information Security Risk Oversight Subcommittee and the Financial Crimes Control Oversight Subcommittee. 
 
 Item 2. Properties 
 Our headquarters is located at 501 Commerce Street, Nashville, Tennessee. We occupy 218,976 square feet of space at this location under a 15-year lease agreement that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
 We lease space at our other principal location, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York pursuant to a lease expiring in 2024. At this location, we currently lease 999,963 square feet of space, within which we currently occupy approximately 512,284 square feet of space and have sub-let approximately 487,679 square feet of space. 
 Also, we entered into a 20-year lease agreement in New York, New York, at 66 Hudson Boulevard, for 166,015 square feet that commenced in January 2024. 
 We also lease 50,792 square feet of space in San Antonio, Texas under a lease expiring in 2029. 
 Additionally, we lease 100,000 square feet of space in Pune, India under a lease expiring in 2033. 
 We lease more modest amounts of space in 27 other cities in the United States.

 Our subsidiaries lease space in 32 cities outside the United States, the most significant of which is a lease in London, England, expiring in 2031, and in Hong Kong, China, under a lease expiring in 2027. In London we currently lease 60,732 square feet of space. In Hong Kong, we currently lease and occupy 35,878 square feet of space. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 With respect to all significant litigation matters, we consider the likelihood of a negative outcome. If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses for such matters, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of losses. However, it is often difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages. Such is particularly the case when the litigation is in its early stages or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. In these cases, we disclose that we are unable to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss. As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to our significant litigation matters. 
 On December 14, 2022, four individual participants in the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of AB (the " AB Profit Sharing Plan" filed a class action complaint (the " Complaint ") in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AB, current and former members of the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee of the Board of Directors, and the Investment and Administrative Committees under the AB Profit Sharing Plan. Plaintiffs, who seek to represent a class of all participants in the AB Profit Sharing Plan from December 14, 2016 to the present, allege that defendants violated their fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions under ERISA by including proprietary collective investment trusts as investment options offered in the AB Profit Sharing Plan. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and other equitable relief. AB is prepared to defend itself vigorously against these claims and filed a motion to dismiss on February 24, 2023. While the outcome of this matter currently is not determinable given the matter remains in its early stages, we do not believe this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 AB may be involved in various other matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which may allege significant damages. It is reasonably possible that we could incur losses pertaining to these matters, but we cannot currently estimate any such losses. 
 Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently believes that the outcome of any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, any inquiry, proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty; management cannot determine whether further developments relating to any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period.

 AB Holding Units are listed on the NYSE and trade publicly under the ticker symbol AB . There is no established public trading market for AB Units, which are subject to significant restrictions on transfer. For information about these transfer restrictions, see Structure-related Risks in Item 1A . 
 AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its limited partnership interests in AB. 
 Each of AB Holding and AB distributes on a quarterly basis all of its Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Holding Partnership Agreement and the AB Partnership Agreement, respectively, to its Unitholders and the General Partner.

For additional information concerning distribution of Available Cash Flow by AB, see Note 2 to AB s consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 On December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of the year), the closing price of an AB Holding Unit on the NYSE was 31.03 per Unit. On December 31, 2023, there were (i) 871 AB Holding Unitholders of record for approximately 112,000 beneficial owners, and (ii) 359 AB Unitholders of record (we do not believe there are substantial additional beneficial owners). 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities 
 We did not engage in any unregistered sales of our securities during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, except as previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 1, 2022 in connection with the acquisition of CarVal Investors L.P. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 Each quarter, AB considers whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. We did not adopt a plan during the fourth quarter of 2023. AB may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under the firm s incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes.

 Our total Assets Under Management (" AUM ") as of December 31, 2023 were 725.2 billion, up 78.8 billion, or 12.2 , during 2023. The increase was driven by market appreciation of 85.8 billion, offset by net outflows of 7.0 billion (reflecting Institutional net outflows of 11.8 billion, offset by Retail net inflows of 3.7 billion and Private Wealth Management net inflows of 1.1 billion). 
 Institutional AUM increased 19.8 billion, or 6.7 , to 317.1 billion during 2023, primarily due to market appreciation of 31.5 billion, partially offset by net outflows of 11.8 billion. Gross sales decreased 20.4 billion, from 32.2 billion in 2022 to 11.8 billion in 2023. Redemptions and terminations decreased 0.7 billion, from 13.3 billion in 2022 to 12.6 billion in 2023. 
 Retail AUM increased 43.9 billion, or 18.1 , to 286.8 billion during 2023, primarily due to market appreciation of 40.3 billion and net inflows of 3.7 billion. Gross sales increased 5.2 billion, from 65.9 billion in 2022 to 71.1 billion in 2023. Redemptions and terminations decreased 8.2 billion, from 66.3 billion in 2022 to 58.1 billion in 2023. 
 Private Wealth Management AUM increased 15.1 billion, or 14.1 , to 121.3 billion during 2023, due to market appreciation of 14.0 billion and net inflows of 1.1 billion. Gross sales increased 1.1 billion, from 17.5 billion in 2022 to 18.6 billion in 2023. Redemptions and terminations increased 1.7 billion, from 15.8 billion in 2022 to 17.5 billion in 2023. 
 Bernstein Research Services (" BRS ") revenue decreased 30.1 million, or 7.2 , in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower global customer trading activity due to the prevailing macro-economic environment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AB and Soci t G n rale (EURONEXT: GLE, SocGen ), a leading European bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As a result, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 Our 2023 net revenues of 4.2 billion increased 101.0 million, or 2.5 , compared to net revenues of 4.1 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by investment gains in the current year compared to investment losses in the prior year (impact of 116.6 million), higher net dividend and interest income of 35.2 million and higher base advisory fees of 4.8 million, partially offset by lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of 30.1 million and lower distribution revenues of 20.9 million. 
 Our operating expenses of 3.3 billion increased 98.5 million, or 3.0 , compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expenses of 102.5 million, higher interest on borrowings of 36.5 million, higher amortization of intangibles of 20.3 million and higher contingent payment arrangements of 16.3 million, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses of 60.1 million and lower promotion and servicing expenses of 17.1 million. Our operating income increased 2.6 million, or 0.3 , to 817.7 million from 815.1 million in 2022 and our operating margin decreased to 19.1 in 2023 from 21.5 in 2022. 
 Market Environment 
 U.S. Equities 
 U.S. Equity markets registered strong gains in the final quarter of 2023, buoyed by slowing inflation data and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve (the " Fed ") has finished its rate hiking cycle and will move towards cuts in 2024. Market breadth improved in the fourth quarter, with share price appreciation moving beyond mega-cap technology stocks. Both the cap-weighted S P 500 and the equal-weighted S P 500 returned positive 12 in the fourth quarter (including dividends). Previously lagging segments of the market rebounded, with Small-Caps (market capitalization ranges between 250 million to 2 billion) and Mid-Caps (market capitalization ranges between 2 billion to 10 billion) outperforming Large-Caps (market capitalization above 10 billion) with the Russell 2000 index posting a positive 14 return in the fourth quarter and Value stocks outperforming Growth stocks in the fourth quarter.

 Despite the broadening rally in late 2023, annual index returns were largely concentrated within the "Magnificent-7" companies: a term coined for Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla which were perceived as the main beneficiaries of the Artificial Intelligence revolution. These seven companies boast the largest market capitalization values in the S P 500 and account for more than a quarter of the index, disproportionally driving the capitalization-weighted S P 500's 2023 total return of positive 26 versus positive 14 for the equal-weighted version. 
 Global and Non-U.S. Equities 
 Moderating inflation data and peaking interest rates drove nearly unilateral gains beyond U.S. equity markets (MSCI World Index was positive 11.4 in the fourth quarter). Within the Eurozone, annual inflation fell to 2.4 (as of November 2023) from 10.1 a year ago, sending the MSCI European Economic and Monetary Union index 7.8 higher in the fourth quarter. In the U.K., gains were led by Small-Cap and Mid-Cap indices while Large-Cap lagged on account of a strengthening GBP (sterling). Japan's TOPIX trading index posted a positive 2.0 total return despite a volatile quarter and overall Emerging Market equities were strong in the fourth quarter, albeit lagging Developed Markets. All markets in the MSCI Asia (ex Japan) index ended the quarter positively, apart from China, where lackluster growth continues to be a drag on asset prices. 
 Global Bonds 
 Fixed income markets experienced their strongest quarterly performance in over 20 years, as indicated by the Bloomberg Global Aggregate indices. This was primarily driven by a perceived shift in monetary policy direction, with expectations of rate cuts replacing the previous "higher-for-longer" narrative. As a result, government bond yields fell significantly, and credit markets outperformed government bonds. The Fed maintained its rates throughout the quarter, but a more dovish tone in December accelerated the market rally. The revised dot plot, which plots the Federal Open Market Committee's (" FOMC ") projections for the federal funds rate, now anticipates three rate cuts in 2024, up from the previous expectation of two. The FOMC appears more comfortable with the progress made in bringing inflation back towards the target, as indicated by positive news on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which is the Fed's most closely watched measure. 
 Relationship with EQH and its Subsidiaries 
 EQH (our parent company) and its subsidiaries are our largest client. EQH is collaborating with AB in order to improve the risk-adjusted yield for the General Accounts of EQH's insurance subsidiaries by investing additional assets at AB, including the utilization of AB's higher-fee, longer-duration alternative offerings. In mid-2021, Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of EQH (" Equitable Financial "), agreed to provide an initial 10 billion in permanent capital to build out AB's private illiquid offerings, including private alternatives and private placements. Deployment of this capital commitment is approximately 90 completed and is expected to continue over the next year. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, EQH committed to provide an additional 10 billion in permanent capital, which will begin following the completion of the initial 10 billion commitment. We expect this anticipated capital from Equitable Financial will continue to accelerate both organic and inorganic growth in our private alternatives business, allowing us to continue to deliver for our clients, employees, unitholders and other stakeholders. For example, included in the initial 10 billion commitment by EQH is 750 million in capital to be deployed through AB CarVal. 
 Permanent capital means investment capital of indefinite duration, for which commitments may be withdrawn under certain conditions. Such conditions primarily include potential regulatory restrictions, lacking sufficient liquidity to fund the capital commitments to AB and AB's inability to identify attractive investment opportunities which align with the investment strategy. Although EQH s insurance subsidiaries have indicated their intention over time to provide this investment capital to AB, they have no binding commitment to do so. While the withdrawal of their commitment could potentially slow down our introduction of certain products, the impact to our overall operations would not be material. 
 Relocation Strategy 
 As previously announced, we have established our corporate headquarters in Nashville, TN, at 501 Commerce Street. Our Nashville headquarters houses Finance, IT, Operations, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, Human Capital, and Sales and Marketing, and at year-end 2023 we had 1,048 employees in Nashville. We will continue to maintain a principal location in New York City, which houses our Portfolio Management, Sell-Side Research and Trading, and New York-based Private Wealth Management businesses. 
 We believe relocating our corporate headquarters to Nashville affords us the opportunity to provide an improved quality of life alternative for our employees and enables us to attract and recruit new talented employees to a highly desirable location while improving the long-term cost structure of the firm. 
 During the transition period, which began in 2018 and is expected to continue through 2024, we currently estimate that we will incur transition costs of between 145 million to 155 million. These costs include employee relocation, severance, recruitment, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. Over this same period, we expect to realize total expense savings of between 205 million to 215 million. However, we did incur some transition costs before we began to realize expense savings. For the period beginning in 2018 and ending in the fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred 140 million of cumulative transition costs compared to 175 million of cumulative savings. We incurred 20 million of transition costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 43 million of expense savings, resulting in an overall net savings of 
 2023 Annual Report 33

 23 million for the period. In 2023, our net income per unit (" EPU ") increased 0.08 as a result of our relocation strategy, which compares to the 0.07 EPU increase that occurred in 2022. We also expect to achieve EPU accretion in each future year. Beginning in 2025, once the transition period has been completed, we estimate ongoing annual expense savings of approximately 75 million, which will result from a combination of occupancy and compensation-related savings. Our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings are based on our current assumptions of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs. In addition, our estimates for both the timing of when we incur transition costs and realize the related expense savings are based on our current relocation implementation plan and the timing for execution of each phase. The actual total charges we eventually record, the related expense savings we realize, and the timing of EPU impact may differ from our current estimates as we implement each phase of our headquarters relocation. 
 During October 2018, we signed a lease, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020, relating to 218,976 square feet of space at our new Nashville headquarters. Our estimated total base rent obligation (excluding taxes, operating expenses and utilities) over the 15-year initial lease term is 134 million. 
 Although we have presented many of our transition costs and annual expense savings with numerical specificity, and we believe these targets to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions we discuss above create a significant risk that these targets may not be achieved. Accordingly, the expenses we actually incur and the savings we actually realize may differ from our targets, particularly if actual events adversely differ from one or more of our key assumptions. The transition costs and expense savings, together with their underlying assumptions, are Forward-Looking Statements and can be affected by any of the factors discussed in Risk Factors and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this 2023 10-K. We strongly caution investors not to place undue reliance on any of these assumptions or our cost and expense targets. Except as may be required by applicable securities laws, we are not under any obligation, and we expressly disclaim any obligation, to update or alter any assumptions, estimates, financial goals, targets, projections or other related statements that we may make.

 During 2023, our Retail channel average AUM of 262.0 billion decreased 5.8 billion, or 2.1 , compared to 2022, while ending AUM increased 43.9 billion, or 18.1 , to 286.8 billion from December 31, 2022. The 43.9 billion increase in AUM resulted primarily from market appreciation of 40.3 billion (with 26.3 billion of market appreciation occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023) and net inflows of 3.7 billion. During 2022, our Retail channel average AUM of 267.8 billion decreased 23.2 billion, or 8.0 , compared to 2021, primarily due to this AUM decreasing 77.0 billion, or 24.1 , to 242.9 billion from December 31, 2021. The 77.0 billion decrease in AUM resulted primarily from market depreciation of 65.5 billion and net outflows of 11.6 billion. 
 During 2023, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of 113.7 billion increased 3.4 billion, or 3.0 , compared to 2022, primarily due to this AUM increasing 15.1 billion, or 14.1 , to 121.3 billion from December 31, 2022. The 15.1 billion increase in AUM resulted from market appreciation of 14.0 billion (with 9.0 billion of market appreciation occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023) and net inflows of 1.1 billion. During 2022, our Private Wealth Management channel average AUM of 110.3 billion decreased 3.8 billion, or 3.3 , compared to 2021, primarily due to this AUM decreasing 15.4 billion, or 12.6 , to 106.2 billion from December 31, 2021. The 15.4 billion decrease in AUM resulted from market depreciation of 17.1 billion, offset by net inflows of 1.7 billion.

 Net income attributable to AB Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased 316.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease primarily was due to (in millions): 
 Lower base advisory fees (123.6) Higher investment losses (101.8) Lower performance-based fees (99.9) Higher general and administrative expenses (86.0) Lower distribution revenues (45.0) Lower Bernstein Research Services revenue (35.7) Lower promotion and servicing expenses 60.1 Higher net loss of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interest 61.5 Lower employee compensation and benefits 49.4 Other 4.2 (316.8) 
 Units Outstanding 
 
 Each quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC, as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. There was no plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2023. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes. 
 Cash Distributions 
 
 We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow, as defined in the AB Partnership Agreement, to our Unitholders and the General Partner. Available Cash Flow typically is the adjusted diluted net income per unit for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. In future periods, management anticipates that Available Cash Flow will continue to be based on adjusted diluted net income per unit, unless management determines, with concurrence of the Board of Directors, that one or more adjustments that are made for adjusted net income should not be made with respect to the Available Cash Flow calculation. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for a description of Available Cash Flow. 
 Management Operating Metrics 
 
 We are providing the non-GAAP measures adjusted net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because they are the principal operating metrics management uses in evaluating and comparing period-to-period operating performance. Management principally uses these metrics in evaluating performance because they present a clearer picture of our operating performance and allow management to see long-term trends without the distortion primarily caused by long-term incentive compensation-related mark-to-market adjustments, acquisition-related expenses, interest expense and other adjustment items. Similarly, we believe that these management operating metrics help investors better understand the underlying trends in our results and, accordingly, provide a valuable perspective for investors. 
 These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as substitutes for, net revenues, operating income and operating margin, and they may not be comparable to non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Management uses both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (" US GAAP ") and non-GAAP measures in evaluating our financial performance. The non-GAAP measures alone may pose limitations because they do not include all of our revenues and expenses.

 1 During the second quarter of 2023, we revised adjusted operating income to exclude interest on borrowings in order to align with our industry peer group. We have recast prior periods presentation to align with the current period presentation. 
 Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 13.9 million, or 1.4 , from the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits expense of 39.3 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of 30.1 million, lower investment advisory base fees of 25.1 million and higher general and administrative expenses of 6.2 million, partially offset by higher net dividend and interest income of 51.6 million and higher performance-based fees of 35.5 million. 
 Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased 254.4 million, or 20.9 , from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower performance-based fees of 130.9 million, lower investment advisory base fees of 99.1 million, lower Bernstein Research Services revenue of 35.7 million and higher general and administrative expenses of 32.3 million, partially offset by lower employee compensation and benefits expense of 58.4 million.

 Adjusted Net Revenues 
 Net Revenue, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution revenues, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory services fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on the distinct arrangements, certain distribution fees are collected by us and passed through to third-party client intermediaries, while for certain other products, we collect investment advisory services fees and a portion is passed through to third-party client intermediaries. In both arrangements, the third-party client intermediary owns the relationship with the client and is responsible for performing services and distributing the product to the client on our behalf. We believe offsetting distribution revenues and certain investment advisory services fees is useful for our investors and other users of our financial statements because such presentation appropriately reflects the nature of these costs as pass-through payments to third parties that perform functions on behalf of our sponsored mutual funds and/or shareholders of these funds. Distribution-related adjustments fluctuate each period based on the type of investment products sold, as well as the average AUM over the period. Also, we adjust distribution revenues for the amortization of deferred sales commissions as these costs, over time, will offset such revenues. 
 We adjust investment advisory and services fees and other revenues for pass through costs, primarily related to our transfer agent and shareholder servicing fees. Also, we adjust for certain performance-based fees passed through to our investment advisors. These fees do not affect operating income, as such, we exclude these fees from adjusted net revenues. 
 We adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds' revenues and including AB's fees from such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and AB's investment gains and losses on its investments in such consolidated company-sponsored investment funds that were eliminated in consolidation. 
 Adjusted net revenues exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. Also, we adjust for certain acquisition-related pass-through performance-based fees and performance related compensation. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2021, we wrote down an equity method investment; this write-down brought the investment balance to zero. 
 
 Adjusted Operating Income 
 Adjusted operating income represents operating income on a US GAAP basis excluding (1) real estate charges (credits), (2) the impact on net revenues and compensation expense of the investment gains and losses (as well as the dividends and interest) associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (3) the equity compensation paid by EQH to certain AB executives, as discussed below , (4) the write-down of investments discussed immediately above ), (5) acquisition-related expenses, (6) interest on borrowings and (7) the impact of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. 
 Real estate charges (credits) incurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2020, while excluded in the period in which the charges (credits) were recorded, are included ratably over the remaining applicable lease term. 
 Prior to 2009, a significant portion of employee compensation was in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards that were notionally invested in AB investment services and generally vested over a period of four years. AB economically hedged the exposure to market movements by purchasing and holding these investments on its balance sheet. All such investments had vested as of year-end 2012 and the investments have been delivered to the participants, except for those investments with respect to which the participant elected a long-term deferral. Fluctuation in the value of these investments, which also impacts compensation expense, is recorded within investment gains and losses on the income statement. Management believes it is useful to reflect the offset achieved from economically hedging the market exposure of these investments in the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The non-GAAP measures exclude gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments included in revenues and compensation expense. 
 The board of directors of EQH granted to Seth Bernstein, our CEO, equity awards in connection with EQH's IPO. Additionally, equity awards were granted to Mr. Bernstein and other AB executives for their membership on the EQH Management Committee. These individuals may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to their service on the Management Committee. Any awards granted to these individuals by EQH are recorded as compensation expense in AB s consolidated statement of income. The compensation expense associated with these awards has been excluded from our non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash and are based upon EQH's, and not AB's, financial performance.

 The write-down of investments discussed above in Adjusted Net Revenues have been excluded due to their non-recurring nature and because they are not part of our core operating results. 
 Acquisition-related expenses have been excluded because they are not considered part of our core operating results when comparing financial results from period to period and to industry peers. Acquisition-related expenses include professional fees and the recording of changes in estimates to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, acquisition-related expenses also include certain compensation-related expenses, amortization of intangible assets for contracts acquired and accretion expense with respect to contingent payment arrangements. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, acquisition related expenses included an intangible asset impairment charge of zero, 5.6 million and 1.0 million, respectively, related to various historical acquisitions. 
 The recording of changes in estimates of contingent consideration payable with respect to contingent payment arrangements associated with our acquisitions are not considered part of our core operating results and, accordingly, have been excluded. During 2023, we recorded an expense of 28.4 million due to a change in estimate related to the contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Autonomous LLC in 2019. The change in estimate was based upon better than expected revenues during the 2023 performance evaluation period. We recorded 14.1 million as contingent payment arrangement expense and 14.3 million as compensation and benefits expense in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The charges to compensation and benefits expense are due to certain service conditions and special awards included in the acquisition agreement. 
 We adjust operating income to exclude interest on borrowings in order to align with our industry peer group. 
 We adjusted for the operating income impact of consolidating certain company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored funds' revenues and expenses and including AB's revenues and expenses that were eliminated in consolidation. We also excluded the limited partner interests we do not own. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Net Income per AB Unit 
 As previously discussed , our quarterly distribution is typically our adjusted diluted net income per unit (which is derived from adjusted net income) for the quarter multiplied by the number of general and limited partnership interests at the end of the quarter. Adjusted income taxes, used in calculating adjusted net income, are calculated using the GAAP effective tax rate adjusted for non-GAAP income tax adjustments. 
 Adjusted Operating Margin 
 Adjusted operating margin allows us to monitor our financial performance and efficiency from period to period without the volatility noted above in our discussion of adjusted operating income and to compare our performance to industry peers on a basis that better reflects our performance in our core business. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenues.

 Investment Advisory and Services Fees 
 Investment advisory and services fees are the largest component of our revenues. These fees generally are calculated as a percentage of the value of AUM as of a specified date, or as a percentage of the value of average AUM for the applicable billing period, and vary with the type of investment service, the size of account and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client. Accordingly, fee income generally increases or decreases as AUM increase or decrease and is affected by market appreciation or depreciation, the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts, withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts, purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares, shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures, and acquisitions. Our average basis points realized (investment advisory and services fees divided by average AUM) generally approximate 30 to 105 basis points for actively managed equity services, 10 to 65 basis points for actively-managed fixed income services and 1 to 50 basis points for passively managed services. Average basis points realized for other services could range from 3 basis points for certain Institutional third party managed services to over 190 basis points for certain Retail and Private Wealth Management alternative services. These ranges include all-inclusive fee arrangements (covering investment management, trade execution and other services) for our Private Wealth Management clients. 
 We calculate AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Market-based valuation methods include: last sale/settle prices from an exchange for actively-traded listed equities, options and futures; evaluated bid prices from recognized pricing vendors for fixed income, asset-backed or mortgage-backed issues; mid prices from recognized pricing vendors and brokers for credit default swaps; and quoted bids or spreads from pricing 
 46

 Part II 

 vendors and brokers for other derivative products. Fair valuation methods include: discounted cash flow models or any other methodology that is validated and approved by our Valuation Committee and sub-committee (the " Valuation Committee" ( see paragraph immediately below for more information regarding our Valuation Committee). Fair valuation methods are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities. 
 The Valuation Committee, consists of senior officers and employees, which oversees a consistent framework of pricing and valuation of all investments held in client and AB portfolios. The Valuation Committee has adopted a Statement of Pricing Policies describing principles and policies that apply to pricing and valuing investments held in these portfolios. We also have a Pricing Group, which is overseen by the Valuation Committee and is responsible for managing the pricing process for all investments. 
 We sometimes charge our clients performance-based fees. In these situations, we charge a base advisory fee and are eligible to earn an additional performance-based fee or incentive allocation that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. Some performance-based fees include a high-watermark provision, which generally provides that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target (whether absolute or relative to a specified benchmark), it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees. Therefore, if we fail to achieve our performance target for a particular period, we will not earn a performance-based fee for that period and, for accounts with a high-watermark provision, our ability to earn future performance-based fees will be impaired. We are eligible to earn performance-based fees on 9.3 , 8.3 and 0.4 of the assets we manage for institutional clients, private wealth clients and retail clients, respectively (in total, 5.6 of our AUM). 
 Our investment advisory and services fees increased by 4.4 million, or 0.1 , in 2023, due to a 4.8 million, or 0.2 , increase in base fees, offset by a 0.3 million decrease in performance-based fees. The increase in base fees is primarily due to slight shift in product mix to alternatives, which generally earn higher fees, partially offset by a 0.9 decrease in average AUM. Our investment advisory and services fees decreased by 223.5 million, or 7.0 , in 2022, due to a 123.6 million, or 4.2 , decrease in base fees and a 99.9 million decrease in performance-based fees. The decrease in base fees was primarily due to a 6.1 decrease in average AUM, partially offset by a slight increase in our portfolio fee rate. 
 Performance-based fees decreased 0.3 million, or 0.2 , in 2023, primarily due to lower performance-based fees earned on U.S. Real Estate fund and Emerging Markets Opportunistic Credit fund, partially offset by higher performance-based fees earned on Private Credit fund, Global Opportunistic Credit fund, Global Multi-Strategy fund and Securitized Assets fund. Performance-based fees decreased 99.9 million, or 40.7 , in 2022, primarily due to lower performance-based fees earned on Financial Services Opportunities fund, U.S. Select Equity fund, Arya Partners fund and Private Credit Services fund, partially offset by higher U.S. Real Estate fund fees. 
 Institutional base fees increased 30.4 million, or 5.2 , in 2023, primarily due to a higher portfolio fee rate, partially offset by a 1.2 decrease in average AUM. Retail base fees decreased 45.7 million, or 3.5 , in 2023, primarily due to a 2.1 decrease in average AUM. Private Wealth base fees increased 20.1 million, or 2.2 , in 2023, primarily due to a 3.0 increase in average AUM. Institutional base fees increased 41.5 million, or 7.7 , in 2022, primarily due to a higher portfolio fee rate, partially offset by a 5.3 decrease in average AUM. Retail base fees decreased 120.5 million, or 8.4 , in 2022, primarily due to an 8.0 decrease in average AUM. Private Wealth base fees decreased 44.6 million, or 4.6 , in 2022, primarily due to a 3.3 decrease in average AUM. 
 
 Bernstein Research Services 
 We earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser extent, but increasingly, by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AB and SocGen, a leading European bank, announced plans to form a joint venture combining their respective cash equities and research businesses. As a result, the BRS business has been classified as held for sale. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased 30.1 million, or 7.2 , in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower global customer trading activity due to the prevailing macro-economic environment. 
 Revenues from Bernstein Research Services decreased 35.7 million, or 7.9 , in 2022. The decrease was driven by significantly lower customer trading activity in Europe and Asia due to local market conditions. 
 
 Distribution Revenues 
 Two of our subsidiaries act as distributors and/or placement agents of company-sponsored mutual funds and receive distribution services fees from certain of those funds as full or partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses they incur. Period-over-period fluctuations of distribution revenues typically are in line with fluctuations of the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds. 
 2023 Annual Report 47 

Table of Contents 
 Part II 

 Distribution revenues decreased 20.9 million, or 3.4 , in 2023, primarily due to a shift in product mix from mutual funds with higher distribution rates to mutual funds with lower distribution rates, as well as a 1.4 decrease in the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds. Distribution revenues decreased 45.0 million, or 6.9 , in 2022, primarily due to the corresponding average AUM of these mutual funds decreasing 12.4 , partially offset by a shift in product mix from mutual funds with lower distribution rates to mutual funds with higher distribution rates. 
 
 Dividend and Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 Dividend and interest income consists primarily of investment income and interest earned on customer margin balances and U.S. Treasury Bills as well as dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense principally reflects interest accrued on cash balances in customers brokerage accounts. 
 Dividend and interest income increased 76.4 million, or 62.0 , in 2023, primarily due to higher interest earned on customer margin balances and higher interest earned on U.S. Treasury Bills. Interest expense increased 41.1 million in 2023, due to higher interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts. 
 Dividend and interest income increased 84.4 million in 2022, primarily due to higher interest earned on customer margin balances, higher interest earned on U.S. Treasury Bills as well as higher dividend and interest income in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Interest expense increased 62.8 million, in 2022, due to higher interest paid on cash balances in customers' brokerage accounts.

 Investment gains (losses) consist primarily of realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on: (i) employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments, (ii) U.S. Treasury Bills, (iii) market-making in exchange-traded options and equities, (iv) seed capital investments, (v) derivatives and (vi) investments in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. Investment gains (losses) also include equity in earnings of proprietary investments in limited partnership hedge funds that we sponsor and manage. 
 Investment gains (losses) are as follows: 
 Years Ended December 31 2023 2022 2021 (in thousands) Long-term incentive compensation-related investments: Realized gains 6,573 1,345 2,213 Unrealized (losses) gains (1,707) (10,626) 2,446 Investments held by consolidated company-sponsored investment funds: Realized (losses) (32,125) (46,293) (2,341) Unrealized gains (losses) 48,350 (73,194) (1,882) Seed capital investments: Realized (losses) gains Seed capital and other (34) 17,272 20,263 Derivatives (7,588) 41,236 (22,313) Unrealized gains (losses) Seed capital and other 10,099 (31,261) (6,907) Derivatives (8,717) (177) 8,992 Brokerage-related investments: Realized (losses) (203) (1,384) (829) Unrealized (losses) gains (442) 669 (278) 14,206 (102,413) (636) 
 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues consist of fees earned for transfer agency services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds, fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to company-sponsored mutual funds and the General Accounts of EQH and its subsidiaries, and other miscellaneous revenues. Other revenues decreased 4.2 million, or 4.0 , in 2023, primarily due to lower shareholder servicing fees and lower brokerage income, partially offset by higher mutual fund reimbursements. Other revenues decreased 2.9 million, or 2.6 , in 2022, primarily due to lower shareholder servicing fees.

 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits consist of base compensation (including salaries and severance), annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), annual long-term incentive compensation awards, commissions, fringe benefits and other employment costs (including recruitment, training, temporary help and meals). 
 Compensation expense as a percentage of net revenues was 42.6 , 41.1 and 38.6 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Compensation expense generally is determined on a discretionary basis and is primarily a function of our firm s current-year financial performance. The amounts of incentive compensation we award are designed to motivate, reward and retain top talent while aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our Unitholders. Senior management, together with the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee of the Board of Directors of AllianceBernstein Corporation Compensation Committee ), continue to believe that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues. Adjusted net revenues used in the adjusted compensation ratio are the same as the adjusted net revenues presented as a non-GAAP measure discussed earlier in this Item 7 ). Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals (which were 1.1 , 1.1 and 0.9 of adjusted net revenues for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively), and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments and the amortization expense associated with the awards issued by EQH to some of our firm's executives relating to their roles as members of the EQH Management Committee. Senior management, with the approval of the Compensation Committee, has established as an objective that adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense, excluding the impact of performance-based fees, generally should not exceed 50 of our adjusted net revenues in any year, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. Our ratios of adjusted compensation expense as a percentage of adjusted net revenues were 49.0 , 48.4 and 46.5 , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 
 In 2023, employee compensation and benefits expense increased 102.5 million, or 6.2 , primarily due to higher base compensation of 72.2 million, higher incentive compensation of 51.7 million and higher fringes of 7.8 million, partially offset by lower commissions of 29.0 million. In 2022, employee compensation and benefits expense decreased 49.4 million, or 2.9 , primarily due to lower incentive compensation of 107.7 million, partially offset by higher base compensation of 39.8 million, higher commissions of 12.7 million and higher other employment costs of 5.3 million. 
 
 Promotion and Servicing 
 Promotion and servicing expenses include distribution-related payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of AB mutual funds and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back-end load shares of AB mutual funds. Also included in this expense category are costs related to trade execution and clearance, travel and entertainment, advertising and promotional materials.

 Part II 

 Promotion and servicing expenses decreased 17.1 million, or 1.9 , in 2023. The decrease was due to lower distribution-related payments of 19.2 million, lower trade execution and clearance expenses of 9.0 million and lower transfer fees of 3.0 million, offset by higher travel and entertainment expenses of 8.5 million, higher marketing and communication expenses of 3.5 million and higher amortization of deferred sales commissions of 2.1 million. Promotion and servicing expenses decreased 60.1 million, or 6.4 , in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower distribution-related payments of 78.5 million, lower transfer fees of 4.9 million and lower trade execution and clearance expenses of 3.1 million, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment expenses of 15.4 million and higher firm meeting expenses of 8.8 million. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses include portfolio services fees, technology fees, professional fees and office-related expenses (occupancy, communications and similar expenses). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 14.0 , 15.8 and 12.5 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased 60.1 million, or 9.4 , in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower portfolio services fees of 43.7 million, lower professional fees of 18.0 million, lower valuation adjustments related to the classification of Bernstein Research Services as held for sale of 6.0 million and a favorable foreign exchange translation impact of 5.7 million, partially offset by higher office-related expenses of 7.4 million. General and administrative expenses increased 86.0 million, or 15.5 , in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees of 27.3 million, higher portfolio services fees of 21.3 million, higher technology fees of 19.1 million, a valuation adjustment of 7.4 million associated with the classification of BRS as held for sale, higher office-related expenses of 6.9 million and a 5.6 million impairment of certain acquisition related intangible assets. 
 
 Contingent Payment Arrangements 
 Contingent payment arrangements reflect changes in estimates of contingent payment liabilities associated with acquisitions in current and previous periods, as well as accretion expense of these liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized 8.8 million, 6.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, in accretion expense related to our contingent considerations payable. During 2023, we recorded a change in estimate related to the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of Autonomous LLC in 2019 of 14.1 million. The change in estimate was based upon better than expected revenues during the 2023 performance evaluation period. There were no changes in our estimates during the year ended December 31, 2022. During 2021, we recorded a change in estimate related to the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC of 0.6 million. Due to the loss of acquired investment management contracts, the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible assets exceeded the fair value of the contracts. These expenses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within contingent payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of income. 
 Interest on Borrowings 
 Interest expense increased 36.5 million in 2023, reflecting higher interest rates on borrowings and higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for the EQH facilities and commercial paper were 1,014 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.1 during 2023 compared to 845.5 million and 1.7 during 2022. 
 Interest expense increased 12.8 million in 2022, reflecting higher interest rates on borrowings and higher weighted average borrowings. Average daily borrowings for the EQH facilities and commercial paper were 845.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.7 during 2022 compared to 561.6 million and 0.2 during 2021. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets reflects our amortization of costs assigned to acquired investment management contracts with a finite life. These assets are recognized at fair value and generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. On July 1, 2022, AB acquired CarVal Investors L.P. ("CarVal"), which resulted in recording of 303.0 million of finite-lived intangible assets primarily relating to investment management contracts and investor relationships with useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ). Amortization of intangible assets increased 20.3 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to the acquired intangible assets associated with the CarVal acquisition. Amortization of intangible assets increased 20.9 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the acquired intangible assets associated with the CarVal acquisition. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 AB, a private limited partnership, is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes. However, AB is subject to a 4.0 New York City unincorporated business tax UBT ). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located.

 Part II 

 Income tax expense decreased 10.6 million, or 26.7 , in 2023 compared to 2022. This decrease is primarily driven by a one time tax benefit of 22.4 million resulting from the release of a valuation allowance on a capital loss tax asset due to a tax planning action identified in the fourth quarter of 2023, due to a future restructuring of certain foreign subsidiaries that would not have a material impact on AB operations. This resulted in a lower effective tax rate in 2023 of 3.6 compared to 4.9 in 2022. 
 Income tax expense decreased 23.1 million, or 36.8 , in 2022 compared to 2021. This decrease is due to lower pre-tax book income and one-time discrete items which resulted in a lower effective tax rate in 2022 of 4.9 compared to 5.2 in 2021. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) of Consolidated Entities Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests 
 Net income (loss) of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests primarily consists of limited partner interests owned by other investors in our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2023, we had 24.0 million of net income of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2022, we had 56.4 million of net loss of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to losses on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. In 2021 we had 5.1 million of net income of consolidated entities attributable to non-controlling interests, primarily due to gains on investments held by our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds. 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Cash flows from operating activities primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and services fees and other revenues offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been positive and sufficient to support our operations. We do not anticipate this to change in the foreseeable future. Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of small capital expenditures and, when applicable, business acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of issuance and repayment of debt and the repurchase of AB Holding units to fund our long-term deferred compensation plans. We are required to distribute all of our Available Cash Flow to our Unitholders and the General Partner. 
 During 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 0.9 billion, compared to 1.1 billion during 2022. The change primarily was due to an increase in fees receivable of 161.1 million, lower earnings of 159.9 million (after non-cash reconciling items), a decrease in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of 133.3 million and an increase in deferred sales commissions of 59.8 million, partially offset by net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of 166.0 million and an increase in accrued compensation of 127.4 million. During 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was 1.1 billion, compared to 1.3 billion during 2021. The change primarily was due to lower earnings of 265.1 million (after non-cash reconciling items), a decrease in accrued compensation of 200.8 million and a decrease in broker-dealer related payables (net of receivable and segregated U.S. Treasury Bills activity) of 169.2 million, partially offset by net activity of our consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of 252.0 million and an increase in fees receivable of 193.3 million. 
 During 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 33.6 million, compared to 22.0 million during 2022. The change is due to the acquisition of CarVal, net cash acquired of 40.3 million in 2022, partially offset by lower purchases of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements of 28.7 million. During 2022, net cash used in investing activities was 22.0 million, compared to 65.7 million during 2021. The change is primarily due to the acquisition of CarVal, net cash acquired of 40.3 million in 2022. 
 During 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 1.0 billion, compared to 1.1 billion during 2022. The change reflects lower cash distributions to Unitholders of 230.6 million, a decrease in the net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plans of 66.5 million and the repayment of CarVal debt of 42.7 million, partially offset by higher net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds of 187.1 million and lower net borrowings of debt of 70.7 million. During 2022, net cash used in financing activities was 1.1 billion, compared to 0.9 billion during 2021. The change reflects lower net purchases of non-controlling interests of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds in 2022 of 309.9 million, repayment of CarVal debt of 42.7 million and a decrease in overdrafts payable of 41.6 million, partially offset by higher net borrowings of debt of 155.0 million and a decrease in the net purchases of AB Holding Units to fund long-term incentive compensation plans of 51.3 million. 
 As of December 31, 2023, AB had 1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents of consolidated company-sponsored investment funds and cash held-for-sale), all of which is available for liquidity but consist primarily of cash on deposit for our broker-dealers related to various customer clearing activities and cash held by foreign subsidiaries of 585.8 million.

 See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for disclosures relating to our debt and credit facilities. We use our debt and credit facilities to seed certain new investment products which may expose us to market risk, credit risk and material gains and losses. To reduce our exposure, we enter into various futures, forwards, options and swaps primarily to economically hedge certain of our seed money investments. While in most cases broad market risks are hedged and are effective in reducing our exposure, our hedgers are imperfect and we may remain exposed to some market risk and credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on these derivative instruments. 
 Our financial condition and access to public and private debt markets should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs. Management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and AB Units or AB Holding Units will provide us with the resources we need to meet our financial obligations. See Risk Factors in Item 1A and Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Item 7 for a discussion of credit markets and our ability to renew our credit facilities at expiration. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 
 Guarantees 
 Under various circumstances, AB guarantees the obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 AB maintains a guarantee in connection with an 800 million committed, unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the " Credit Facility "). If SCB LLC is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. SCB LLC currently has five uncommitted lines of credit with five financial institutions. Four of these lines of credit permit us to borrow up to an aggregate of approximately 315.0 million, with AB named as an additional borrower, while the other line has no stated limit. AB has guaranteed the obligations of SCB LLC under these lines of credit. AB maintains guarantees totaling 415.0 million for SCB LLC s five uncommitted lines of credit. 
 AB maintains a guarantee with a commercial bank, under which we guarantee the obligations in the ordinary course of business of each of SCB LLC, our U.K.-based broker-dealer and our Cayman subsidiary. We also maintain three additional guarantees with other commercial banks under which we guarantee approximately 270.9 million of obligations for our U.K.-based broker-dealer and 99.0 million of obligations for our India-based broker-dealer. In the event that any of these three entities is unable to meet its obligations, AB will pay the obligations when due or on demand. 
 We also have two smaller guarantees with a commercial bank totaling approximately 1.9 million, under which we guarantee certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of one of our foreign subsidiaries. 
 We have not been required to perform under any of the above agreements and currently have no liability in connection with these agreements. 
 
 Aggregate Contractual Obligations 
 We have various compensation and benefit obligations, including accrued salaries and fringes, commissions, payroll taxes, incentive payments and deferred compensation arrangements. The majority of our compensation and benefits obligations are paid out in less than one year, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years. Accrued compensation and benefits as of December 31, 2023 totaled 354.5 million. This amount excludes our accrued pension obligation. Offsetting our accrued compensation obligations are long-term incentive compensation-related investments and money market investments we funded totaling 41.1 million, which are included in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Any amounts reflected on the consolidated statement of financial condition as payables (to broker-dealers, brokerage clients and company-sponsored mutual funds) and accounts payable and accrued expenses are excluded from the aforementioned accrued compensation and benefits obligation amount. 
 We expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately 19.0 million in each of the next four years. We do not currently anticipate that we will contribute to the Retirement Plan during 2024. 
 The 2017 Tax Act (enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017) imposed a federal transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of certain deferred foreign earnings. Management elected to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period from 2018 to 2025. The federal transition tax obligation as of December 31, 2023 totaled 8.7 million and is recorded to income tax payable on our consolidated statement of financial condition. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our taxes. 
 See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion of our leases. 
 See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our debt.

 Contingencies 
 See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
 Management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. 
 
 Goodwill 
 Our acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, where the cost of the acquisition is allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, results in the recognition of goodwill. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had goodwill of 3.6 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition, which included 666.1 million as a result of the CarVal Investors L.P. (" CarVal ") acquisition in the third quarter of 2022, 2.8 billion as a result of the Sanford C. Bernstein Inc. Bernstein acquisition in 2000 and 291.9 million in regard to various smaller acquisitions. Approximately 159.8 million of goodwill has been classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial condition. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures in Item 8 to these consolidated financial statements . 
 We have determined that AB has only one reporting segment and reporting unit. We test our goodwill annually, as of September 30, for impairment or if certain events or changes in circumstances occur and trigger an interim impairment test. The carrying value of goodwill is also reviewed if facts and circumstances occur that suggest possible impairment, such as, but not limited to significant transactions including acquisitions or divestitures and significant declines in AUM, revenues, earnings or the price of an AB Holding Unit. Any of these changes in circumstances could suggest the possibility that goodwill is impaired, but none of these events or circumstances by itself would indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Instead, they are merely recognized as triggering events for the consideration of impairment and must be viewed in combination with any mitigating or positive factors. A holistic evaluation of all events since the most recent quantitative impairment test must be done to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit is impaired. 
 For our annual impairment test, we utilize the market approach where the fair value of the reporting unit is based on its unadjusted market valuation (AB Units outstanding multiplied by AB Holding's Unit price) and earnings multiples. A goodwill impairment would be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test does not include a determination by management of whether a decline in fair value is temporary and it is important that management's determination of fair value reflect the impact of changing market conditions, including the severity and anticipated duration of any such changes. The price of a publicly traded AB Holding Unit serves as a reasonable starting point for valuing an AB Unit because each represents the same fractional interest in our underlying business. Our market approach analysis also includes comparable industry earnings multiples applied to our earnings forecast and assumes a control premium (when applicable). 
 Contingent Payment Arrangements 
 We periodically enter into contingent payment arrangements in connection with our business combinations. In these arrangements, we agree to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain performance targets are achieved. We estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and record a liability on a discounted basis on our consolidated statement of financial condition. We then accrete the obligation to its expected payment amount over the measurement period. If our expected payment amount subsequently changes, the obligation is modified in the current period resulting in a gain or loss. Both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within contingent payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of income. 
 For contingent liabilities, we typically use a valuation method that is a form of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We develop a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the performance objectives that are then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows.

 Loss Contingencies 
 Management continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation. We evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists and record a loss contingency if it is both probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 .

 Cautions Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements provided by management in this report are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The most significant of these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: the performance of financial markets, the investment performance of sponsored investment products and separately managed accounts, general economic conditions, industry trends, future acquisitions, integration of acquired companies, competitive conditions and government regulations, including changes in tax regulations and rates and the manner in which the earnings of publicly-traded partnerships are taxed. We caution readers to carefully consider such factors. Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made; we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. For further information regarding these forward-looking statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ, see Risk Factors in Item 1A . Any or all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Form 10-K, other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, and any other public statements we issue, may turn out to be wrong. It is important to remember that other factors besides those listed in Risk Factors and those listed below could also adversely impact our revenues, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. 
 The forward-looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph, most of which directly affect AB but also affect AB Holding because AB Holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in AB, include statements regarding: 
 Our belief that the cash flow AB Holding realizes from its investment in AB will provide AB Holding with the resources it needs to meet its financial obligations: AB Holding s cash flow is dependent on the quarterly cash distributions it receives from AB. Accordingly, AB Holding s ability to meet its financial obligations is dependent on AB s cash flow from its operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets and other factors beyond our control. 
 Our financial condition and ability to access the public and private capital markets providing adequate liquidity for our general business needs: Our financial condition is dependent on our cash flow from operations, which is subject to the performance of the capital markets, our ability to maintain and grow client assets under management and other factors beyond our control. Our ability to access public and private capital markets on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, our firm s credit ratings, our profitability and changes in government regulations, including tax rates and interest rates. 
 The outcome of litigation: Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive damage awards do occur. Though we have stated that we do not expect any pending legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, any settlement or judgment with respect to a legal proceeding could be significant, and could have such an effect. 
 The possibility that we will engage in open market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program: The number of AB Holding Units AB may decide to buy in future periods, if any, to help fund incentive compensation awards depends on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the fluctuation in the price of an AB Holding Unit (NYSE: AB) and the availability of cash to make these purchases. 
 Our determination that adjusted employee compensation expense, excluding the impact of performance-based fees, generally should not exceed 50 of our adjusted net revenues on an annual basis: Aggregate employee compensation reflects employee performance and competitive compensation levels. Fluctuations in our revenues and/or changes in competitive compensation levels could result in adjusted employee compensation expense exceeding 50 of our adjusted net revenues. 
 Our Relocation Strategy: While many of the expenses, expense savings and EPU impact we expect will result from our Relocation Strategy are presented with numerical specificity, and we believe these figures to be reasonable as of the date of this report, the uncertainties surrounding the assumptions on which our estimates are based create a significant risk that our current estimates may not be realized. These assumptions include: 
 the amount and timing of employee relocation costs, severance, and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs we experience; and 
 the timing for execution of each phase of our relocation implementation plan.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market Risk, Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments 
 Our investments consist of trading and other investments. Trading investments include U.S. Treasury Bills, mutual funds, exchange-traded options and various separately-managed portfolios consisting of equity securities. Trading investments are purchased for short-term investment, principally to fund liabilities related to long-term incentive compensation plans and to seed new investment services. Other investments include investments in hedge funds we sponsor and other investment vehicles. 
 We enter into various futures, forwards, swaps and options primarily to economically hedge our seed capital investments. We do not hold any derivatives designated in a formal hedge relationship under ASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging. See Note 7 Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 Trading and Non-Trading Market Risk Sensitive Instruments 
 Investments with Interest Rate Risk Fair Value

 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the General Partner and Unitholders of AllianceBernstein L.P. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of AllianceBernstein L.P. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in partners capital and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Performance Based Fees 
 
 As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s performance-based fees earned were 144.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are earned based on the value of the investors assets under management (AUM). The transaction price for the asset management performance obligation for certain investment advisory contracts, including those associated with hedge funds and alternative investments, provide for a performance-based fee, in addition to the base advisory fee, which is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time. The performance-based fees are forms of variable consideration and are therefore excluded from the transaction price until it becomes probable that there will not be significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized. Constraining factors impacting the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price include the contractual claw-back provisions to which the variable consideration is subject, the length of time to which the uncertainty of the consideration is subject, the number and range of possible consideration amounts, the probability of significant fluctuations in the AUM market value, and the level at which the AUM value exceeds the contractual threshold required to earn such a fee. Management calculates AUM using established market-based valuation methods and fair valuation (non-observable market) methods. Fair valuation methods, which include discounted cash flow models and other methods, are used only where AUM cannot be valued using market-based valuation methods, such as in the case of private equity or illiquid securities. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to performance-based fees is a critical audit matter are (i) a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to these fees, including evaluating audit evidence related to the assessment of the constraining factors impacting the amount of variable consideration and the calculation of AUM and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s revenue recognition process for performance-based fees, including controls over the assessment of the constraining factors and the calculation of AUM. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for determining performance-based fees, including evaluating the appropriateness of the fair valuation methods used to calculate AUM; (ii) evaluating, on a sample basis, the reasonableness of the constraining factors related to (a) contractual claw-back provisions to which variable consideration is subject, (b) the length of time to which the uncertainty of the consideration is subject, (c) the number and range of possible consideration amounts, (d) the probability of significant fluctuations in the AUM market value, and (e) the level at which the AUM value exceeded the contractual threshold required to earn such fees, as applicable. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the AUM by (i) developing an independent range of prices for a sample of securities in the underlying products where fair valuation methods were used and (ii) comparing the independent range of prices to management s estimate. Developing the independent range of prices involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing the inputs for the sampled securities.

 We periodically enter into contingent payment arrangements in connection with our business combinations. In these arrangements, we agree to pay additional consideration to the sellers to the extent that certain performance targets are achieved. We estimate the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and record a liability on a discounted basis on our consolidated statement of financial condition. We then accrete the obligation to its expected payment amount over the measurement period. If our expected payment amount subsequently changes, the obligation is modified in the current period resulting in a gain or loss. Both gains and losses resulting from changes to expected payments and the accretion of these obligations to their expected payment amounts are reflected within contingent payment arrangements in our consolidated statements of income. The CarVal acquisition resulted in the recording of a contingent consideration payable of million if certain performance targets are achieved over a period (see Note 9 Fair Value and Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures) . As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the contingent consideration payable associated with the CarVal acquisition was million and million, respectively. During 2023, we recorded an expense of million due to a change in estimate related to the contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Autonomous LLC in 2019. The change in estimate was based upon better than expected revenues during the 2023 performance evaluation period. We recorded million as contingent payment arrangement expense and million as compensation and benefits expense in the condensed consolidated statement of income. The charges to compensation and benefits expense are due to certain service conditions and special awards included in the acquisition agreement. During 2023 and 2022, there were impairments of contingent consideration payable recorded in the consolidated statements of income. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded an impairment of the contingent consideration payable related to our 2016 acquisition of Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC. of of million.

 The CarVal acquisition in the third quarter of 2022 resulted in recording of million of finite-lived intangible assets primarily relating to investment management contracts and investor relationships with useful lives ranging from to years (see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures ). 
 As of December 31, 2023, intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of million on the consolidated statement of financial condition consists of million of finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization and million of indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization. 
 As of December 31, 2022, intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of million on the consolidated statement of financial condition consisted of million of finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization and million of indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization in regard to other acquisitions. 
 The gross carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets totaled million as of December 31, 2023 and million as of December 31, 2022, and accumulated amortization was million as of December 31, 2023 and million as of December 31, 2022. 
 Amortization expense was million for 2023, million for 2022 and million for 2021. Estimated future annual amortization expense is approximately million annually in years one through three and million in year four and five. 
 We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This test is performed at least annually or as triggering events occur. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, we perform an impairment assessment to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we performed an impairment assessment of our intangible assets. The impairment assessment indicated that our intangible assets were t impaired. During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we recorded impairments of million and million, related to our 2014 acquisition of CPH Capital and our 2016 acquisition of Ramius Alternative Solutions LLC, respectively. Due to the loss of acquired investment management contracts during each respective year, the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible assets exceeded the fair value of the contracts. We determined the fair value of the contracts using a discounted cash flow model. The impairment charge was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

These restricted AB Holding Units are not forfeitable (except if the Eligible Director is terminated for Cause, as that term is defined in the applicable award agreement). We fully expense these awards on grant date, as there is no service requirement. 
 We fund our restricted AB Holding Unit awards either by purchasing AB Holding Units on the open market or purchasing newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, and then keeping these AB Holding Units in a consolidated rabbi trust until delivering them or retiring them. In accordance with the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AB AB ), when AB purchases newly-issued AB Holding Units from AB Holding, AB Holding is required to use the proceeds it receives from AB to purchase the equivalent number of newly issued AB Units, thus increasing its percentage ownership interest in AB.

 Each quarter, we consider whether to implement a plan to repurchase AB Holding Units pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ). A plan of this type allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or because it possesses material non-public information. Each broker we select has the authority to repurchase AB Holding Units on our behalf in accordance with the terms and limitations specified in the plan. Repurchases are subject to regulations promulgated by the SEC as well as certain price, market volume and timing constraints specified in the plan. There was no plan adopted during the fourth quarter of 2023. We may adopt additional plans in the future to engage in open-market purchases of AB Holding Units to help fund anticipated obligations under our incentive compensation award program and for other corporate purposes. 
 During 2023, we granted to employees and Eligible Directors million restricted AB Holding Units (including million granted in December for 2023 year-end awards to employees). During 2022, we granted to employees and Eligible Directors million restricted AB Holding Units (including million granted in December for 2022 year-end awards to employees). We used AB Holding Units repurchased during the periods and newly-issued AB Holding Units to fund these awards.

 The underlying investments of hedge funds in which we invest include long and short positions in equity securities, fixed income securities (including various agency and non-agency asset-based securities), currencies, commodities and derivatives (including various swaps and forward contracts). These investments are valued at quoted market prices or, where quoted market prices are not available, are fair valued based on the pricing policies and procedures of the underlying funds. 
 We allocate seed capital to our investment teams to help develop new products and services for our clients. A portion of our seed capital trading investments are equity and fixed income products, primarily in the form of separately managed account portfolios, U.S. mutual funds, Luxembourg funds, Japanese investment trust management funds or Delaware business trusts. We also may allocate seed capital to investments in private equity funds. Regarding our seed capital investments, the amounts above reflect those funds in which we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE or hold a controlling financial interest in a VOE. See Note 15, Consolidated Company-Sponsored Investment Funds , for a description of the seed capital investments that we consolidated. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our total seed capital investments were million and million, respectively. Seed capital investments in unconsolidated company-sponsored investment funds are valued using published net asset values or non-published net asset values if they are not listed on an active exchange but have net asset values that are comparable to funds with published net asset values and have no redemption restrictions. 
 In addition, we also have long positions in corporate equities and long exchange-traded options traded through our options desk.

 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the derivative assets and liabilities are included in both receivables and payables to brokers and dealers on our consolidated statements of financial condition. Gains and losses on derivative instruments are reported in investment gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of income. 
 We may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. We minimize our counterparty exposure through a credit review and approval process. In addition, we have executed various collateral arrangements with counterparties to the over-the-counter derivative transactions that require both pledging and accepting collateral in the form of cash and U.S. Treasuries. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we held million and million, respectively, of cash collateral payable to trade counterparties. This obligation to return cash is reported in payables to brokers and dealers in our consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 Although notional amount is the typical measure of volume in the derivatives market, it is not used as a measure of credit risk. Generally, the current credit exposure of our derivative contracts is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of netting agreements and any collateral received. A derivative with positive value (a derivative asset) indicates existence of credit risk because the counterparty would owe us if the contract were closed. Alternatively, a derivative contract with negative value (a derivative liability) indicates we would owe money to the counterparty if the contract were closed. Generally, if there is more than one derivative transaction with a single counterparty, a master netting arrangement exists with respect to derivative transactions with that counterparty to provide for aggregate net settlement. 
 Our standardized contracts for over-the-counter derivative transactions, known as ISDA master agreements, provide for collateralization. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we delivered million and million, respectively, of cash collateral into brokerage accounts. We report this cash collateral in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of financial condition. 
 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, long and short exchange-traded equity options were classified as held for sale on our consolidated statement of financial position. For further discussion, see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestitures.

 We provide below a description of the fair value methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy: 
 Money markets: We invest excess cash in various money market funds that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets; these are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Treasury Bills: We hold U.S. Treasury Bills, which are primarily segregated in a special reserve bank custody account as required by Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act. These securities are valued based on quoted yields in secondary markets and are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Equity securities: Our equity securities consist principally of company-sponsored mutual funds with NAVs and various separately managed portfolios consisting primarily of equity and fixed income mutual funds with quoted prices in active markets, which are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, some securities are valued based on observable inputs from recognized pricing vendors, which are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Derivatives: We hold exchange-traded futures with counterparties that are included in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. In addition, we also hold currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, option swaps and total return swaps with counterparties that are valued based on observable inputs from recognized pricing vendors, which are included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 Contingent payment arrangements: Contingent payment arrangements relate to contingent payment liabilities associated with various acquisitions. At each reporting date, we estimate the fair values of the contingent consideration expected to be paid upon probability-weighted AUM and revenue projections, using unobservable market data inputs, which are included in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 securities.

 In the third quarter of 2022, we acquired CarVal and recorded a contingent consideration liability of million (see Note 24 Acquisitions and Divestiture s). The liability, ranging from to million, is based on CarVal achieving certain performance objectives over a period ending December 31, 2027. The liability was valued using a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the performance objectives that are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate.

 million committed, unsecured senior revolving credit facility (the " Credit Facility ") with a group of commercial banks and other lenders, which matures on October 13, 2026. The Credit Facility was amended and restated on February 9, 2023, to reflect the transition from US LIBOR, which was retired June 30, 2023, to the term Secured Overnight Financial Rate (" SOFR "). Other than this immaterial change, there were no other significant changes included in the amendment. The Credit Facility provides for possible increases in the principal amount by up to an aggregate incremental amount of million; any such increase is subject to the consent of the affected lenders. The Credit Facility is available for AB and Sanford C. Bernstein Co., LLC (" SCB LLC ") business purposes, including the support of AB s commercial paper program. Both AB and SCB LLC can draw directly under the Credit Facility and management may draw on the Credit Facility from time to time. AB has agreed to guarantee the obligations of SCB LLC under the Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, which are customary for facilities of this type, including restrictions on dispositions of assets, restrictions on liens, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. The Credit Facility also includes customary events of default (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or lender s commitments may be terminated. Also, under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency- or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Facility would automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lender s commitments automatically would terminate. 
 Amounts under the Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed by us from time to time until the maturity of the facility. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions requested by us are permitted at any time without a fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the prepayment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, which will be, at our option, a rate equal to an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of AB, plus one of the following indices: SOFR; a Prime rate; or the Federal Funds rate. 
 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. During 2023 and 2022, we did t draw upon the Credit Facility.

 Legal Proceedings 
 With respect to all significant litigation matters, we consider the likelihood of a negative outcome. If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses for such matters, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and we disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of losses. However, it is often difficult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages. Such is particularly the case when the litigation is in its early stages or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope. In these cases, we disclose that we are unable to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss. As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to our significant litigation matters.

 individual participants in the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of AllianceBernstein L.P., (the " Plan ") filed a class action complaint (the Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AB, current and former members of the Compensation and Workplace Practices Committee of the Board, and the Investment and Administrative Committees under the Plan. Plaintiffs, who seek to represent a class of all participants in the Plan from December 14, 2016 to the present, allege that defendants violated their fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" ERISA ") by including proprietary collective investment trusts as investment options offered under the Plan. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and other equitable relief. AB is prepared to defend itself vigorously against these claims and filed a motion to dismiss on February 24, 2023. While the ultimate outcome of this matter is currently not determinable given the matter remains in its early stages, we do not believe this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 AB may be involved in various other matters, including regulatory inquiries, administrative proceedings and litigation, some of which may allege significant damages. It is reasonably possible that AB could incur losses pertaining to these other matters, but management cannot currently estimate any such losses. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, currently believes that the outcome of any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, any inquiry, proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty; management cannot determine whether further developments relating to any individual matter that is pending or threatened, or all of them combined, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in any future reporting period.

 Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 
 In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of , management considered the historical returns and future expectations for returns for each asset category, as well as the target asset allocation of the portfolio. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the mortality projection assumption used the generational MP-2021 improvement scale, which is consistent with the improvement scale used in 2022 and 2021. The base mortality assumption used is the Society of Actuaries PRI-2012 base mortality table for private sector plans, with a white-collar adjustment, using the contingent annuitant table for beneficiaries of deceased participants. 
 For fiscal year-end 2023, we reflected the most recently published Internal Revenue Service table for lump sums assumed to be paid in 2023. We projected future mortality for lump sums assumed to be paid after 2023 using the current base mortality tables (RP-2014 backed off to 2006) and projection scale of MP-2021.

 The guidelines regarding allocation of assets are formalized in the Investment Policy Statement adopted by the Investment Committee for the Retirement Plan. The objective of the investment program is to enhance the portfolio of the Retirement Plan through total return (capital appreciation and income), thereby promoting the ongoing ability of the Plan to meet future liabilities and obligations, while minimizing the need for additional contributions, and managing the Plan's funded status appropriately. The guidelines specify a target allocation weighting of for liability hedging investments and for return seeking investments.

 Effective as of September 30, 2017, we established the AB 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan 2017 Plan ), which was adopted at a special meeting of AB Holding Unitholders held on September 29, 2017. The following forms of awards may be granted to employees and Eligible Directors (directors who satisfy applicable independence standards) under the 2017 Plan: (i) restricted AB Holding Units or phantom restricted AB Holding Units (a phantom award is a contractual right to receive AB Holding Units at a later date or upon a specified event); (ii) options to buy AB Holding Units; and (iii) other AB Holding Unit-based awards (including, without limitation, AB Holding Unit appreciation rights and performance awards). The purpose of the 2017 Plan is to promote the interest of AB by: (i) attracting and retaining talented officers, employees and directors, (ii) motivating such officers, employees and directors by means of performance-related incentives to achieve longer-range business and operational goals, (iii) enabling such officers, employees and directors to participate in the long-term growth and financial success of AB, and (iv) aligning the interests of such officers, employees and directors with those of AB Holding Unitholders. The 2017 Plan will expire on September 30, 2027, and no awards under the 2017 Plan will be made after that date. Under the 2017 Plan, the aggregate number of AB Holding Units with respect to which awards may be granted is million, including no more than million newly-issued AB Holding Units. 
 As of December 31, 2023, options to buy AB Holding Units were outstanding and AB Holding Units, net of withholding tax requirements, were subject to other AB Holding Unit awards made under the 2017 Plan or the AllianceBernstein 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, an equity compensation plan with similar terms that was canceled on September 30, 2017. AB Holding Unit-based awards (including options) in respect of AB Holding Units were available for grant under the 2017 Plan as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of December 31, 2022, options to buy AB Holding Units had been granted and AB Holding Units, net of withholding tax requirements, were subject to other AB Holding Unit awards made under the 2017 Plan or the AllianceBernstein 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended, an equity compensation plan with similar terms that was canceled on September 30, 2017. AB Holding Unit-based awards (including options) in respect of AB Holding Units were available for grant under the 2017 Plan as of December 31, 2022. 
 Clawbacks 
 The award agreement contained in the Incentive Compensation Program permits AB to clawback the unvested portion of an award if the recipient fails to adhere to our risk management policies. Further, pursuant to Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " Rule ") and Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, the Board of Directors (the " Board ") has adopted a Compensation Recovery Policy (the "Policy ") effective November 15, 2023. Pursuant to the Policy, the Company will promptly recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (as defined by section 10D(b)(1) to include any compensation that is granted, earned or vested wholly or in part upon attainment of a financial reporting measure) from any current or former Executive Officer of the Company as defined by Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act as required under the Exchange Act and the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The company does not currently award incentive-based compensation as defined by the Rule. We have filed the Policy as Exhibit 97.01 to this Form 10-K. 
 The portion of incentive-based compensation received from EQH specific to Seth Bernstein, our Chief Executive Officer, is covered under the Compensation Recovery Policy adopted by our parent EQH and will be applicable to any current or previous incentive-based compensation received directly from our parent company by Mr. Bernstein. 
 Option Awards 
 We did not grant any options to buy AB Holding Units during 2023, 2022 or 2021. Historically, options granted to employees generally were exercisable at a rate of of the AB Holding Units subject to such options on each of the first five anniversary dates of the date of grant; options granted to Eligible Directors generally were exercisable at a rate of of the AB Holding Units subject to such options on each of the first three anniversary dates of the date of grant. There was no option-related activity in our equity compensation plans during 2023.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2023, 2022 or 2021 was , million and million, respectively. 
 Under the fair value method, compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the options awarded (determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model) and is recognized over the requisite service period. As we did not grant any option awards in 2023, 2022 or 2021, compensation expense was recorded. As of December 31, 2023, there was compensation expense related to unvested option grants not yet recognized in the consolidated statement of income. 
 Restricted AB Holding Unit Awards 
 In 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Board granted restricted AB Holding Unit awards to Eligible Directors. These AB Holding Units give the Eligible Directors, in most instances, all the rights of other AB Holding Unitholders, subject to such restrictions on transfer as the Board may impose. 
 We award restricted AB Holding Units to Eligible Directors that vest ratably over three years for awards granted in 2021). We fully expensed these awards on each grant date, as there is no service requirement. 
 Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Compensation Expense (in millions) 
 On April 28, 2017, Seth Bernstein was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer . In connection with the commencement of his employment, Mr. Bernstein was granted restricted AB Holding Units; these Units were fully amortized as of December 31, 2021. Compensation expense related to Mr. Bernstein's restricted AB Holding Unit grant was million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Under the Incentive Compensation Program, we awarded million restricted AB Holding Units in 2023 (which included million restricted AB Holding Units in December for the 2023 year-end awards as well as million additional restricted AB Holding Units granted earlier during the year relating to the 2022 year-end awards), with grant date fair values per restricted AB Holding Unit ranging between to .

 New York City unincorporated business tax UBT ). Our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local income taxes, and generally are included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return. Separate state and local income tax returns also are filed. Foreign corporate subsidiaries generally are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions where they are located. 
 In order to preserve AB s status as a private partnership for federal income tax purposes, AB Units must not be considered publicly traded. The AB Partnership Agreement provides that all transfers of AB Units must be approved by EQH and the General Partner; EQH and the General Partner approve only those transfers permitted pursuant to one or more of the safe harbors contained in the relevant Treasury regulations. If AB Units were considered readily tradable, AB s net income would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax, significantly reducing its quarterly distributions to AB Holding. Furthermore, should AB enter into a substantial new line of business, AB Holding, by virtue of its ownership of AB, would lose its status as a publicly traded partnership and would become subject to corporate income tax, which would reduce materially AB Holding s net income and its quarterly distributions to AB Holding Unitholders.

 We recognize the effects of a tax position in the financial statements only if, as of the reporting date, it is more likely than not to be sustained based on its technical merits and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position.

 Valuation allowances of million and million were established as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily due to significant negative evidence that capital losses anticipated in the held for sale foreign subsidiaries will not be utilized, given the nature of income expected to be incurred by the applicable subsidiaries. During 2023, we recognized a one-time tax benefit of million from the release of a valuation allowance on a capital loss tax asset due to a tax planning action identified in the fourth quarter, due to a future restructuring of certain foreign subsidiaries that would not have a material impact on AB operations. We had net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2023 and 2022 of approximately million and million, respectively, in certain foreign locations with a five year expiration period. 
 The deferred tax asset is included in other assets in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Management believes there will be sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets recognized that are not subject to valuation allowances. 
 The company provides income taxes on the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.

 interest in the joint venture and SocGen would own a interest in the global joint venture, with an option to reach ownership after . 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, AB and SocGen negotiated a revised plan (the " Revised Plan ") to form a North American joint venture (the " NA JV ") and an International joint venture (the " International JV "). Under the Revised Plan, AB would own a majority economic and voting interest in the NA JV and a economic and voting interest in the International JV. The Revised Plan, as compared to the Initial Plan, will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 SocGen will continue to have an option to reach ownership in the International JV after and AB would have an option to sell its share in both joint ventures to SocGen, subject to regulatory approval. The consummation of the joint ventures is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearances. The closings are expected to occur in the first half of 2024. 
 The structure of the Board of Directors of the NA JV Holding Company, which will include two independent directors, precludes AB from controlling the Board and therefore from having a controlling financial interest in the entity. Upon review of the consolidation guidance under U.S. GAAP, we have concluded we will not consolidate the NA JV Holding Company and will maintain an equity method investment in both the NA JV and the International JV holding companies. Accordingly , the assets and liabilities of AB's research services business the disposal group continue to be classified as held for sale on the consolidated statement of financial condition and recorded at fair value, less cost to sell. As a result of classifying these assets as held for sale, we recognized a non-cash valuation adjustment of million in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, as well as million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, to recognize the net carrying value at lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Approximately million in costs to sell have been paid as of December 31, 2023.

 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents classified as held for sale included in the consolidated statement of cash flows were million and million, respectively. 
 We have determined that the exit from the sell-side research business does not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on our consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, we have not classified the disposal group as discontinued operations. The results of operations of the disposal group up to the respective dates of sale will be included in our consolidated results of operations for all periods presented. The lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment upon transferring these assets to held for sale was not material. 
 A cquisitions 
 On July 1, 2022, AB Holding acquired a ownership interest in CarVal, a global private alternatives investment manager primarily focused on opportunistic and distressed credit, renewable energy, infrastructure, specialty finance and transportation investments that, as of the acquisition date, constituted approximately billion in AUM. Also, on July 1, 2022, immediately following the acquisition of CarVal, AB Holding contributed of its equity interests in CarVal to AB in exchange for AB Units. Post-acquisition, CarVal was rebranded AB CarVal Investors AB CarVal ). 
 On the acquisition date, AB Holding issued approximately million AB Holding Units (with a fair value of million) with the remaining million Units (with a fair value of million) issued on November 1, 2022. The fair value of the units issued on November 1, 2022 reflect final adjustments to the estimated unit issuance recorded as of acquisition close on July 1, 2022 and as disclosed in the third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q. 
 AB received a equity interest in CarVal from AB Holding and issued approximately million AB Units (with a fair value of million). AB also recorded a contingent consideration payable of million (to be paid predominantly in AB Units) based on AB CarVal achieving certain performance objectives over a period ending December 31, 2027. The AB Units, as discussed above , were issued to AB Holding; AB Holding then issued the equal amount of AB Holding Units to CarVal. The excess of the purchase price over the current fair value of identifiable net liabilities acquired of million (net of cash acquired of million), and the recording of a net deferred tax asset of million resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and the recording of million of finite-lived intangible assets primarily relating to investment management contracts and investor relationships with useful lives ranging from to years. The goodwill recorded is not deductible for tax purposes as the CarVal acquisition was an investment in a partnership.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Each of AB Holding and AB maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Interim Chief Financial Officer CFO ), to permit timely decisions regarding our disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and the CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for each of AB Holding and AB. 
 Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP and receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 
 Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of AB Holding s and AB s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (the COSO criteria ). 
 Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, each of AB Holding and AB maintained effective internal control over financial reporting based on the COSO criteria. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PCAOB ID No. ), the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the 2023 financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of each of AB Holding s and AB s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. The reports pertaining to AB Holding and AB each can be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Item 9B. Other Information 
 We reported all information required to be disclosed on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Pursuant to Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, there were no directors or officers that had or a 10b5-1 plan or other trading arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2023.

 General Partner 
 The Partnerships activities are managed and controlled by the General Partner. The Board of the General Partner acts as the Board of each of the Partnerships. Neither AB Unitholders nor AB Holding Unitholders have rights to manage or control the Partnerships or to elect directors of the General Partner. The General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQH. 
 The General Partner does not receive any compensation from the Partnerships for services rendered to them as their general partner. The General Partner holds a 1 general partnership interest in AB and 100,000 units of general partnership interest in AB Holding. Each general partnership unit in AB Holding is entitled to receive distributions equal to those received by each AB Holding Unit. Similarly, the 1 general partnership interest in AB is entitled to receive distributions equal to those received by each AB Unit. 
 The General Partner is entitled to reimbursement by AB for any expenses it incurs in carrying out its activities as general partner of the Partnerships, including compensation paid by the General Partner to its directors and officers (to the extent such persons are not compensated directly by AB). 
 Board of Directors 
 Our Board consists of 9 directors, including five independent directors (including our Chair of the Board), our President and CEO, and three senior executives of EQH. While we do not have a formal, written diversity policy in place, we believe that an effective board consists of a diverse group of individuals who collectively possess a variety of complementary skills, personal experiences and perspectives and who will work together to provide a board with the needed leadership and experience to successfully guide our company. As set forth in its charter, the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (the Governance Committee assists the Board in identifying and evaluating such candidates, determining Board composition, developing and monitoring a process to assess Board effectiveness, developing and implementing corporate governance guidelines, and reviewing programs relating to matters of corporate responsibility. 
 As we indicate below , our directors have a combined wealth of leadership experience derived from extensive service leading large, complex organizations in their roles as either senior executives or board members, as well as in government and academia. Each of our directors has the integrity, business judgment, collegiality and commitment that are among the essential characteristics for a member of our Board. Collectively, they have substantive knowledge and skills applicable to our business, including expertise in areas such as asset management; regulation; public accounting and financial reporting; finance; risk management; business development; operations; information technology and security; strategic planning; management development, succession planning and compensation; corporate governance; public policy; and international matters.

 Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
 Leadership 
 The Board, together with the Governance Committee, is responsible for reviewing the Board s leadership structure. In determining the appropriate individuals to serve as our Chair and our CEO, the Board and the Governance Committee consider, among other things, the composition of the Board, our company s strong corporate governance practices, and the challenges and opportunities specific to AB. 
 Contacting our Board 
 Interested parties wishing to communicate directly with our Chair or the other members of our Board may send an e-mail, with confidential in the subject line, to our Corporate Secretary or address mail to Ms. Lamm-Tennant in care of our Corporate Secretary. Our Corporate Secretary will promptly forward such e-mail or mail to Ms. Lamm-Tennant. We have posted this information in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 Risk Oversight 
 Board of Directors The Board, together with the Audit Committee, has oversight for our company s risk management framework, which includes investment risk, credit and counterparty risk, and operational risk (includes legal/regulatory risk, cyber security risk and climate risk), and is responsible for helping to ensure that these risks are managed in a sound manner. 
 
 q Audit Committee The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, the responsibility to consider our company s policies and practices with respect to investment, credit and counterparty, and operational risk assessment and risk management, including discussing with management the major financial, operational and reputational risk exposures and the steps taken to monitor and control such exposures. 
 
 p Risk Management Team Chief Risk Officer Members of the company's risk management team (including our Chief Security Officer), who are responsible for identifying, managing and controlling the array of risks inherent in our company s business and operations, make quarterly reports to the Audit Committee, which address investment, credit and counterparty, and operational risk identification, assessment and monitoring. 
 u The Chief Risk Officer makes quarterly presentations to the Audit Committee and has reporting lines to the CEO and the Audit Committee. 
 
 The Board has determined that its leadership and risk oversight are appropriate for our company. Mr. Bernstein s in-depth knowledge of financial services and extensive executive experience in the investment management industry make him well-suited to serve as our President and CEO, while Ms. Lamm-Tennant s in-depth industry and academic experience are invaluable at enhancing the overall functioning of the Board. The Board believes that the combination of a separate Chair and CEO, the Audit Committee, a specialized risk management team and significant involvement from our largest Unitholder (EQH) provide the appropriate leadership to help ensure effective risk oversight.

 Code of Ethics and Related Policies 
 Our directors, officers and employees are subject to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the " Code of Ethics "). The Code of Ethics is intended to comply with Section 303A.10 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, as well as with recommendations issued by the Investment Company Institute regarding, among other things, practices and standards with respect to securities transactions of investment professionals. The Code of Ethics establishes certain guiding principles for all of our employees, including sensitivity to our fiduciary obligations and ensuring that we meet those obligations. In addition, the Code of Ethics, together with our firm's insider trading policy, restricts employees from trading when in possession of material non-public information of any kind, which can include the existence of a significant cybersecurity incident at our firm. Our Code of Ethics may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 We have adopted a Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, which is intended to comply with Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Item 406 Code ). The Item 406 Code may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding certain amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of the Item 406 Code that apply to the CEO, the CFO and the Chief Accounting Officer by posting such information on our Internet Site. To date, there have been no such amendments or waivers. 
 NYSE Governance Matters 
 Section 303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual exempts limited partnerships from compliance with the following sections of the Manual, some of which we comply with voluntarily: Section 303A.01 (board must have a majority of independent directors), 303A.04 (corporate governance committee must have only independent directors as its members and must have a charter that addresses, among other things, the committee s purpose and responsibilities), and 303A.05 (compensation committee must have only independent directors as its members and must have a charter that addresses, among other things, the committee s purpose and responsibilities). 
 AB Holding is a limited partnership (as is AB). In addition, because the General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQH, and the General Partner controls AB Holding (and AB), we believe we also would qualify for the controlled company exemption. However, we comply voluntarily with the charter requirements set forth in Sections 303A.04 and 303A.05. 
 Our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the Guidelines promote the effective functioning of the Board and its committees, promote the interests of the Partnerships respective Unitholders (with appropriate regard to the Board s duties to the sole stockholder of the General Partner), and set forth a common set of expectations as to how the Board, its various committees, individual directors and management should perform their functions. The Guidelines may be found in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 The Governance Committee is responsible for considering any request for a waiver under the Code of Ethics, the Item 406 Code and the EQH Policy Statement on Ethics from any director or executive officer of the General Partner. No such waiver has been granted to date and, if a waiver is granted in the future, such waiver would be described in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site. 
 We include in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance, section of our Internet site an e-mail address for any interested party, including Unitholders, to communicate with the Board. Our Corporate Secretary reviews e-mails sent to that address and has some discretion in determining how or whether to respond, and in determining to whom such e-mails should be forwarded. In our experience, substantially all of the e-mails received are ordinary client requests for administrative assistance that are best addressed by management, or solicitations of various kinds. 
 Certifications by our CEO and CFO pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 have been furnished as exhibits to this Form 10-K. 
 AB Holding Unitholders and AB Unitholders may request a copy of any committee charter, the Guidelines, the Code of Ethics, and the Item 406 Code by contacting our Corporate Secretary.

 Compensation Philosophy and Goals 
 The intellectual capital of our employees is collectively the most important asset of our firm. We invest in people we hire qualified people, train them, encourage them to give their best thinking to the firm and our clients, and compensate them in a manner designed to motivate, reward and retain them while aligning their interests with the interests of our Unitholders and clients. 
 Furthermore, our compensation practices are structured to help the firm realize its long-term growth strategy to Deliver, Diversify and Expand, Responsibly, with Equitable (the Growth Strategy ), which includes firm-wide initiatives to: 
 Deliver superior investment solutions to our clients; 
 Develop high-quality differentiated services; and 
 Maintain strong incremental margins. 
 We also are focused on ensuring that our compensation practices are competitive with industry peers and provide sufficient potential for wealth creation for our NEOs and our employees generally, which we believe will enable us to meet the following key compensation goals: 
 attract, motivate and retain highly-qualified executive talent; 
 reward prior-year performance; 
 incentivize future performance; 
 recognize and support outstanding individual performance and behaviors that demonstrate and foster our firm s primary objective of helping our clients reach their financial goals; and

 Progress in Advancing our Growth Strategy in 2023 
 In 2023 we continued to show meaningful progress in executing our Growth Strategy: Deliver, Diversify, and Expand, Responsibly, with Equitable. 
 Deliver Superior Investment Solutions to our Clients: 
 Investment Performance 
 The firm s investment teams remain focused on consistently delivering differentiated return streams to our clients. We believe that, over time, the ability to produce idiosyncratic returns that cannot be easily replicated will be central to sustaining our competitive advantage. In 2023, our Fixed Income performance strengthened, with 75 of assets outperforming for the one-year period ended December 31, 2023, 73 outperforming over the three-year period and 77 outperforming for the five-year period. In Equities, performance lagged due to both stock selection and highly concentrated benchmark returns led by a small number of mega-cap technology stocks. Approximately 26 of Equity assets were in outperforming services for the one-year period, 45 for the three-year period and 42 for the five-year period ended December 31, 2023. (This performance data reflects the percentage of active Fixed Income and Equity assets in Institutional Services that outperformed their respective benchmarks, gross of fees, and of active Fixed Income and Equity assets in Retail advisor and I share class funds ranked in the top half of their Morningstar category; if no advisor class exists, we used A share class). Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, 60 of U.S. Fund assets and 69 of Non-U.S. Fund assets were rated 4- or 5-stars by Morningstar. 
 The following retail Fixed Income and Equity mutual funds with AUM greater than 100 million placed in the top quartile of performance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2023: 
 AB U.S. retail fixed income mutual funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Municipal Bond Inflation Strategy 
 AB Short-Duration High Yield 
 AB Tax-Aware Fixed Income Opportunity 
 AB Non U.S. fixed income funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Short Duration High Yield 
 AB U.S. retail equity mutual funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Equity Income 
 AB Value 
 AB Non U.S. equity funds that placed in the top quartile (3-yrs): 
 AB Asia ex-Japan 
 AB EM Low-Volatility 
 AB EM Value 
 AB International Healthcare 
 AB Low-Vol Equity 
 AB US Small and Mid- Cap Equity 
 
 Net Flows 
 Scaling our proven investment services remains a key focus of our firm. In 2023, we grew organically in two of our three distribution channels, Retail and Private Wealth, while Institutions saw net outflows. By asset class, Fixed Income grew organically at 5 , offset by outflows in Active Equity, consistent with trends seen across the industry. AB s net outflows were 7.0 billion, or 1.1 attrition, a lower rate of attrition as compared with our public peer group which experienced higher attrition. In our Retail channel, gross sales rose to 71.1 billion, up 8 versus 2022. The Retail redemption rate rose to 28 in 2023 from 24 in 2022, and full-year net inflows were 3.7 billion, driven by strong growth in both taxable and non-taxable Fixed Income. In our Institutional channel, gross sales of 11.8 billion declined from 32.2 billion in 2022, the latter of which benefited from 16 billion in funding from two custom target date mandates. Net outflows were 11.8 billion. Our pipeline of 12.0 billion in AUM decreased versus 13.2 billion a year ago, reflecting slowing institutional activity industry wide; Private Alternatives represented over 80 of the pipeline fee base at year-end. In Private Wealth, gross sales in 2023 of 18.6 billion were strong, up 6 year-over-year, and this channel generated its third straight year of net inflows, or 1.1 organic growth.

 Diversify Through Developing High-Quality Differentiated Services: 
 Growing the diversity of our offerings to meet the needs of an evolving, complex global client base remains a key focus. In 2023, new investment strategy launches across our global platform included: Security of the Future, US High Dividend ETF, Disruptors ETF, Corporate Bond ETF, Core Plus Bond ETF, Conservative Buffer ETF, Tax-Aware Intermediate Municipal ETF, Tax-Aware Long Municipal, and Fixed Maturity Portfolio 2026/2027. Additionally, we launched multiple new vehicles for existing investment strategies in response to customer demand, across a diverse set of geographies. 
 Expand: 
 In 2023, we focused on continued growth in our Private Alternatives business, with net inflows led by Secondaries, Renewable Energy, Residential Mortgage Loans and European Commercial Real Estate Debt. We announced a new NAV (Net Asset Value) lending strategy in our Private Credit business, supported by a commitment from Equitable. AB s Private Markets platform is now 61 billion, up 9 year over year, reflecting a diverse and relevant offering for Institutional, Retail and Private Wealth clients. We remain focused on expanding opportunistically, both inside and outside the U.S., to support long-term growth. We received approval in China for a wholly owned mutual fund license, and are also focused on growth in other Asian nations and select European markets. We continued to invest in our insurance asset management business to grow third party clients. And, we realized strong growth due to the redesign of our Muni investment platform to enable customization and tax optimization at scale in our custom Muni SMAs. 
 Responsibly: 
 We view responsibility as an active pursuit that unites our firm from the way we work and act, to our community service, and to the investment solutions we deliver to our clients. Internally we continued to improve on a robust corporate governance and compliance framework, including further strengthening our security and business continuity infrastructure. Through our investing activities, we continue to support proposals that encourage companies to strengthen their corporate governance structures, support shareholder rights and strive for greater transparency, in keeping with the best interest of our clients. Financially, responsibility extends to our expense management, as we maintained non-compensation expense growth below inflation levels in 2023. 
 With Equitable: 
 In 2023 Equitable announced an expansion of its program to allocate and deploy permanent capital 1 to AB s illiquid platform. Equitable's goal is to reposition and thereby further improve the risk adjusted return of its General Account, through seeding new and growing existing alternative platforms at AB. An initial 10 billion commitment was made in 2021, of which approximately 90 had been deployed in both Private Alternative and Private Placement strategies at year-end. This initial commitment includes 750 million currently being deployed to AB CarVal strategies. In May 2023, Equitable announced a second 10 billion in permanent capital commitment to AB s illiquid platform, increasing the total of its commitments to 20 billion. We expect the second commitment will begin to be deployed in 2024, following the completion of the first commitment, and will continue over the next several years. 
 Maintain Strong Incremental Margins: 
 We remain focused on managing costs to help ensure that we generate targeted incremental adjusted operating margins in the range of 45-50 , over time. In 2023, we continued to execute a key pillar of this strategy as initially announced in 2018, which was the relocation of our corporate headquarters from New York City to Nashville. We continue to seek efficiencies and manage various operating expenses to help ensure that we drive operating leverage on incremental revenues. We also continue to execute on the planned joint venture of Bernstein Research Services with Soci t G n rale (EURONEXT: GLE, SocGen ), expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. We currently anticipate this action will result in a 200-250 basis point improvement in our annual adjusted operating margin upon deconsolidation of Bernstein Research Services from our consolidated financial statements. 
 Despite improving financial markets over the course of 2023, our full year average 2023 AUM declined by 1 from 2022 levels, reflecting a lag in average AUM recovering versus the prior year. This resulted in a rolling three-year incremental adjusted operating margin of 8 , below our targeted range. Our adjusted operating margin decreased to 28.2 in 2023, down 70 basis 
 
 1 Permanent capital means investment capital of indefinite duration, for which commitments may be withdrawn under certain conditions. Such conditions primarily include potential regulatory restrictions, lacking sufficient liquidity to fund the capital commitments to AB and AB's inability to identify attractive investment opportunities which align with the investment strategy. Although EQH s insurance subsidiaries have indicated their intention over time to provide this investment capital to AB, they have no binding commitment to do so. While the withdrawal of their commitment could potentially slow down our introduction of certain products, the impact to our overall operations would not be material.

 points as compared to 28.9 in 2022. The decrease resulted from operating expense growth of 2 as compared with adjusted net revenue growth of 1 . Total adjusted compensation and benefits expense increased by 2 , promotion and servicing costs rose by 2 , and general and administrative costs rose 1 year-over-year. We provide additional information regarding our adjusted compensation ratio below in this CD see our discussion of Management Operating Metrics above in Item 7 for a reconciliation between our results pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our adjusted results.

 Overview of 2023 Incentive Compensation Program 
 When reflecting on 2023 performance and pay, each of our NEOs (other than Ms. Burke who resigned in May 2023) received a portion of his year-end incentive compensation in the form of an annual cash bonus and a portion in the form of long-term incentive compensation awards. The split between annual cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation varied depending on the NEO's total compensation, with lower-paid executives receiving a greater percentage of their incentive compensation as cash bonuses than more highly-paid executives. (For additional information about these compensatory elements, see Compensation Elements for NEOs below .) 
 In 2023, we utilized performance scorecards for senior leaders of the firm, including our NEOs. These scorecards require our senior leaders to develop and maintain a broad leadership mindset with priorities, such as accelerating ESG initiatives and our firm's alternatives platform, that are aligned with firm-wide goals of creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders. The scorecard for each NEO reflected our Growth Strategy and included actual results relative to target metrics across the following measures: 
 Financial performance, including peer results, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net revenue growth and operating efficiency targets see our discussion of Management Operating Metrics in Item 7 for a reconciliation between our results pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our adjusted results); 
 Investment performance, by delivering competitive returns across services and time periods; 
 Strategic, aligned with our strategy of delivering core investment solutions, while developing high-quality differentiated services, in faster-growing geographies, responsibly, in partnership with Equitable; 
 Organizational, including organizational effectiveness and efficiency, leadership impact, succession planning, developing talent, innovating and automating, and real estate utilization; and 
 Cultural, including purpose, employee engagement, diversity, retention and safety. 
 The scorecards support management and the Compensation Committee in assessing each executive's performance relative to business, operational and cultural goals established at the beginning of the year and reviewed in the context of the current-year financial performance of the firm. The amount of incentive compensation paid to our NEOs continues to be determined on a discretionary basis by the Compensation Committee. (For additional information, please see "Compensation Committee; Process for Determining Executive Compensation" below in this CD A .) 
 Mr. Bernstein, with the Compensation Committee, continue to believe that the appropriate metric to consider in determining the amount of incentive compensation paid to all employees, including our NEOs, in respect of 2023 performance is the ratio of adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues, which terms are described immediately below : 
 Adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense is our total employee compensation and benefits expense minus other employment costs such as recruitment, training, temporary help and meals, and excludes the impact of mark-to-market vesting expense, as well as dividends and interest expense, associated with employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. Also, we adjust for certain performance-based fees passed through to our investment professionals. 
 Adjusted net revenues (see our discussion of Management Operating Metrics in Item 7 for a reconciliation between our results pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our adjusted results) exclude investment gains and losses and dividends and interest on employee long-term incentive compensation-related investments. In addition, adjusted net revenues offset distribution-related payments to third parties as well as amortization of deferred sales commissions against distribution revenues. We also exclude additional pass-through expenses we incur (primarily through our transfer agent) that are reimbursed and recorded as fees in revenues. Additionally, we adjust for the revenue impact of consolidating company-sponsored investment funds by eliminating the consolidated company-sponsored investment funds revenues and including AB s fees from such funds, and AB s investment gains and losses on its investment in such funds, that were eliminated in consolidation. We also adjust for certain acquisition-related pass-through performance-based fees and certain other performance-based fees passed through to our investment professionals.

 In addition, Mr. Bernstein, along with the Compensation Committee, continue to believe that the firm s adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense, excluding the impact of performance-based fees, generally should not exceed 50.0 of our adjusted net revenues annually, except in unexpected or unusual circumstances. As the table below indicates , in 2023, adjusted employee compensation and benefits expense amounted to approximately 49.0 of our adjusted net revenues (in thousands): 
 Net Revenues Adjustments see above 
 (783,374) Adjusted Net Revenues 3,371,949 Employee Compensation Benefits Expense Adjustments see above 
 (115,977) Adjusted Employee Compensation Benefits Expense 1,653,176 Adjusted Compensation Ratio 49.0 
 Our 2023 adjusted compensation ratio of approximately 49.0 reflects a balancing of the need to keep compensation levels competitive with industry peers in order to attract, motivate and retain highly-qualified talent with the need to maintain strong operating leverage in our business. The Compensation Committee works with management to help ensure both needs are sufficiently addressed.

 Compensation Committee; Process for Determining Executive Compensation 
 The Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Stonehill (Chair), Mr. Kaye and Mr. Pearson. The Compensation Committee held five regular meetings in 2023. 
 As discussed in NYSE Governance Matters in Item 10 , AB Holding, as a limited partnership, is exempt from NYSE rules that require public companies to have a compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors. EQH owns, directly and through various subsidiaries, an approximate 61.2 economic interest in AB (as of December 31, 2023), and compensation expense is a significant component of our financial results. For these reasons, Mr. Pearson, director and President and CEO of EQH, is a member of the Compensation Committee, and any action taken by the Compensation Committee requires his affirmative vote or consent. Given this structure, the Compensation Committee has established a sub-committee consisting entirely of non-management directors (i.e., Mr. Stonehill and Mr. Kaye). This Section 16 Sub-Committee approves awards of restricted AB Holding Units to NEOs to ensure we can utilize the short-swing trading exemption set forth in Section 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this exemption, equity grants to our firm's executive officers are exempt from short-swing trading rules if each such grant is approved by the full Board or a committee of the Board consisting entirely of non-employee directors (generally, directors who are not officers of the company or an affiliate). 
 The Compensation Committee has general oversight of compensation and compensation-related matters, including: 
 determining cash bonuses; 
 determining contributions and awards under incentive plans or other compensation arrangements (whether qualified or non-qualified) for employees of AB and its subsidiaries, and amending or terminating such plans or arrangements or any welfare benefit plan or arrangement or making recommendations to the Board with respect to adopting any new incentive compensation plan, including equity-based plans; 
 reviewing and approving the compensation of our CEO, evaluating his performance, and determining and approving his compensation level based on this evaluation; and 
 reviewing and discussing the CD A and recommending to the Board its inclusion in each of AB s and AB Holding s Form 10-K and, and when applicable, proxy statements. 
 The Compensation Committee has developed a comprehensive process for: 
 reviewing our executive compensation program to ensure it is aligned with our firm s philosophy and strategic objectives; 
 evaluating performance by our NEOs against goals and objectives established in each executive's performance scorecard at the beginning of the year; and 
 setting compensation for the NEOs and other senior executives. 
 The Compensation Committee s year-end process generally focuses on the cash bonuses and long-term incentive compensation awards granted to NEOs and other senior executives. Mr. Bernstein, working with the other senior executives, provides recommendations for individual executive awards to the Compensation Committee for its consideration. As part of this process, and as we discuss more fully below in " Compensation Consultant; Benchmarking Data ," Ms. Spencer provides the Compensation Committee with competitive market data from one or more compensation consultants. 
 Management periodically reviews, with the Compensation Committee, the firm s expected adjusted financial and operating results, the firm s actual adjusted financial and operating results and management s year-end compensation expectations, as they evolve throughout the year. Management accomplished these reviews during regular meetings of the Compensation Committee held in February, May, September, October and November 2023. The Compensation Committee approved the firm's final year-end compensation recommendations during its regular meeting held in November 2023. 
 Additional information regarding the Compensation Committee s functions can be found in the Committee's charter, which is available online in the Responsibility - Corporate Governance section of our Internet Site.

 Compensation Consultant; Benchmarking Data 
 In 2023, we retained McLagan Partners McLagan as an independent consultant to provide competitive market data and trend forecasting for our NEOs and other senior executives, for which we paid McLagan 60,000 (the " 2023 Benchmarking Data "). McLagan has an extensive database on compensation for most asset management companies, including private companies for which information is not otherwise available. 
 The 2023 Benchmarking Data summarized 2022 compensation levels and 2023 salaries, which helps form a reasonable estimation of compensation levels in the industry for executive positions like those held by our NEOs at selected asset management companies comparable to ours in terms of size and business mix (the Comparable Companies and, in so doing, assists in determining the appropriate level of compensation for our NEOs. 
 The Comparable Companies, which management selected with input from McLagan, included: 
 Barings Columbia Threadneedle Franklin Templeton Investments Goldman Sachs Asset Management Invesco Janus Henderson Investors Loomis, Sayles Company MFS Investment Management Morgan Stanley Investment Management Neuberger Berman Group Nuveen Investments Pacific Investment Management Prudential Global Investment Mgmt. Schroder Investment Management T. Rowe Price 
 The 2023 Benchmarking Data indicated that, as a group, our NEOs fall within market range. Please note that we excluded Ms. Burke from this analysis as she resigned from AB in May 2023 and, accordingly, did not receive year-end incentive compensation. 
 The Compensation Committee considered this information in concluding that the compensation levels paid in 2023 to our NEOs (other than Ms. Burke, who was not considered in this process given her resignation from the Company) were appropriate and reasonable. 
 Compensation Elements for NEOs 
 We utilize a variety of compensation elements to achieve the goals described above , consisting of base salary, annual short-term incentive compensation awards (cash bonuses), a long-term incentive compensation award program, a defined contribution plan, a defined benefit plan and certain other benefits, each of which we discuss below : 
 Base Salaries 
 Base salaries comprise a relatively small portion of our NEOs total compensation. We consider individual experience, responsibilities and tenure with the firm when determining the narrow range of base salaries paid to our NEOs please refer to Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement below for information relating to Mr. Bernstein s base salary and other compensation elements). 
 Annual Short-Term Incentive Compensation Awards (Cash Bonuses) 
 We provide our NEOs with annual short-term incentive compensation awards in the form of cash bonuses. 
 We believe that annual cash bonuses, which generally reflect individual performance and the firm s current year adjusted financial performance, provide a short-term retention mechanism for our NEOs because such bonuses typically are paid in December. 
 Annual cash bonuses in respect of 2023 performance for each NEO were determined in November 2023 and paid in December 2023. These bonuses, and the 2023 long-term incentive compensation awards described immediately below , were based on management s evaluation, subject to the Compensation Committee s review and approval, of each NEO s performance during the year, the firm's progress in advancing its Growth Strategy during the year, the performance of the NEO s business unit or function compared to business and operational goals established in each NEO's performance scorecard at the beginning of the year, and the firm s current-year adjusted financial performance. 
 In respect of 2023, Mr. Bernstein received a cash bonus of 4,515,000 in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement into which he entered with the General Partner, AB and AB Holding as of May 1, 2017 (the CEO Employment Agreement and after review of Mr. Bernstein's performance during 2023 by the Compensation Committee. Please refer to Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement below for additional information relating to Mr. Bernstein s cash bonus and other compensation elements.

 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards 
 Long-term incentive compensation awards generally are denominated in restricted AB Holding Units. We utilize this structure to align our NEOs long-term interests directly with the interests of our Unitholders and indirectly with the interests of our clients, as strong performance for our clients generally contributes directly to increases in AUM and improved financial performance for the firm. 
 We believe that annual long-term incentive compensation awards provide a long-term retention mechanism for our NEOs because such awards generally vest ratably over time; awards granted in 2022 and forward generally vest in equal portions over three years, while awards granted prior to 2021 generally vest over four years. We reduced the vesting period to three years for awards in 2021 to help ensure our compensation framework remains highly competitive. 
 For 2023 performance, awards were granted in December 2023 to each of Messrs. Bernstein, Siemers, Sprules, Erzan, and Manley pursuant to the AB 2023 Incentive Compensation Award Program (the " ICAP "), an unfunded, non-qualified incentive compensation plan, and the AB 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan, our equity compensation plan (the 2017 Plan ). Ms. Burke, who resigned in May 2023, did not receive an award. 
 Prior to the date on which an award vests, the AB Holding Units underlying an award are restricted and are not permitted to be transferred. Upon vesting, the AB Holding Units underlying an award generally are delivered, unless the award recipient has, in advance, voluntarily elected to defer receipt to future periods or the award is structured with a delayed delivery date. Quarterly cash distributions on vested and unvested restricted AB Holding Units are delivered to award recipients when cash distributions are paid generally to Unitholders. 
 An award recipient who resigns or is terminated without cause prior to the vesting date is eligible to continue to vest in his or her long-term incentive compensation award subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in the applicable award agreement, including restrictions on competition, and restrictions on employee and client solicitation. Additionally, the award agreement provides for continued vesting in the event of an award recipient's retirement, subject to applicable restrictive covenants. To be eligible for retirement, an award recipient must provide notice of retirement, enter into a retirement agreement and satisfy a "Rule of 70," whereby the sum of the recipient's age and full years of service must equal at least 70. 
 Clawbacks 
 The award agreement contained in the AB Incentive Compensation Award Program (" ICAP ") permits AB to claw-back the unvested portion of an award if the recipient fails to adhere to our risk management policies. As such, for accounting purposes, there is no employee service requirement and awards are fully expensed when granted. As used in this Item 11, vest refers to the time at which the awards are no longer subject to forfeiture for breach of these restrictions or risk management policies, which we discuss further below in Consideration of Risk Matters in Determining Compensation. 
 Further, pursuant to Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, the Board has adopted a Compensation Recovery Policy (the "Policy ") effective November 15, 2023. Pursuant to the Policy, the Company will promptly recover erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (as defined by section 10D(b)(1) to include any compensation that is granted, earned or vested wholly or in part upon attainment of a financial reporting measure) from any current or former Executive Officer of the Company as defined by Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act as required under the Exchange Act and the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The company does not currently award incentive-based compensation as defined by the Act. We have filed the Policy as Exhibit 97.01 to this Form 10-K. 
 The portion of incentive-based compensation received from EQH specific to Mr. Bernstein is covered under the Compensation Recovery Policy adopted by our parent EQH and will be applicable to any current or previous incentive-based compensation received directly from our parent company by Mr. Bernstein. See " Summary Compensation Table" EQH for stock awards received by Mr. Bernstein for which the EQH Compensation Recovery Policy is applicable. 
 Former COO and CFO Resignation 
 As announced in a Form 8-K filed on June 1, 2023, Ms. Burke resigned from AB on May 31, 2023. Her responsibilities as COO were promptly transferred to Mr. Sprules and her responsibilities as CFO were promptly transitioned to Mr. Siemers on an interim basis. 
 The compensatory benefits Ms. Burke forfeited by resigning included (i) unvested portions of prior-year long-term incentive compensation awards, aggregating to approximately 2.9 million in value (based on the closing price of an AB Holding Unit as of August 29, 2023, her official termination date taking into account the garden leave obligation provided in the ICAP award agreement); and (ii) the unvested portions of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards (at target) granted to her by EQH in connection with her membership on, and service to, EQH's Management Committee, aggregating to approximately 225,000 (based on the closing price of an EQH share as of August 29, 2023). 
 2023 Annual Report 139

 Defined Contribution Plan 
 U.S. employees of AB, including each of our NEOs, are eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of AB (as amended and restated as of January 1, 2015, and as further amended as of January 1, 2017, as of April 1, 2018, and as of June 28, 2022, the AB Profit Sharing Plan ), a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. The Compensation Committee determines the amount of company contributions (both the level of annual matching by the firm of an employee s pre-tax salary deferral contributions and the annual company profit sharing contribution, if any). 
 With respect to 2023, the Compensation Committee determined in November 2023 that employee deferral contributions would be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 5 of eligible compensation and that there would be no profit sharing contribution paid by AB. 
 Defined Benefit Plan 
 The retirement plan (the " Retirement Plan ") is a qualified, noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plan covering current and former employees who were employed in the United States prior to October 2, 2000. Each participant s benefits are determined under a formula which takes into account years of credited service through December 31, 2008, the participant s average compensation over prescribed periods and Social Security covered compensation. The maximum annual benefit payable under the Retirement Plan may not exceed the lesser of 100,000 or 100 of a participant s average aggregate compensation for the three consecutive years in which he or she received the highest aggregate compensation from us or such lower limit as may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " Code ") on certain participants by reason of their coverage under another qualified retirement plan we maintain. The Retirement Plan generally provides for payments to, or on behalf of, each vested employee upon such employee s retirement at the normal retirement age provided under the plan or later, although provision is made for payment of early retirement benefits on an "actuarially" reduced basis. Normal retirement age under the plan is 65. Death benefits are payable to the surviving spouse of an employee who dies with a vested benefit under the Retirement Plan. For additional information regarding interest rates and actuarial assumptions, see Note 18 to AB's consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 A participant in the Retirement Plan is eligible for early retirement upon termination of employment if the participant is at least age 55 and the sum of the participant s age and years of vesting service equals at least 80. As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Sprules has attained age 50 and earned 26 years of vesting service. (For purposes of determining early retirement eligibility, years of service after benefits under the Retirement Plan ceased accruing are included.) Because Mr. Sprules is younger than age 55 and the sum of his age and service is less than 80, he is not eligible for early retirement. As of December 31, 2023, Mr. Manley has attained age 61 and earned 40 years of vesting service. Because the total of Mr. Manley s age and years of service exceeded 80, he is eligible for early retirement. 
 The early retirement benefit is actuarially reduced for each month that payments begin before age 65. The reduction to the pension is made because it costs more money to provide payments over a longer period of time. In other words, the monthly benefit commencing at the early retirement date has the same value as a monthly benefit beginning at age 65. The actuarial adjustment factors are based on the mortality assumptions specified under Section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a 6 interest rate, as specified in the Retirement Plan. For example, a 60 year old participant would receive approximately 66 of the accrued benefit that would have been payable at age 65. 
 Other Benefits 
 Change in Control Plan 
 In December 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the AllianceBernstein Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers (the " CIC Plan "). The purpose of the CIC Plan is to provide certain benefits for each individual designated by our CEO as an executive officer (an " Executive Officer ") in the event of a change in control (" CIC ") of AB. The CIC Plan contains a change in control provision substantially similar to the change in control provision included in Mr. Bernstein's employment agreement as described below in "Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreemen t"). The provisions under the CIC Plan also are described in a compensatory table below entitled, Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. 
 The CIC Plan provides that, in the event of a CIC, unless prior to the CIC, any unvested restricted unit awards (including ICAP awards) then held by an Executive Officer are honored or assumed, or new rights are substituted therefore, so that the Executive Officer's rights and entitlements after the CIC are substantially equivalent to or better than the Executives Officer's rights and entitlements under the award, each award will, prior to the CIC, immediately and fully vest and no longer be subject to forfeiture. 
 In addition, (i) if the Executive Officer's employment is terminated by AB, other than for cause, (ii) the Executive Officer resigns with good reason (as defined in the CIC Plan), or (iii) the Executive Officer dies or becomes disabled, within 12 months following a CIC, the Executive Officer will be entitled to receive the sum of (a) the Executives Officer's annual base salary at the time of his or her termination, and (b) the Executive Officer's most recent annual cash incentive compensation award, multiplied by two.

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 The CIC Plan defines CIC to include any transaction as a result of which EQH ceases to control AB, or a successor entity that conducts the business of AB. However, there would not be a CIC unless, as a result of the transaction, an entity other than EQH controls AB (or a successor to its business). 
 Life Insurance 
 Our firm pays the premiums associated with life insurance policies purchased on behalf of our NEOs. 
 Consideration of Risk Matters in Determining Compensation 
 In 2023, we considered whether our compensation practices for employees, including our NEOs, encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and whether any risks arising from our compensation practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our firm. For the reasons set forth below , we have determined that our current compensation practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our firm. 
 As described above in Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards, long-term incentive compensation awards generally are denominated in AB Holding Units that are not distributed until subsequent years, so the ultimate value that the employee derives from the award depends on the long-term performance of the firm. Denominating the award in restricted AB Holding Units and deferring their delivery is intended to sensitize employees to risk outcomes and discourage them from taking excessive risks, whether relating to investments, operations, regulatory compliance and/or cyber security, that could lead to a decrease in the value of the AB Holding Units and/or an adverse effect on the firm's long-term prospects. Furthermore, and as noted above in Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards, generally all outstanding long-term incentive compensation awards include a provision permitting us to claw-back the unvested portion of an employee s long-term incentive compensation award if the Compensation Committee determines that (i) the employee failed to adhere to existing risk management policies and (ii) as a result of the employee s failure, there has been or reasonably could be expected to be a material adverse impact on our firm or the employee s business unit. 
 Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement 
 Pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Bernstein served as our President and CEO for an initial term that commenced on May 1, 2017 and ended on May 1, 2020. The initial term automatically was extended for one additional year on May 1, 2020 and automatically extends each May thereafter, unless the CEO Employment Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (the Employment Term ). 
 The terms of the CEO Employment Agreement were the result of arm s length negotiations between Mr. Bernstein and senior executives at AXA S.A., formerly AB's ultimate parent company (" AXA "), and EQH. The Board then approved the CEO Employment Agreement after having considered, among other things, the compensation package provided to Mr. Bernstein s predecessor, the 2016 compensation and 2017 expected compensation of AB s other executive officers and Mr. Bernstein s compensation at his former employer. 
 The Compensation Committee, during its regular meeting held in December 2018, amended the CEO Employment Agreement such that any annual equity award granted to Mr. Bernstein in 2018 and subsequent years during the Employment Term will be granted in all respects in accordance with AB's compensation practices and policies generally applicable to AB's executive officers as in effect from time to time (the " SPB First Amendment "). 
 Additionally, the Compensation Committee, during its regular meeting held in December 2019, further amended the CEO Employment Agreement by: 
 increasing Mr. Bernstein s severance payments if his employment is terminated involuntarily, without cause, from one year s base salary and bonus to one and a half year s base salary and bonus; 
 excluding from the definition of change in control AB Holding ceasing to be publicly traded; 
 removing from the circumstances that give rise to Mr. Bernstein s ability to terminate the agreement for good reason his ceasing to be the CEO of a publicly traded entity; and 
 eliminating Mr. Bernstein s entitlement to a gross-up for any excise tax on his parachute payments, which would have been pertinent only if Mr. Bernstein had been terminated involuntarily prior to December 31, 2019. 
 Elements of Mr. Bernstein s Compensation 
 Base Salary 
 Mr. Bernstein s annual base salary under the CEO Employment Agreement has been, and continues to be, 500,000. This amount is consistent with our firm s policy to keep base salaries of executives and other highly-compensated employees low in relation to total compensation. Any future increase to Mr. Bernstein's base salary is entirely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
 2023 Annual Report 141 

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 Cash Bonus 
 Under the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Bernstein is entitled to be paid a cash bonus at a target level of 3,000,000 in each year during the Employment Term, subject to review and increase from time to time by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion. As a result of a review of Mr. Bernstein's performance during 2023 by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Bernstein was paid a cash bonus of 4,515,000. In determining Mr. Bernstein's cash bonus, the Compensation Committee considered the progress AB made in advancing its Growth Strategy, Mr. Bernstein's performance in light of the target metrics included in his performance scorecard and Mr. Bernstein's individual achievements during 2023, as described above . 
 Restricted AB Holding Units 
 Commencing in 2018 and during the remainder of the Employment Term, Mr. Bernstein is eligible to receive annual equity awards with a grant date fair value equal to 3,500,000, subject to review and increase by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, in accordance with AB s compensation practices and policies generally applicable to the firm s executive officers as in effect from time to time. The Compensation Committee approved an equity award to Mr. Bernstein with a grant date fair value equal to 4,165,000 during November 2023. The Compensation Committee determined Mr. Bernstein's equity award based on the review process described above . As a result of the SPB First Amendment, the equity award granted to Mr. Bernstein in December 2023 is subject to the same ICAP-related terms and conditions as awards granted to other executive officers at that time, which terms and conditions are described above in "Compensation Elements for NEOs - Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards." 
 Perquisites and Benefits 
 Under the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Bernstein is eligible to participate in all benefit plans available to executive officers and, for his safety and accessibility, a company car and driver for business and personal use. 
 Severance and Change in Control Benefits 
 The CEO Employment Agreement includes severance and change-in-control provisions, which are highlighted below . These provisions also are described in a compensatory table below entitled, Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. We believe that these severance and change-in-control provisions assist in retaining our CEO and, in the event of a change in control, provide protection to Mr. Bernstein so he is not distracted by personal or financial situations at a time when AB needs him to remain focused on his responsibilities. 
 If Mr. Bernstein is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the CEO Employment Agreement), and he signs and does not revoke a waiver and release of claims, he will receive the following: 
 A cash payment equal to (a) the sum of his current base salary and his bonus opportunity amount, multiplied by one (1), if Mr. Bernstein resigns for "good reason," or (b) the sum of his current base salary and his bonus opportunity amount, multiplied by one and a half (1.5), if Mr. Bernstein's employment is terminated other than for "cause," or because of his death or disability; 
 a pro rata bonus based on actual performance for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs; 
 monthly payments equal to the cost of COBRA coverage for the COBRA coverage period; and 
 following the COBRA coverage period, access to participation in AB s medical plans as in effect from time to time at Mr. Bernstein s (or his spouse s) sole expense. 
 If, during the 12 months following a change in control, Mr. Bernstein is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, he will receive the amounts described above , except that he will receive a cash payment equal to two (2) times the sum of his current base salary and his bonus opportunity amount. 
 In the event any payments constitute golden parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would be subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, such payments will be reduced to the maximum amount that does not result in the imposition of such excise tax, but only if such reduction results in Mr. Bernstein receiving a higher net-after tax amount than he would receive absent such reduction. 
 Mr. Bernstein is subject to a confidentiality provision, in addition to covenants with respect to non-competition during his employment and six months thereafter and non-solicitation of customers and employees for 12 months following his termination of employment. 
 A change in control is defined as, among other things, EQH and its majority-owned subsidiaries ceasing to control the election of a majority of the Board.

 AllianceBernstein 

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 Mr. Bernstein negotiated the severance and change-in-control provisions described immediately above to have the security and flexibility to focus on the business and preserve the value of his long-term incentive compensation. The Board, AXA and EQH determined that these provisions were reasonable and appropriate because they were necessary to recruit and retain Mr. Bernstein and provided Mr. Bernstein with effective incentives for future performance. 
 The Board, AXA and EQH also concluded that the change-in-control and termination provisions in the CEO Employment Agreement fit within AB s overall compensation objectives because these provisions, which align with AB s goal of providing its executives with effective incentives for future performance, also: 
 permitted AB to recruit and retain a highly-qualified CEO; 
 aligned Mr. Bernstein s long-term interests with those of AB s Unitholders and clients; 
 were consistent with AXA s, EQH's and the Board s expectations with respect to the manner in which AB and AB Holding would be operated during Mr. Bernstein s tenure; and 
 were consistent with the Board s expectations that Mr. Bernstein would not be terminated without cause and that no steps would be taken that would provide him with the ability to terminate the agreement for good reason. 
 Compensation awarded by EQH to Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Erzan and Ms. Burke 
 In February 2023, EQH granted to Mr. Bernstein, in connection with his membership on and service to the EQH Management Committee: 
 a restricted stock unit award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 332,029; and 
 a performance share award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 498,025, which can be earned subject to EQH s total shareholder return relative to its peer group. 
 Additionally, in February 2023, EQH granted to each of Mr. Erzan and Ms. Burke, in connection with their membership on and service to the EQH Management Committee: 
 a restricted stock unit award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 40,024; and 
 a performance share award (for EQH common stock) with a grant date fair value of 60,012, which can be earned subject to EQH s total shareholder return relative to its peer group. 
 Assumptions made in determining the EQH restricted stock unit and performance share figures discussed above are described in footnotes to the compensatory tables below entitled " Summary Compensation Table for 2023 " and "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2023." 
 Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Erzan may receive additional equity or cash compensation from EQH in the future related to their continued membership on and service to the EQH Management Committee. Ms. Burke, who resigned as our firm's COO and CFO in May 2023 (and from the EQH Management Committee), forfeited her awards and is ineligible for additional awards. 
 CEO Pay Ratio 
 In 2023, the compensation of Mr. Bernstein, our President and CEO, was approximately 65 times the median pay of our employees, resulting in a 65:1 CEO Pay Ratio. 
 We identified our median employee by examining 2023 total compensation for all individuals, excluding Mr. Bernstein, who were employed by our firm as of December 31, 2023, the last day of our payroll year. We included all of our employees in this process, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. We did not make any assumptions or estimates with respect to total compensation, but we did adjust compensation paid to our non-U.S. employees during our 2023 fiscal year based on the average monthly exchange rates for the three-month period ending September 30, 2023 (data compiled in fourth quarter) between the local currencies in which such employees are paid and U.S. dollars. We define total compensation as the aggregate of base salary (plus overtime, as applicable), commissions (as applicable), cash bonus and the grant date fair value of long-term incentive compensation awards. 
 After identifying the median employee based on total compensation, we calculated total compensation in 2023 for such employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth below in the Summary Compensation Table for 2023 .

 Other Compensation-Related Matters 
 AB and AB Holding are, respectively, private and public limited partnerships. They are subject to taxes other than federal and state corporate income tax (see Structure-related Risks in Item 1A and Note 21 to AB s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ). Accordingly, Section 162(m) of the Code, which limits tax deductions relating to executive compensation otherwise available to an entity taxed as a corporation, is not applicable to either AB or AB Holding for 2023. 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 Mr. Pearson is a director and the President and CEO of EQH, the parent company of the General Partner. 
 No executive officer of AB serves as (i) a member of a compensation committee or (ii) a director of another entity, an executive officer of which serves as a member of AB s Compensation Committee.

 (1) This column provides the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For the assumptions made in determining the AB Holding Unit values, see Note 19 to AB's consolidated financial statements in Item 8 . 
 (2) As discussed above in Overview of 2023 Incentive Compensation Program and Compensation Elements for NEOs Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards, long-term incentive compensation awards granted in December 2023 to our NEOs were denominated in restricted AB Holding Units. These awards vest in equal annual increments on each of December 1, 2024, 2025 and 2026. These awards are shown in the All Other Stock Awards column of this table, the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2023 and the AB Holding Unit and/or EQH Awards columns of the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End Table. 
 (3) In February 2023, EQH granted to each of Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Erzan and Ms. Burke (i) a restricted stock unit award with a grant date fair value of 332,029, 40,024, and 40,024, respectively, and (ii) a performance share award with a grant date fair value of 498,025, 60,012, and 60,012, respectively, which can be earned subject to EQH's total stockholder return (" TSR ") relative to its peer group. TSR is the total amount a company returns to investors during a designated period, including both share price appreciation and dividends. The number of performance shares that are earned, which cliff vest on February 28, 2026, subject to continued service, will be determined at the end of the performance period (December 2025) by multiplying the number of unearned performance shares by one of the following performance factors: 200 if EQH's TSR relative to its peers is in the 87.5 th percentile or greater; 100 if in the 50 th percentile; 25 if in the 30 th percentile; and nothing if falls below the 30 th percentile. EQH performance shares receive dividend equivalents subject to the same vesting schedule and performance conditions as the performance shares themselves. The restricted stock unit awards, which vest in equal annual increments on each of February 28, 2024, 2025 and 2026, subject to continued service, increase or decrease in value depending on the price of an EQH common share. EQH restricted stock units receive dividend equivalents subject to the same vesting schedule as the restricted stock units themselves. 
 (4) Ms. Burke forfeited these awards. 
 In 2023, the number of restricted AB Holding Units comprising year-end long-term incentive compensation awards granted to each NEO was determined based on the closing price of an AB Holding Unit as reported for NYSE composite transactions on December 12, 2023, the date as of which the Compensation Committee approved the awards. At the time of these awards, the Compensation Committee consisted of Mr. Stonehill (Chair) and Messrs. Kaye and Pearson; the Section 16 Subcommittee, which approved awards to our NEOs, consisted of Mr. Stonehill (Chair) and Mr. Kaye. For further information regarding the material terms of such awards, including the vesting terms and the formulas or criteria to be applied in determining the amounts payable, please refer to " Overview of 2023 Incentive Compensation Program " and " Compensation Elements for NEOs " above.

For further information, see Overview of Mr. Bernstein's Employment Agreement above. 
 (2) EQH restricted stock unit awards, which are described for Mr. Bernstein in the second line of data in the above table, will vest ratably over their three-year vesting period subject to continued employment during the vesting period. EQH performance share awards, which are described in the third line of data in the above table, cliff vest on the third anniversary of grant date subject to continued employment during the vesting period and meeting the applicable performance criteria. In February 2023, 2022 and 2021, EQH granted to Mr. Bernstein (i) a restricted stock unit award with a grant date fair value of 332,029, 400,033 and 340,000, respectively, and (ii) a performance share award with a grant date fair value of 498,025, 600,029 and 510,000, respectively.

Please see the table above entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2023" for additional information regarding the EQH awards. 
 (3) The option awards described in the table were issued by EQH and calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of EQH stock options is calculated by EQH using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected EQH dividend rate is based on market consensus. EQH share price volatility is estimated on the basis of implied volatility, which is checked by EQH against an analysis of historical volatility to ensure consistency. The effect of expected early exercise is accounted for through the use of an expected life assumption based on historical data. 
 (4) EQH restricted stock unit awards, which are described for Mr. Erzan in the second line of data in the above table, will vest ratably over their three-year vesting period subject to continued employment during the vesting period. EQH performance share awards, which are described in the third line of data in the above table, cliff vest on the third anniversary of grant date subject to continued employment during the vesting period and meeting the applicable performance criteria. In February 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, EQH granted to Mr. Erzan (i) a restricted stock unit award with a grant date fair value of 40,024, 40,021 and 40,000, respectively and (ii) a performance share award with a grant date fair value of 60,012, 60,014 and 60,000, respectively, which can be earned subject to EQH's total shareholder return relative to its peer group. Please see the table above entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2023" for additional information regarding the EQH awards.

 (1) It is possible that each NEO could receive a cash severance payment on the termination of his or her employment that is not contemplated in the CIC Plan. The amounts of any such cash severance payments would be determined at the time of such termination (other than for Mr. Bernstein), so we are unable to estimate such amounts. The amounts shown for Mr. Bernstein are described in the CEO Employment Agreement. The amounts shown for Mr. Siemers, Mr. Sprules, Mr. Erzan, and Mr. Manley in the event of a change in control coupled with termination of employment are described in the CIC Plan.

 (6) Under the CEO Employment Agreement, upon termination of Mr. Bernstein s employment due to death or disability, and after the COBRA period, AB will provide Mr. Bernstein and his spouse with access to participation in AB s medical plans at Mr. Bernstein s (or his spouse s) sole expense based on a reasonably determined fair market value premium rate. 
 (7) Disability is defined in the ICAP award agreements of each NEO as the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as determined by the carrier of the long-term disability insurance program maintained by AB or its affiliate that covers the NEO. 
 (8) Applicable agreements and restrictive covenants in the ICAP award agreement include restrictions on competition and restrictions on employee and client solicitation. 
 (9) Ms. Burke resigned as our firm's COO and CFO in May 2023, so she was ineligible for any potential payment or benefit upon a change in control of AB as of December 31, 2023.

 Independent Director Compensation Elements 
 The Board approved the compensation elements described immediately below for Independent Directors during its regular meeting held in May 2023 and has agreed to re-consider such compensation elements bi-annually: 
 an annual retainer of 90,000 (paid quarterly after any quarter during which an Independent Director serves on the Board; annual retainers relating to Committee service, as described below, are paid quarterly in arrears as well); 
 an annual retainer of 50,000 for acting as Independent Chair of the Board; 
 an annual retainer of 37,500 for acting as Chair of the Audit Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 20,000 for acting as Chair of the Compensation Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 13,500 for acting as Chair of the Governance Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 12,500 for serving as a member of the Audit Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 9,000 for serving as a member of the Compensation Committee; 
 an annual retainer of 3,000 for serving as a member of the Governance Committee; and 
 an annual equity-based grant under an equity compensation plan consisting of restricted AB Holding Units with a grant date fair value of 170,000. 
 In 2023, the Board granted to each Independent Director then serving (which included Mses. Domenici and Lamm-Tennant and Messrs. Kaye, Narayandas, Stonehill and Walthall) 5,017 restricted AB Holding Units. The number of AB Holding Units granted was determined by dividing the 170,000 grant date fair value noted above by the closing price of an AB Holding Unit on the date of the May 2023 Board Meeting, or 33.89 per unit, rounded up to the nearest whole unit. These awards vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. 
 Further, in order to avoid any perception that our directors exercise of their fiduciary duties might be impaired, restricted AB Holding Unit grants to Independent Directors are not forfeitable, except if the director is terminated for Cause, as that term is defined in the 2017 Plan or the applicable award agreement. Accordingly, restricted AB Holding Units generally are delivered as soon as administratively feasible following an Independent Director s resignation from the Board. 
 Equity grants to Independent Directors generally are made at the May meeting of the Board. The date of the May meeting is set by the Board at least a year in advance.

 The General Partner may reimburse any director for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attendance at Board meetings as well as additional Board responsibilities. AB Holding and AB, in turn, reimburse the General Partner for expenses incurred by the General Partner on their behalf, including amounts in respect of directors fees and expenses. These reimbursements are subject to any relevant provisions of the AB Holding Partnership Agreement and the AB Partnership Agreement. 
 Independent Director AB Holding Unit Ownership Guidelines 
 Each Independent Director, by the later of five years from the initial implementation date of these guidelines (February 2018) and the date as of which the director's tenure on the Board begins, shall accumulate, either through accumulating AB Holding Units awarded by the Board or purchasing Units on the open market, AB Holding Units with a market value equal to five (5) times the director's annual retainer. Each Independent Director must maintain this ownership level for the duration of the director's tenure on the Board. 
 As of December 31, 2023, each Independent Director then serving either complied with this policy or was on track to do so within the allotted time.

 Partnership Matters 
 The General Partner makes all decisions relating to the management of AB and AB Holding. The General Partner has agreed that it will conduct no business other than managing AB and AB Holding, although it may make certain investments for its own account. Conflicts of interest, however, could arise between AB and AB Holding, the General Partner and the Unitholders of both Partnerships. 
 Section 17-403(b) of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act Delaware Act states in substance that, except as provided in the Delaware Act or the applicable partnership agreement, a general partner of a limited partnership has the liabilities of a general partner in a general partnership governed by the Delaware Uniform Partnership Law (as in effect on July 11, 1999) to the partnership and to the other partners. In addition, as discussed below , Sections 17-1101(d) and 17-1101(f) of the Delaware Act generally provide that a partnership agreement may limit or eliminate fiduciary duties a partner may be deemed to owe to the limited partnership or to another partner, and any related liability, provided that the partnership agreement may not limit or eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, while under Delaware law a general partner of a limited partnership is liable as a fiduciary to the other partners, those fiduciary obligations may be altered by the terms of the applicable partnership agreement. Each of the AB Partnership Agreement and AB Holding Partnership Agreement (each, a Partnership Agreement and, together, the Partnership Agreements sets forth limitations on the duties and liabilities of the General Partner. Each Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner is not liable for monetary damages for errors in judgment or for breach of fiduciary duty (including breach of any duty of care or loyalty), unless it is established (the person asserting such liability having the burden of proof) that the General Partner s action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury, with reckless disregard for the best interests of the Partnerships or with actual bad faith on the part of the General Partner, or constituted actual fraud. Whenever the Partnership Agreements provide that the General Partner is permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its discretion or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the General Partner is entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires and has no duty or obligation to consider any interest of or other factors affecting the Partnerships or any Unitholder of AB or AB Holding or (ii) in its good faith or under another express standard, the General Partner will act under that express standard and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by either Partnership Agreement or applicable law or in equity or otherwise. Each Partnership Agreement further provides that to the extent that, at law or in equity, the General Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to either Partnership or any partner, the General Partner acting under either Partnership Agreement, as applicable, will not be liable to the Partnerships or any partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of the Partnership Agreement. 
 In addition, each Partnership Agreement grants broad rights of indemnification to the General Partner and its directors, officers and affiliates and authorizes AB and AB Holding to enter into indemnification agreements with the directors, officers, partners, employees and agents of AB and its affiliates and AB Holding and its affiliates. The Partnerships have granted broad rights of indemnification to officers and employees of AB and AB Holding. The foregoing indemnification provisions are not exclusive, and the Partnerships are authorized to enter into additional indemnification arrangements. AB and AB Holding have obtained directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance. 
 Each Partnership Agreement also allows transactions between AB and AB Holding and the General Partner or its affiliates, as we describe in Policies and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons in Item 13, so long as such transactions are on an arms-length basis. The Delaware courts have held that provisions in partnership or limited liability company agreements that permit affiliate transactions so long as they are on an arms-length basis operate to establish a contractually-agreed-to fiduciary duty standard of entire fairness on the part of the general partner or manager in connection with the approval of affiliate transactions. Also, each Partnership Agreement expressly permits all affiliates of the General Partner to compete, directly or indirectly, with AB and AB Holding, as we discuss in Competition in Item 1 . The Partnership Agreements further provide that, except to the extent that a decision or action by the General Partner is taken with the specific intent of providing an improper benefit to an affiliate of the General Partner to the detriment of AB or AB Holding, there is no liability or obligation with respect to, and no challenge of, decisions or actions of the General Partner that would otherwise be subject to claims or other challenges as improperly benefiting affiliates of the General Partner to the detriment of the Partnerships or otherwise involving any conflict of interest or breach of a duty of loyalty or similar fiduciary obligation. 
 Section 17-1101(c) of the Delaware Act provides that it is the policy of the Delaware Act to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract and to the enforceability of partnership agreements. Further, Section 17-1101(d) of the Delaware Act provides in part that to the extent that, at law or in equity, a partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) to a limited partnership or to another partner, those duties may be expanded, restricted, or eliminated by provisions in a partnership agreement (provided that a partnership agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing). In addition, Section 17-1101(f) of the Delaware Act provides that a partnership agreement may limit or eliminate any or all liability of a partner to a limited partnership or another partner for breach of contract or breach of duties (including fiduciary duties); provided, however, that a partnership agreement may not limit or eliminate liability for any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Decisions of the Delaware courts have recognized the right of parties, under the above provisions of the Delaware Act, to alter by the terms of a partnership agreement otherwise applicable fiduciary duties and liability for breach of duties. However, the Delaware courts 
 2023 Annual Report 159 

Table of Contents 
 Part III 

 have required that a partnership agreement make clear the intent of the parties to displace otherwise applicable fiduciary duties (the otherwise applicable fiduciary duties often being referred to as default fiduciary duties). Judicial inquiry into whether a partnership agreement is sufficiently clear to displace default fiduciary duties is necessarily fact driven and is made on a case by case basis. Accordingly, the effectiveness of displacing default fiduciary obligations and liabilities of general partners continues to be a developing area of the law and it is not certain to what extent the foregoing provisions of the Partnership Agreements are enforceable under Delaware law. 
 
 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 
 Policies and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
 Each Partnership Agreement expressly permits EQH and its subsidiaries (collectively, EQH Affiliates ), to provide services to AB and AB Holding if the terms of the transaction are approved by the General Partner in good faith as being comparable to (or more favorable to each such Partnership than) those that would prevail in a transaction with an unaffiliated party. This requirement is conclusively presumed to be satisfied as to any transaction or arrangement that (i) in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the General Partner meets that unaffiliated party standard, or (ii) has been approved by a majority of those directors of the General Partner who are not also directors, officers or employees of an affiliate of the General Partner. 
 In practice, our management pricing committees review investment advisory agreements with EQH Affiliates, which is the manner in which the General Partner reaches a judgment regarding the appropriateness of the fees. Other transactions with EQH Affiliates are submitted to the Audit Committee for their review and approval. See Committees of the Board in Item 10 for details regarding the Audit Committee.) We are not aware of any transaction during 2023 between our company and any related person with respect to which these procedures were not followed. 
 Our relationships with EQH Affiliates also are subject to applicable provisions of the insurance laws and regulations of New York and other states. Under such laws and regulations, the terms of certain investment advisory and other agreements we enter into with EQH Affiliates are required to be fair and equitable and charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable. Also, in some cases, the agreements are subject to regulatory approval. 
 We have written policies regarding the employment of immediate family members of any of our related persons. Compensation and benefits for all of our employees is established in accordance with our people practices, taking into consideration the defined qualifications, responsibilities and nature of the role. 
 Financial Arrangements with EQH Affiliates 
 The General Partner has, in its reasonable and good faith judgment (based on its knowledge of, and inquiry with respect to, comparable arrangements with or between unaffiliated parties), approved the following arrangements with EQH Affiliates as being comparable to, or more favorable to AB than, those that would prevail in a transaction with an unaffiliated party.

The independent registered public accounting firm must provide annually a comprehensive and detailed schedule of each proposed audit and non-audit service to be performed. The Audit Committee then affirmatively indicates its approval of the listed engagements. Engagements that are not listed but that are of similar scope and size to those listed and approved may be deemed to be approved, if the fee for such service is less than 100,000. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman the ability to approve any permissible non-audit engagement where the fees are expected to be less than 100,000.

DESCRIPTION OF ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN UNITS AND 
 ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN HOLDING L.P. UNITS 

General 
 
 Interests in AllianceBernstein L.P. ABLP are in the form of units of limited partnership interest ABLP units ). Interests in AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. AB Holding are in the form of units representing assignments of beneficial ownership of limited partnership interests AB Holding units ). AB Holding is the record owner of a number of ABLP units equal to the number of AB Holding units then outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, there were 114,436,091 AB Holding units outstanding and 286,609,212 ABLP units outstanding. 
 
 The Board of Directors (the GP Board of AllianceBernstein Corporation, the general partner, controls the activities of both AB Holding and ABLP. The Board is not classified. Unitholders of ABLP and AB Holding do not have the right to vote for members of the GP Board. The right to appoint members of the GP Board rests with Alpha Units Holdings, Inc. Alpha ), the sole stockholder of the general partner. Alpha is a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitable Holdings, Inc. EQH ). The common stock of EQH trades publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EQH. 
 
 Among other rights, Delaware law gives limited partners the right to maintain a derivative action, the right to exercise voting powers and the right to inspect and copy a partnership's books and records. The respective Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership of ABLP and AB Holding also grant limited partners such rights. 
 
 The general partner may, without the consent of the limited partners, amend either partnership agreement to qualify the partnership as a limited partnership or to preserve the limited liability of limited 
 partners. 
 
 ABLP units do not trade publicly and are subject to significant transfer restrictions. AB Holding units trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AB. 
 
 Restrictions on Transfers of ABLP Units 
 
 As noted above, ABLP units are subject to significant liquidity restrictions. In general, transfers of ABLP units are allowed only with the written consent of both EQH and ABLP s general partner. Only the written consent of EQH, and not the written consent of the general partner, is required for a block transfer, as described below, of units by a corporation or other business entity, provided that the partnership has received an opinion of counsel to the effect that the partnership will not be treated as a publicly traded partnership for tax purposes as a result of the transfer. Either EQH or, where applicable, the general partner may withhold its consent to a transfer in its sole discretion, for any reason. Generally, neither EQH nor the general partner will permit any transfer that it believes would create a risk that ABLP would be treated as a corporation for tax purposes. 
 
 ABLP does not recognize any transfer made without the appropriate consents. 
 
 EQH and the general partner may refuse to consent to any transfer that is not described in the safe harbors set forth in United States Treasury regulations. This fact does not imply, however, that either EQH or the general partner necessarily intends to permit transfers that are described in the safe harbors. Neither EQH, where relevant, the general partner is required to approve any transfer, and there can be no assurance that EQH or the general partner will approve a transfer even if the transfer would be permissible under the safe harbors. Permissible transfers under the safe harbors may include 

(1) transfers at death 
 
 (2) transfers between certain family members and 
 
 (3) block transfers. 
 
 In general, a block transfer is the transfer within a 30-day period by a single holder, or group of related holders, of ABLP units representing more than 2 of the outstanding ABLP units. For these purposes, units held by EQH and its affiliates, other than AB Holding, will not be counted as outstanding. 
 
 Unitholders Have No Right to Direct the Business of AB Holding or ABLP 
 
 The activities of AB Holding and ABLP are managed and controlled by the general partner. The general partner has agreed that it will conduct no active business other than managing AB Holding and ABLP, although it may make certain investments for its own account. Neither AB Holding unitholders nor ABLP unitholders have any rights to manage or control AB Holding or ABLP, or, as noted above, to elect directors of the general partner. 
 
 Change in Control 
 
 As noted above, the general partner controls the activities of AB Holding and ABLP, and the general partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQH. Accordingly, any change in control of AB Holding or ABLP would require a sale by EQH of its interest in the general partner and consent of EQH. 
 
 Comparison of ABLP and AB Holding Unitholder Rights 
 
 Set forth below is a comparison of AB Holding units and ABLP units. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the respective Amended and Restated Agreements of Limited Partnership of ABLP and AB Holding, each of which can be found on our firm s website, www.alliancebernstein.com. 
 
 Under Delaware law and the Partnership Agreements, ABLP unitholders and AB Holding unitholders have substantially similar voting rights. 
 
 The general partner may not be removed by AB Holding unitholders unless it is not, or is simultaneously removed as, the general partner of ABLP. The general partner also may not withdraw unless it is not, or simultaneously withdraws as, the general partner of both AB Holding and ABLP. 
 
 Voting Rights 
 
 AB Holding and ABLP unitholders generally have voting rights with respect to 
 
 1. the withdrawal, removal, transfer and replacement of the general partner 
 
 1. the merger or consolidation of AB Holding or ABLP with another entity, 
 
 1. the sale of all or substantially all of the assets owned, directly or indirectly, by either AB Holding or ABLP 

1. the dissolution of either AB Holding or ABLP 
 
 1. certain types of amendments to the Partnership Agreements 
 
 1. reconstitution of AB Holding or ABLP 
 
 1. election, compensation and approval of a liquidating trustee 
 
 1. conversion or reorganization of AB Holding or ABLP into another type of legal entity 
 
 1. issuance of units that rank senior to the originally issued AB Holding units or ABLP units, as the case may be. 
 
 Each AB Holding unit and ABLP unit entitles the holder thereof to cast one vote on all matters presented to unitholders. 
 
 Approval of any matter submitted to unitholders generally requires the affirmative vote of unitholders holding more than 50 of the units then outstanding, except that 
 
 1. any transfer by the general partner of all or substantially all of AB Holding s or ABLP s assets where the general partner or its corporate affiliates have any direct or indirect equity interest in the person acquiring the partnership requires a vote of more than 50 of AB Holding or ABL unitholders, excluding employees of ABLP, their families, the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 1. withdrawal of the general partner requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 1. removal of the general partner without cause requires the vote of 80 of the outstanding units 
 
 1. except in limited circumstances, an election by the general partner to dissolve AB Holding or ABLP requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 1. in certain circumstances upon which AB Holding or ABLP would otherwise be dissolved, a unanimous vote of the unitholders to continue the business of the partnership is necessary to avoid dissolution 
 
 1. any amendment that would adversely alter the rights and preferences of AB Holding or ABLP units requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates 
 
 1. any amendment that would adversely alter the rights and preference of any other class or series of units must be approved by a majority of that class and 
 
 1. any amendment for which AB Holding or ABLP does not receive a determination that as a result of such amendment 
 
 a. the unitholders would not lose their limited liability pursuant to Delaware law or the applicable Partnership Agreement 

a. the partnership would not become subject to federal income tax or otherwise incur additional tax liabilities and 
 
 a. certain advisory contracts of ABLP would not automatically be terminated or breached 
 
 requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the units other than the general partner and its corporate affiliates. 
 
 Only the general partner may propose amendments to either the ABLP Partnership Agreement or the AB Holding Partnership Agreement. 
 
 Any action that may be taken at a meeting of unitholders of AB Holding or ABLP may be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting executed by unitholders of AB Holding or ABLP sufficient to authorize such action at a meeting of unitholders. 
 
 Distributions Taxation 
 
 AB Holding and ABLP each is required under its Partnership Agreement to distribute its available cash flow. 
 
 AB Holding is subject to a 3.5 federal tax on its gross business income. Otherwise, AB Holding is not subject to federal or state income tax. Rather, unitholders include their respective shares of AB Holding s income, gain, losses, deductions and credits in computing taxable income, without regard to the cash distributed to unitholders quarterly. Generally, cash distributions are not taxable, unless distributions 
 exceed a unitholder s basis in units. 
 
 ABLP is not subject to the 3.5 federal tax, or any corresponding state tax, on its gross business income. Otherwise, its tax treatment identical to the tax treatment of AB Holding. 
 
 For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, each ABLP unit will be paid 0.85 per unit, while each AB Holding unitholder will be paid 0.77 per unit. The difference in distribution rate primarily results from applicability of the 3.5 federal tax described immediately above. 
 
 Meetings 
 
 Meetings of AB Holding unitholders may be called for any purpose with respect to which the unitholders are entitled to vote. Such meetings may be called by the general partner or by unitholders holding at least 50 of the issued and outstanding AB Holding units. 
 
 Meetings of ABLP unitholders may be called for any purpose with respect to which the unitholders are entitled to vote. Such meetings may be called by the general partner, by unitholders holding at least 25 of the issued and outstanding ABLP units or at the request of AB Holding, in its capacity as a limited partner of ABLP, pursuant to the request of AB Holding unitholders holding at least 50 of the issued and outstanding AB Holding units. AB Holding unitholders have the right to attend meetings of ABLP unitholders. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 
 In the event of the liquidation of either ABLP or AB Holding, the assets of the partnership remaining after the satisfaction of all debts and liabilities of the partnership will be distributed to unitholders pro rata in accordance with the positive balances in their capital accounts. Any remaining assets will be distributed to the unitholders in accordance with their percentage interests. 

Right to Compel Dissolution 
 
 Under each Partnership Agreement, the general partner may dissolve AB Holding or ABLP if the general partner receives the approval of the holders of a majority of ABLP units or AB Holding units, as applicable, excluding units owned by the general partner and its corporate affiliates. The general partner can compel dissolution by (1) means of a written determination that the projected future revenues of either AB Holding or ABLP over the next five years will not cover the partnership s projected costs and expenses in the same period, or (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the partnership. In most cases, the withdrawal, removal, bankruptcy or dissolution of the general partner will also compel dissolution.

DEMISED PREMISES 
 Floor (entire floor unless otherwise noted) 
 Delivery Date Concourse (part) (Sup15 23(a), Sup17 13, Sup23 2a) Delivered. Ground Floor (part) 
 The Ground Floor (part) formerly leased to Alliance has been surrendered and deleted from the demised premises. Landlord has leased the Ground Floor (part) to Wachovia Bank, National Association Wachovia pursuant to the Agreement of Lease dated December 22, 2003 (the Wachovia Lease ), for a term coterminous with Alliance's lease which Wachovia may extend pursuant to its three 5-year extension options. If the term of the Wachovia Lease expires or terminates prior to the expiration or termination of Alliance s lease, then, on the day after said termination, the Ground Floor (part) will be added back to the demised premises on substantially the same terms (including the rent terms) as were in effect prior to its surrender and deletion from the demised premises (Sup21 3). For more information regarding the terms of the surrender of Ground Floor part, see below. 2, 8, 9, 11 through 14 (Sup15 2(a) Ltr2 Sup16 11) Delivered. 10 (Sup19 3(a))

 Ground Floor (part) 
 For a summary of the payments Alliance makes in lieu of rent and the credits Alliance receives in respect of the Ground Floor (part), see Monthly Fixed Rent, Tax Escalation and Expense Escalation. Other terms of the surrender and deletion of Ground Floor (part) from the demised premises are summarized below. 
 Enforcement Landlord will make reasonable efforts to enforce the Wachovia Lease (including the rent obligations). If Wachovia defaults under the Wachovia Lease, then Alliance may, at its option, participate in any action Landlord takes in respect of said default. If Landlord does not take any action, then Alliance may, at its option, (1) cause the Landlord to assign its right to proceed against Wachovia, in which case Alliance may then proceed directly against Wachovia provided that Alliance indemnifies Landlord from any loss arising from such action, or (2) require the Landlord to proceed against Wachovia in which case Alliance will reimburse Landlord within 30 days after demand for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Landlord in respect of enforcing the Wachovia Lease (Sup21 4(f)). 
 Amendments, Terminations, Extensions and Consents Landlord is prohibited from amending the Wachovia Lease or waiving any provision thereof without first obtaining Alliance s consent. Alliance must be reasonable in respect of consenting to any amendment that would not have an economic or adverse impact on Alliance and Alliance s failure to respond to a request for such a consent within 5 business days of receipt is deemed consent. Landlord is prohibited from terminating the term of the Wachovia Lease except in the event of a default thereunder or extending the term of the Wachovia Lease except pursuant to the express provisions thereof without first obtaining Alliance's consent (Sup21 5(a)). Landlord is prohibited from granting its consent to any matter contemplated by the Wachovia Lease (e.g., subleases and alterations) without first obtaining Alliance s consent. Alliance's rights in respect of Wachovia signage is summarized in more detail below. Alliance is required to be reasonable in granting its consent to any such matter if Landlord is obligated to be reasonable under the Wachovia Lease. Alliance is required to respond in the same time period as Landlord is obligated to 
 5 

respond to any request for consent and Alliance will be deemed to have given its consent if it fails to respond (Sup21 5(c) LTR3 3). 
 Signage Wachovia is prohibited from displaying signage on the window, doors or the exterior of the perimeter walls of its demised premises unless Wachovia obtains the prior written reasonable consent of the Landlord and said signage is in conformity with the building standard sign program (Wachovia Lease 46.2(e)). However, Wachovia has the right to install signage on the interior and exterior of the demised premises that conforms with Wachovia's standard national or NYC signage program provided that said signage pertains primarily to general retail banking, safe deposits or electronic banking and not to certain permitted ancillary uses (e.g. brokerage, insurance, investment services). Nevertheless, Wachovia has the right to display temporary signage which describes said ancillary uses in certain designated areas provided that Wachovia is obligated to remove said signage if either Landlord or Alliance reasonably believes that said temporary signage is not in keeping with the quality or character of the building. The size and location of signage on or visible from the exterior of the Ground Floor (part) is subject to the reasonable approval and Landlord and Alliance. Wachovia also has the right to display promotional banners provided the size, color and location of said banners is subject to the reasonable approval of Landlord and Alliance. Landlord's (and, therefore, Alliance's) failure to respond within 15 business days to any request for consent regarding signage is deemed consent (Wachovia Lease 46.3(a)). 
 Assignment Subletting Profits Landlord and Alliance will share equally any sublease or assignment of lease profits payable to Landlord under the Wachovia Lease (Sup21 6(a)). 
 Hold Over by Wachovia If Wachovia holds over following the termination of the Wachovia Lease term, then Landlord will promptly commence summary dispossess proceedings and will use commercially reasonable efforts to evict Wachovia. Landlord will pay to Alliance any amounts recovered from Wachovia arising from said proceedings after first deducting Landlord's actual out-of-pocket expenses, provided that if the amounts paid over by Landlord exceed the sums paid by Alliance in respect of the Ground Floor (part) for the corresponding period, then Landlord will be permitted to retain 50 of said excess (Sup21 8). 
 Reimbursement of Landlord on Account of Payments to Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. Alliance will reimburse Landlord up to 601,854.52 in respect of any amounts paid by Landlord to Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. arising from Sup21 (Sup21 10).

 Each month, Landlord and Alliance apportion the fixed rent and tax escalation payments (if any) made by Wachovia that month and the portion to which Alliance is entitled is a credit against rent next payable. The apportionment is done as follows 
 First, to Alliance up to the sum of the fixed rent and tax and operating expense escalation payments Alliance made for such month in respect of the Ground Floor (part) 
 Second, to Alliance up to 10,408.26 a month provided that the aggregate of such installments cannot exceed 1,935,941.10)

Check Meters All floors have check meters except for Floors 31 (part), 32-34, and 37-39, which will have check meters on or before November 1, 2009 (Sup9 5) and Floor 42, which will have check meters on or before May 1, 2011 (Sup25 4(c)(i)). The check meters measure electricity demand and consumption for each floor during a calendar month. Alliance pays Landlord, within 30 days after receipt of a bill, Landlord s cost of the electricity consumed based on the applicable rate charged to the Landlord by the supplying utility, plus a 2 administrative fee (Sup9 5(b) and (c) Sup12 4(b) and (c) Sup14 4(b) and (c) Sup15 4(b) and (c) Sup22 4(b) Sup24 4(b) Sup25 4(c) Sup26 4(b)). Landlord will provide check meters for any portion of the Concourse (part) space measuring at least 3,000 contiguous rsf (Sup15 23(f)(i)). If the check meters for Floors 31 (part), 32-34, and 37-39 are not installed by November 1, 2009, then Alliance will pay Landlord what Landlord s electrical consultant determines to be Landlord s cost for such electricity, provided that Alliance may dispute such determination in accordance with a specified procedure. Dispute Each bill is binding on Alliance unless Alliance disputes such bill within 90 days of receipt. In case of a dispute, Alliance s electrical consultant will submit its determination within such 90 day period and Landlord and Alliance will seek a resolution. Upon Alliance s request, Landlord will make available its utility bills for the building for at least the last 3 years. If Landlord and Alliance cannot agree, they will choose a third electrical consultant to perform a limited review (Sup12, 5(c)(ii) Sup12 4(c)(ii) Sup14 4(c)(ii) Sup15 4(c)(ii) Sup22 4(c)(ii) Sup24 4(c)(ii) Sup25 4(c)(iii) Sup26 4(b)). Wattage 6 watts per usable square foot excluding building HVAC systems and other base building systems (Sup9 5(e) Sup12 4(e) Sup14 4(e) Sup15 4(e) Sup22 4(e) Sup24 4(e) Sup25 4(e) Sup26 4(e)). Additional Capacity Upon notice from Alliance, Landlord will provide Alliance with (1) an additional 400 amperes in the aggregate for the 15 th and 16 th floors (Sup12 4(e)), and (2) up to another 1,800 amperes for the entire demised premises (Sup14 4(f)). Such notice will be given by Alliance on or before, with regard to the 15 th and 16 th floors, the date Alliance delivers to Landlord its plans for its initial fit-out of the 15 th floor (but in no event later than June 30, 2001), and, with regard to the rest of the demised premises, by December 31, 2001 (Sup12 4(e) and Sup14 4(e)). Alliance is responsible for any construction costs it would incur in connection with alterations relating to such additional electricity supply, as well as a pro-rata share of Landlord s construction costs (Sup12 4(e) Sup14 4(e) and Sup15 4(f)). 
 Discontinuance of Service Landlord may discontinue furnishing electricity to Alliance only if Landlord simultaneously discontinues service to 80 of the other building tenants (Sup15 4(d)), upon 60 days written notice, provided such period is extended as reasonably necessary to permit Alliance to obtain electricity from the utility company servicing the Building. In such case, Alliance may use the existing wiring. The cost of installation of any additional wiring will be borne, if such discontinuance is voluntary, by Landlord, and if such discontinuance is involuntary, by Landlord and Alliance with Alliance s share equal to the total cost of such additional wiring multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is remaining months of the Lease term and the denominator of which is as follows

 Electricity Rent Inclusion Factor for Floors 31 (part), 32-34, and 37-39 
 Until November 1, 2009, the charge for electricity for Floors 31 (part), 32-34, and 37-39 (the ERIF is included in fixed annual rent (orig. 7.02(a)). Such charge, however, is separately quantified (as listed below) and is subject to increase or decrease (but in no event below 2.75 per s.f. per annum) in proportion to increases or decreases in Landlord s electricity costs for the building (orig. 7.02(a)). 

Floor (entire floor unless otherwise noted)

A determination by Landlord of a change in the ERIF as a result of a survey of electrical consumption in the Demised Premises will be binding on Alliance unless Alliance disputes such determination within 15 days of receipt of such determination. If Alliance disputes such determination, it will have its own electrical consultant at its own cost, attempt to resolve the dispute in consultation with Landlord s electrical consultant. If they cannot agree on a resolution, they will choose a third electrical consultant who s decision will control (orig. 7.03(b)). 
 
 Electricity Rent Inclusion Factor for 42 nd Floor 
 Until May 1, 2011, the charge for electricity for Floor 42 is included in fixed annual rent. The initial amount of such charge is 5.81 per s.f. and is subject to increase or decrease (but in no event below 5.81 per s.f. per annum) in proportion to increases or decreases in Landlord s electricity costs for the building as well based on Alliance s electricity consumption. A determination by Landlord of a change in the rent inclusion charge as a result of a survey of electrical consumption in the Demised Premises will be binding on Alliance unless Alliance disputes such determination within 30 days of receipt of such determination. If Alliance disputes such determination, it will have its own electrical consultant at its own cost attempt to resolve the dispute in consultation with Landlord s electrical consultant. If they cannot agree on a resolution, they will choose a third electrical consultant who s decision will control (Sup25 4(b)). 
 
 Supplies At Landlord s option, Alliance is required to purchase (for a reasonable charge) from Landlord all lighting tubes, lamps, bulbs and ballasts used in the demised premises (orig. 7.05(b)). Concourse Space Subject to the following sentence, for any portion of the demised premises located on the concourse consisting of less than 3,000 contiguous rsf, Alliance will pay an ERIF of 0.75 rsf, subject to increase if Alliance uses the space for anything other than storage (Sup15 23(f)(ii)). For the portion of the demised premises located on the concourse and leased pursuant to Sup23, however, Landlord will provide electricity at no additional charge provided that if Landlord determines on a reasonable basis that Alliance is consuming excessive electricity, then Landlord may commence charging Alliance for such electricity on either (at Landlord s option) a rent inclusion or submeter basis.

CLEANING 
 Cleaning services are provided by the Cleaning Contractor pursuant to two separate agreements, one covering the office space and the other covering the ground floor space. The following summary is applicable to both such agreements. Unless otherwise noted, the section references are also applicable to both agreements. 
 Services The Cleaning Contractor provides certain cleaning services for the office areas and lavatories of the demised premises 1(a)). The cleaning services provided do not include the cleaning of below-grade space, kitchen, pantry or dining space, storage, shipping, computer or word-processing space, or private or executive lavatories 1(b)). The Cleaning Contractor is not responsible for removing debris and rubbish from areas under construction in the demised premises 2). The quality of the cleaning services will be comparable to that provided in first class buildings in midtown Manhattan 1(a)). Access The Cleaning Contractor has access to the demised premises from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on business days. The Cleaning Contractor has the right to use Alliance s light, power and water, as reasonably required 1(a)). Term The cleaning agreements are co-terminous with the Lease 2). Fee Alliance pays the Cleaning Contractor, for the office space, a fixed monthly fee of 310,465.73, plus an amount equal to the fee for Floor 36 multiplied by the percentage increase in the labor rate in 2000 over 1999, plus an amount equal to the fee for Floors 2, 8, 9, 11-14 multiplied by the percentage increase in the labor rate in 2001 over 2000, plus an amount equal to the fee for Floor 10 multiplied by the percentage increase in the labor rate in 2001 over 2000 (CAO 3 CAO-2 3 CAO-3 3 CAO-4 3 CAO-5 3 CAO-6 3 CAO-7 3 CAO-8 3 CAO-9 3 CAO-11 3). Alliance pays the Cleaning Contractor a fixed monthly fee of 2,833.33 for the ground floor space (CAG 3). The fixed monthly fee for cleaning the office space will increase by 11,087.73 plus an adjustment based on the increase in the labor rate in 2008 over 2007 with the addition of remainder of Floor 31 to demised premises (CAO-10 3) and will increase by 36,604.68 plus an adjustment based on the increase in the labor rate in 2008 over 2007 with the addition of Floor 10 to demised premises (CAO-12 3). The monthly fee with respect to Floor 8 for the extended term of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024 is 14,717.83. (Sup28 2). The fixed monthly fee is inclusive of sales tax and is payable in advance on the first of each month 3). Payment for any additional cleaning services will be made by Alliance within 20 days of demand. The cost of such additional services must be comparable to services provided in comparable buildings 1(a)). In addition to the fixed fee, Alliance pays the Cleaning Contractor a percentage of annual increases in cleaning costs (which annual increases are equal to the annual percentage increase in porters wages over a porter s wage base year) over an amount representing base year cleaning costs. The percentage for the office space is 53.899 (CAO 3 and 4 CAO-2 3 CAO-3 3 CAO-4 3 CAO-5 3 CAO-6 3 CAO-7 3 CAO-8 3 CAO-9 3 CAO-11 3) and 0.483 for the ground floor space (CAG 4). The percentage for the office space will increase by 1.46 (CAO-10 3) to with the addition of the remainder of Floor 31 and will increase by 4.82 with the addition of Floors 43 and 44. The percentage for Floor 8 for the extended term of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024 is 2.29 . (Sup28 2). The other variables in such calculation are as follows

Dispute with Cleaning Contractor If Alliance believes that the Cleaning Contractor is not adequately performing under a cleaning agreement, and the Cleaning Contractor has not corrected such inadequate performance within 10 days after notice, Alliance may arbitrate whether the Cleaning Contractor is adequately performing. If a majority of the required arbitrators find that the Cleaning Contractor is not adequately performing, then the Cleaning Contractor will correct such inadequate performance within 10 days of such finding. If Contractor fails to do so, Alliance may terminate the cleaning agreement upon 10 days notice. 5). Default by Alliance If Alliance fails to make a payment due under a cleaning agreement within 15 days of notice of such failure, the Cleaning Contractor may, upon 10 days notice terminate the cleaning agreement if Alliance also fails to make such payment within such 10 day period. In case of such termination, Alliance may only use the approved cleaning contractor for the building 6).

ALTERATIONS 
 
 24 

Approval All alterations require Landlord s prior written approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that it does not (1) affect the structural integrity of the building, (2) affect the exterior of the building, or (3) adversely affect the building s systems without, in Landlord s opinion, adequate mitigation (orig. 8.01). Landlord s Reimbursement Alliance will reimburse Landlord s out-of-pocket costs incurred in reviewing alterations (orig. 8.01). Contractors Landlord s affiliate will act as general contractor for any alteration work performed anywhere in the demised premises for one year after the delivery of the 2 nd and 8 th -14 th floors, for a fee not to exceed 6 of the aggregate cost of such work. In acting as general contractor, Landlord s affiliate will obtain competitive bids from at least 3 subcontractors approved by Landlord for each category of work, except that there is only one approved subcontractor for air conditioning balancing work (although Alliance may have another subcontractor verify the work) and there are only 2 unaffiliated subcontractors for the base building work (Sup15 6(a)). Alliance and Plaza Construction Corp., Landlord' s affiliate, have subsequently entered into that certain Master Agreement dated January 27, 2004 pursuant to which Plaza Construction Corp. will provide construction management services to Alliance in respect of construction projects at the building. Landlord must have given its approval of any contractors performing alterations. Alliance will inform the Landlord of the name of any contractors or subcontractors Alliance proposes to do any alterations at least 10 days prior to work commencement (orig. 8.01 2(a)).

 Expiration of Term All improvements installed by Landlord are the property of the Landlord (orig. 8.03) and all permanent improvements (including, therefore, any kitchen, pantry or dining room) will remain at the expiration of the term without Alliance being obligated to remove such permanent improvements. (orig. 8.04) All fixtures (other than trade fixtures) installed by Landlord become the property of the Landlord, and will remain as part of the demised premises, upon expiration of the lease. All furnishings and trade fixtures supplied by Alliance at its expense are Alliance s property and, with regard to Alliance s furniture and movable office equipment only (Sup7 6(e)), will be removed upon the expiration of the lease term following the lease expiration unless Landlord notifies Alliance (within 30 days after Alliance s notice, which notice will be given at least 3 months prior to expiration of the lease term) that such property may remain in the demised premise following the lease term expiration (orig. 8.05).

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS RELATING TO IMPROVEMENTS 
 Emergency Generator Alliance is permitted to install a 2800 KW Detroit diesel emergency generator back-up power system in specified locations in the building (Sup27 2(b)). Alliance is permitted to connect the back-up power system to the building s emergency generator system. Up to 1500 KW of the power generated by the back-up power system will back-up the building s emergency generator system (Sup27 2(d)). Landlord will operate and maintain the back-up power system at Alliance s expense and, as part of such obligation, Landlord will enter into a maintenance contract for same subject to the reasonable approval of Alliance (Sup27 2(d)). Alliance is obligated to pay a one-time fee for such emergency generator rights equal to 75,000, adjusted for inflation based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (Sup27 2(f)). Alliance will pay for its proportionate share (based on KW capacity) of fuel purchased for the emergency generator system and has the right, subject to Landlord s reasonable approval, to install its own fuel storage tanks (Sup27 2(g)). The back-up power system will remain and not be removed at the end of the lease term (Sup27 2(i)). Alliance has, through 1 31 10, a limited right of first offer to lease space to install another emergency generator. Alliance has 15 days to accept any such offer (Sup27 3). Communications Antenna or Dish Alliance has the right, subject to the other alteration provisions of the Lease and to all applicable legal requirements, to install a communications antenna or dish on the roof in a location reasonably determined by Landlord. Landlord may require Alliance to relocate the antenna, at Landlord s expense, to mitigate interference with other uses, so long as the antenna is able to function in its relocated position, provided that if such relocation does mitigate the interference, Landlord may require Alliance to remove the antenna so long as no other antennas are allowed to be installed on the roof and Landlord bears the cost of such removal and the unamortized value of the antenna. If deemed reasonably advisable by Landlord s engineer, Landlord will, at Alliance s expense, reinforce the area under the antenna and, upon lease expiration, Alliance will remove the antenna and restore any damage caused thereby. Alliance will pay Landlord one-half of fair market rent for the roof space used by the antenna. Alliance, under Landlord s supervision (the cost of which Alliance is obligated to reimburse, has access to the roof and other areas of the building as reasonably necessary to maintain and repair the antenna (Sup9 20). Communications Wiring Landlord will provide Alliance a reasonable area in a common vertical riser shaft in the building for the installation of data, communications and security system cabling. Initial Fit-Out of Balance of 31st Floor Alliance, at its expense, will prepare a complete set of plans for the work, which is subject to the reasonable approval of Landlord (orig. 45.01). Although Alliance is permitted to use its own engineer, such plans ultimately are subject to the reasonable approval of Landlord s designated engineer. There is no deadline for the delivery to Landlord of the plans for Alliance s initial fit-out (Sup24 6(a)). Landlord will provide Alliance with a 762,240 allowance for the hard costs and certain soft costs of the fit-out. The allowance can be disbursed in installments upon Alliance s request and any unused portion will be credited against fixed rent (Sup24 6(b)(i)). Alliance may use the allowance to pay for construction work undertaken in the demised premises leased prior to Sup24, but if Alliance draws on the allowance prior to May 1, 2010 then the allowance will be reduced by the future value of the amount drawn upon calculated at 6 per year (Sup24 6(b)(ii)).

Landlord will provide Alliance with a 1,266,090 allowance for the hard costs and certain soft costs of the fit-out. The allowance can be disbursed in installments upon Alliance s request and any unused portion will be credited against fixed rent (Sup25 6(b)).

TERM 
 Expiration Date December 31, 2024. Landlord has exercised its right to extend the term from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2024. (Sup15 12(a), Sup15 13(a)(i)). Fixed annual rent during the extension period will be at the rate of the average fixed annual rent per s.f. being paid by Alliance on 12 30 19 for all of its space in building (other than ground floor, concourse or subconcourse space). The method of calculating escalations would remain unchanged for such period (Sup15 13(a)(ii) and (iii) Sup21 9(a)). Alliance s 10 Year Extension Option Alliance has the option to extend the term for 10 years (Sup9 12(a)) to expire on 12 31 34. 
 The exercise deadline for Alliance s 10 year extension option is 12 31 21 (Sup9 12(a)(i)). 
 As conditions to the exercise of Alliance s 10 year extension option, as of the date of exercise and as of the first day of the extension period (i) Alliance can not be in default of beyond applicable notice and grace periods of its obligation to pay fixed annual rent, tax escalations and expense escalations, and (ii) Alliance and its affiliates must occupy at least 200,000 rsf (Sup9 12(a)(ii) and (iii)). 
 The fixed annual rent for Alliance s 10 year extension period is 95 of fair market rent determined as of 36 months before what would have been the expiration of the term if the term had not been extended by Alliance s ten year extension option, as determined by Landlord and notified to Alliance in writing within 30 days thereafter, plus an increase in proportion to the increase over such 36 month period of the average of the CPI for Urban Consumers and CPI for Urban Wage Earners (both New York, NY-Northeast NJ, base year 1982-84 100, All Items (Sup9 12(b)). If Alliance disputes Landlord s determination of the rent, then Landlord and Alliance will resolve the dispute according to a specified arbitration process (Sup9 12(b) and 16). 
 For purposes of calculating real estate tax escalations, the base year during such extension period is 2019 20 if Landlord does not exercise its 5 year extension option, or 2024 25 if Landlord does exercise its 5 year extension option (Sup9 12(c)(i) Sup15 13(b) and (c)). For purposes of calculating expense escalations, the base year for building expenses during such extension period is calendar year 2019 if Landlord does not exercise its 5 year extension option, or calendar year 2024 if Landlord does exercise its 5 year extension option. (Sup9 12(c)(ii) and (iii) Sup15 13(b) and (c)).

SERVICES 
 Electricity See page 14. 
 Elevator Passenger Service will be provided as necessary on business days between 8 am and 6 pm and sufficient service at all other times (orig. 32.01). In case of special events at the demised premises, upon 24 hours notice from Alliance, Landlord will provide 2 dedicated elevators staffed by Landlord personnel, the labor cost of which will be reimbursable by Alliance within 30 days of demand (Sup9 24(a)). Landlord is required to have, in 1996, reconfigured the elevators so that the 32 nd floor and the 37 th , 38 th and 39 th floors are served by the same elevators (Sup6, 4(c)). 
 Freight Landlord will provide reasonable freight elevator service on business days from 8 am to 6 pm and after-hours service at landlord s established rates (orig. 32.01). During tenant s initial fit-out of the remainder of the 31 st floor, and the 42 nd , 43 rd and 44 th floors, Alliance has priority but not exclusive use of one freight elevator and non-priority use of a second freight elevator at no charge (Sup14 13(a) Sup15 16(a) Sup24 10(a) Sup25 10 Sup26 10). Subject to the terms of the alterations provisions and so long as Alliance is leasing floors 31 (part) through 41, Alliance has the right, at its expense, to make alterations so that any elevator servicing Floors 31 (part) through 41 can stop on any other floor leased by Alliance (Sup15 24). 
 HVAC Regular Service During regular hours of operation on business days as from time to time determined by Landlord, but always at least from 8 am to 6 pm, but excluding 9pm to 8 am (orig. 32.02(a)). 
 After-Hours Service Available upon reasonable notice at Landlord s established rates, payable upon presentation of bill, provided that 
 if any other tenants in the same air conditioning zone obtain after-hours service, the charge therefore will be equitably pro-rated (orig. 32.02(d)), and 
 Landlord will provide HVAC to Alliance free of charge on any non-business day that the New York Stock Exchange is open (Sup9 24(b)). 
 Supplemental AC Subject to the lease provisions (including the alterations section) and all applicable laws, Alliance may at its expense install self-contained package air-conditioning units in the demised premises. Alliance is responsible for the maintenance and repair of such units. Alliance may connect such units to any existing supplementary air-conditioning systems located in the demised premises as of the date the lease commenced with respect to the 37 th and 38 th floors (orig. 32.10). Alliance has the right to install at its own expense additional supplemental air conditioning in the demised premises subject to service being available from Landlord at Landlord s established per ton per annum connected load and line charge (Sup5 11(d)). Alliance has the right to install a supplemental air conditioning system on the 31 (part)-34 th , and 37 th -39 th floors and Landlord will provide condenser water therefor at a connected load and line charge fee of 500 per ton per annum increased after 1991 in proportion to the lease s expense escalations (Sup6 17 Sup7 19). 
 Condenser Water 
 Floors 2, 8-14 Alliance has reserved 190 tons of condenser water for use on the 2 nd and 8 th -14 th floors, with an option to reserve up to an additional 80 tons upon written notice to Landlord on or before 8 30 04. Landlord s charge for such condenser water is 568.35 plus annual increases based on the percentage increases in building and parking expenses. Alliance begins paying for such condenser water upon use (but no later after 1 year after delivery of the 2 nd and 8 th through 14 th floors). If Alliance requires more than 270 tons of condenser water for such space, then Landlord will use best efforts to obtain additional condenser from the building s existing supply and, if unsuccessful, will enter into good faith discussions regarding the installation of an additional cooling tower and allocation of costs relating thereto (Sup15 16(b)). 
 Floors 15-16 The 15 th floor has an existing supply of 12 tons of condenser water and the 16 th floor has an existing supply of 11 tons of condenser water. Alliance has the right to install at its own expense, pursuant to the alterations provisions of the Lease, a supplemental air-conditioning system on the 15 th and 16 th floors. Alliance was to have reserved its requirements of condenser water for such supplemental system from the existing supply on or before May 1, 1999 and of additional condenser water (up to 100 tons) by June 30, 2001 (Sup14 13(b)(ii)). We have been advised by Judd S. Meltzer Co. Inc., however, that Landlord has agreed to reduce such available tonnage to 60 tons in exchange for increasing the available tonnage to 100 tons with respect to Floors 35-36. Landlord s charge for such condenser water is 552 ton per annum plus annual increases over a 1997 base year (Sup12 14). 
 Floors 2, 8-14, 17 (part) Alliance was required to notify the Landlord of the amount of additional condenser water required by Alliance for its premises on Floors 2, 8-14 and 17 (part), which amount cannot exceed 20 tons, by August 31, 2002. Alliance begins paying for such condenser water upon use at a rate equal to 594.90 per ton per annum increased annually from 2001 at the same percentage rate that building operating expenses increase (Sup16 10(b)). 
 Floors 31 (part) - 34, 40, 41 We have been advised by Judd S. Meltzer Co. Inc. that Alliance has exercised its right to have Landlord supply Alliance with 250 tons condenser water for use in supplemental air conditioning units on Floors 31 (part)-34 or 40, 41 at a cost 250 ton yr for the first 250 tons yr and 500 ton yr (plus annual increases over the 1994 expenses base year). Any condenser water already being provided for Floors 31(part)-34 and 40, 41 are included in determining such rates. Alliance pays for the condenser water that Landlord has agreed to commit to Alliance, regardless of whether Alliance actually uses it (Sup9 24(f)). 
 Floors 35-36 Alliance may purchase up to 60 tons (in the aggregate) of condenser water for use in connection with its supplemental air-conditioning on the 35 th and 36 th floors. We have been advised, however, by Judd S. Meltzer Co. Inc. that Landlord has agreed to increase such available tonnage to 100 tons in exchange for reducing the available tonnage of additional condenser water to 60 tons with respect to Floors 15-16. Alliance must reserve the condenser water it wishes to purchase by February 8, 2001 (in respect of the 35 th floor) and December 31, 2001 (in respect of the 36 th floor) Landlord s charge for such condenser water is 568.35 ton per annum plus annual increases over a 1999 base year (Sup14 13(b)).

 So long as Alliance and its affiliates are in occupancy of at least 200,000 rsf, Alliance may fly a flag bearing its name and logo, the design of which is subject to landlord s reasonable approval, from a flagpole on the building plaza. No other flagpole may be installed on the building plaza without Alliance s approval (Sup9 10(d)). 
 Landlord is prohibited from installing any signage in the area of the lobby s upper elevator bank for an Alliance competitor occupying Floors 46-50, or a majority thereof (Sup13 19(d)).

CASUALTY CONDEMNATION 
 Casualty In case of casualty, Landlord is required to restore the building and or the demised premises (other than property installed by or on behalf of Alliance). Fixed annual rent and additional rent is abated to the extent that the demised premises or a portion thereof are unrentable and are not occupied by Alliance for the conduct of its business. In case of substantial casualty affecting the demised premises, Alliance may terminate the lease if Landlord s restoration is not completed within 1 year, subject to extension of up to an additional 6 months for circumstances beyond Landlord s reasonable control. (orig. 13.01). In case the building or the demised premises are substantially damaged in the last 2 years of the term, either Landlord or Alliance may cancel the lease upon notice given within 60 days of such casualty (orig. 13.02). Landlord may terminate the lease upon 30 days notice given within 120 days of a casualty that so damages the building that Landlord decides to demolish it or not rebuild it (orig. 13.03). Condemnation In case of a total condemnation of the demised premises, the lease terminates (orig. 14.01). In case of a condemnation other than a total condemnation of the demised premises, the lease will continue, but fixed annual rent and additional rent, will be abated proportionately, provided that if more than 25 of the demised premises is condemned, Alliance may terminate the lease upon 30 days notice given within 30 days after such condemnation (orig. 14.02). Landlord is required to repair any damage caused by such condemnation (orig. 14.02). In case of a condemnation of more than 25 of the demised premises, Landlord will, to the extent of the condemnation award, repair damage caused by such condemnation within 6 months of the condemnation, as such period may be extended due to force majeure. If Landlord fails to complete repairs within 6 months, as extended due to force majeure, Alliance may terminate upon 30 days notice (orig. 14.04). In case of any partial condemnation within the last 2 years of the term, either party may terminate the lease within 32 days of the condemnation upon 30 days notice (orig. 14.04).

Landlord has no recapture rights. Alliance may, without Landlord s consent, assign or sublet to a corporation into or with which Alliance is merged, with an entity to which substantially all of Alliance s assets are transferred, or to an entity which controls or is controlled by Alliance or is under common control with Alliance, subject to a net worth test 15.02). Also, Alliance may, without Landlord s consent, permit an affiliate (defined as an entity which controls or is controlled by Alliance or is under common control with Alliance to occupy all or a portion of the premises (orig. 15.08). Any permitted assignment or sublease will not be effective until Alliance delivers to Landlord a recordable sublease or assignment agreement reasonably satisfactory to Landlord pursuant to which the subtenant or assignee assumes all of Alliance s obligations under the Lease. Alliance will remain fully liable under the lease for the payment of rent and the performance of all of Alliance s other obligations under the Lease notwithstanding any such assignment or sublease (orig. 15.03). Landlord s Consent to assignment or sub-subletting by an assignee or subtenant Landlord s consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such further assignment or sub-sublease is subject to all of the other terms and conditions of the Lease regarding assignment and subletting (Sup7 12(b)). Profits If Alliance assigns the lease or sublets any portion of the demised premises other than to a corporation into which Alliance is merged or consolidated, or to which Alliance s assets are transferred or to any entity which controls or is controlled by Alliance or is under common control with Alliance, then Alliance will pay Landlord 50 of any profits after first deducting reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such assignment sublease amortized on a straight line basis over the balance of the lease term (in case of an assignment) or over the term of the sublease (in case of a sublease) (orig. 15.07). For the first 50 of rsf of demised premises other than ground floor space (including Floors 2 and 8-14 after such floors are delivered to Alliance (Sup15 19(a)) assigned or sublet by Alliance, Alliance will have the right to deduct as such a reasonable expense a Tenant Improvement Deduction , determined as of the commencement date of such sublease or assignment, and calculated as follows 
 ((A 2 B) C) x D, where 
 A amortized value of Alliance leasehold improvements (regardless of whether paid for with tenant allowance) based upon the average value of Alliance s unamortized leasehold improvements on a per rentable square foot basis for all of the demised premises other than any concourse space (Sup15 19(b) or ground floor space (Sup20 2(a)), amortized on a straight line basis from completion date until 10 31 09 (if located on Floors 37-39 and completed prior to 8 16 94 and such calculation is being made prior to the delivery of Floors 2 and 8-14 (Sup15 19(a))) or the lease expiration date (in all other cases) 
 B total landlord cash contribution or allowance to Alliance for leasehold improvements under the lease, 
 C total rsf of the demised premises, and 
 D rsf of the space being sublet or assigned. (Sup9 13(d)) 
 In determining profits, Alliance is permitted to take into account its electricity expenses under the lease and cleaning expenses (whether under separate agreement with Landlord s contractor or pursuant to the lease) (Sup9 13(d)), and its rental cost for the space being sublet or assigned will be determined using an average, on a rentable square foot basis, of its rental cost for the entire demised premises other than any concourse space or ground floor space (Sup20 2(b)) except with respect to any sublease or assignment of the 2 nd , 8 th -14 th or 17 th (part) floors made before Alliance ever occupies such space (which is the case for Floor 10 (Sup19 6(b)) in which case Alliance s rental cost will be based on its actual rental without including any deduction for unamortized tenant improvements (Sup15 19(d) Sup16 12, Sup17 11 Sup18 11). If Alliance subleases any part of Floors 2 and 8-14 or assigns the Lease with respect thereto after first occupying such space, then Alliance will have the right to take a Tenant Improvement Deduction as provided above.

 Provided no Event of Default exists and Tenant makes such election no later than eight months prior to the expiration of the then current Term, Tenant may elect to continue to use and occupy the Premises for up to four consecutive months upon the expiration of the then current Term (the Permitted Holdover Period at the Base Rent in effect during the last month of the then expired Term and upon all other terms and conditions of the Lease (including the payment of Additional Rent). If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration or termination of the Lease and any Permitted Holdover Period, Tenant is deemed to be a tenant at will at a Base Rent equal to 150 of the Base Rent in effect during the last month of the then expired or terminated Term and upon all other terms and conditions of the Lease (including the payment of Additional Rent) provided Landlord may terminate such tenancy-at-will on 30 days notice and Tenant may terminate such tenancy-at-will on 5 days notice.

 At the end of the Term, Tenant must leave the Premises broom-clean and in good repair and condition, with reasonable wear and tear and damage from casualty excepted.

 16. Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes 
 Commencing with the first full calendar year after the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant pays Tenant s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes for each calendar year, any part or all of which occurs during the Term (each, an Adjustment Period ). Tenant s Pro Rata Share with respect to the Initial Premises is 59.6496 . The Rent Commencement Date is May 3, 2021. 
 (a) Controllable Operating Expenses Prior to the first Adjustment Period during which the Building is at least 85 leased and occupied (the Stabilized Adjustment Period ), the amount of Controllable Operating Expenses included in Tenant s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses is the lesser of (x) Tenant s Pro Rata Share of Controllable Operating Expenses, and (y) the Base Amount of 6.05 per RSF. After the Stabilized Adjustment Period, the aggregate amount of Controllable Operating Expenses included in Operating Expenses in any Adjustment Period will not increase by more than 4 over the aggregate amount of Controllable Operating Expenses included in Operating Expenses for the prior Adjustment Period. To the extent that Controllable Operating Expenses for the Stabilized Adjustment Period exceed the Base Amount (the amount of such excess, per RSF, being referred to as the Excess COE ), then, for the entire Term, Tenant will receive a credit against Tenant s Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses in an amount equal to the Excess COE multiplied by the RSF of the Premises. For example, if Controllable Operating Expenses for the Stabilized Adjustment Period equals 7 per RSF, then Tenant will receive an annual credit equal to 0.95 per RSF. 
 (b) Capital Expenditures Operating Expenses cannot include any capital expenditures, except capital expenditures required pursuant to any law which is first in effect after the Commencement Date or which reduce Operating Expenses, the costs of which capital expenditures (i) will be amortized over the useful life thereof with reasonable interest at the rate required by Landlord to finance the applicable capital expenditure, (ii) cannot exceed 7.5 of the amount of Operating Expenses for the applicable Adjustment Period, and (iii) cannot exceed the actual savings if the capital expenditure is to reduce Operating Expenses.

 32012088.v4

The day immediately following the last day of the Free Rent Period shall be referred to in this Lease as the Rent Commencement Date provided that, for purposes of Article 7 only, if an Event of Default occurs during the Free Rent Period, the Rent Commencement Date shall be deemed to be the date on which such Event of Default occurred (but the foregoing shall not vitiate Tenant s rights to any abatement of Rent thereunder as a result of the early occurrence of the Rent Commencement Date that Tenant is otherwise entitled upon a cure of such Event of Default pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 2.5) .

Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, to the extent that there is a simultaneous delay resulting from a Landlord Delay and an Unavoidable Delay i.e. , the specific period of delay is caused by both a Landlord Delay and an Unavoidable Delay), such that such specific period of delay would have occurred solely from an Unavoidable Delay even if Landlord Delay had not occurred, the number of days of such simultaneous delay shall be deemed to be an Unavoidable Delay. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant shall not be entitled to any of the credits against Fixed Rent and Recurring Additional Rent on account of a Landlord Delay if such Landlord Delay occurs on the same day or days (or is for the same underlying act or omission) as an occurrence under any other Section of this Lease, which causes a deferral or extension of the Rent Commencement Date (or provides Tenant with a rent abatement or credit) for the space affected by such Landlord Delay i.e. , not double counted).

The amount of the Accelerated Work Costs set forth in the Accelerated Work Costs Notice shall be subject to Landlord s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any disputes regarding the amount of the Accelerated Work Costs shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Article 36 . The parties acknowledge that if Landlord so approves the amount of the Accelerated Work Costs and pays the Accelerated Work Costs to Tenant as described above, then for purposes of the credits against Fixed Rent and Recurring Additional Rent described in Section 2.8(b)(i), Section 2.8(b)(iii) , Section 2.8(b)(vii) and or Section 2.8(b)(viii) above, Tenant shall be deemed to have completed its Initial Installations and commenced occupancy of the Premises for the ordinary conduct of business therein on the earlier of (x) the date which is 90 days after the date the Initial Installations are substantially completed or such earlier date that Tenant has in fact commenced occupancy of all or a part of the Premises for the ordinary conduct of business and (y) the Make-up Occupancy Date set forth in the Accelerated Work Costs Notice provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (y) , the Make-up Occupancy Date shall be postponed on a day-for-day basis until the date which is 90 days after the date the Initial Installations are substantially completed (or until such earlier date that Tenant has in fact commenced occupancy of all or a part of the Premises for the ordinary conduct of business) if and for so long as Tenant is performing the Initial Installations 
 17 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

with all due diligence on an accelerated or expedited work basis as set forth in the Accelerated Work Costs Notice. 
 (g) If, at the time a credit against Fixed Rent and Recurring Additional Rent under this Section 2.8 is to be applied, a monetary Event of Default then exists, Landlord may offset the amount of any non-disputed sums owing to Landlord on account thereof from any such credit. 
 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.8 , in no event shall any Actual Delay provided for herein extend beyond the earlier to occur of (i) the date that Tenant has in fact commenced occupancy of all or a part of the Premises for the ordinary conduct of business, or (ii) the date which is 90 days after the date Tenant is able to Substantially Complete the Initial Installations and legally occupy the Premises i.e. , a voluntary election by Tenant not to move into the Building when it is legally able to do so will not constitute an Actual Delay).

 Section 38.3 Measurement . 
 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 4.3 , Landlord and Tenant agree that the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building set forth in Article 1 shall be conclusive and binding on both parties regardless of any measurement of the Premises and or of the Building after the Effective Date. Attached hereto as Exhibit L is a current schedule of the rentable square feet and usable feet of all of the floors of the Building (including, without limitation, all of the floors constituting the Premises) (the RSF USF Schedule ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon Landlord s completion of the construction drawings for the Building, for informational and design purposes only, Landlord shall provide Tenant with an updated RSF USF Schedule in the case of any changes thereto (or confirming no changes). Prior to the Commencement Date, Landlord shall cause Landlord s architect to measure the floor area of the Premises and the Building using the REBNY Method and shall promptly deliver to Tenant such measurements Landlord s Determination and Landlord s architect s report (accompanied by reasonable supporting information) showing how the Landlord s Determination was made (the Landlord s Architect s Repor t ). If there is a change in the Agreed Area of the Premises or the Agreed Area of Building from the original RSF USF Schedule pursuant to this Section 4.3 , such change shall apply to Tenant s Proportionate Share and to the Fixed Rent and Landlord s Contribution and to any other provisions of this Lease affected by the size of the Premises and proportionate adjustments therefor shall be made to account for such change provided, however, that for purposes of this sentence, in no event shall the Agreed Area of Premises as finally established pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 for purposes of determining Tenant s Proportionate Share, Fixed Rent, Landlord s Contribution, and such other calculations as are affected by the size of the Premises, exceed 102 of the original RSF USF Schedule, pursuant to this Section 4.3 . The REBNY Method means determining the rentable square feet of an area by calculating the Usable Area in accordance with the Real Estate Board of New York Recommended Method of Floor Measurement for Office Buildings, effective January 1, 1987 and as subsequently amended in 2003 and computing the rentable area utilizing a loss factor from rentable to usable for a full office floor of 27 . 
 (b) Tenant shall have the right to elect to have Tenant s architect confirm the measurement of the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building in accordance with the REBNY Method by giving Landlord notice of such election within 90 days after the Commencement Date. Absent such notice that Tenant elects to have Tenant s architect 
 24 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

measure the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building, Landlord s Determination shall be conclusively binding on Landlord and Tenant. If Tenant elects to have Tenant s architect measure the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building Tenant s Determination ), Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of Tenant s architect s report (accompanied by reasonable supporting information) showing how the Tenant s Determination was made Tenant s Architect s Report within 60 days after delivery to Landlord of such election by Tenant to have Tenant s architect confirm the measurement of the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building. If Tenant fails to deliver a copy of Tenant s Architect s Report to Landlord within such 60 day period set forth above, Landlord s Determination shall be conclusively binding on Landlord and Tenant. 
 (c) If the Agreed Area of Premises or the Agreed Area of Building is not established pursuant to the terms of Section 4.3(a) or S ection 4.3(b) and Landlord and Tenant do not otherwise agree in writing upon the Agreed Area of Premises or the Agreed Area of Building (as applicable) within 15 days after Landlord s receipt of Tenant s Architect s Report, then the Alternative Re-measurement Procedure shall apply. The Alternative Re-measurement Procedure shall be as follows Landlord s architect and Tenant s architect shall jointly appoint an independent third party architect within 10 days after the aforementioned 15 day period (it being agreed that if Landlord s architect and Tenant s architect are unable to agree upon the identity of the third architect, Landlord and Tenant shall petition the President of the American Institute of Architects to select an appropriate independent third architect having an office in New York, New York). Within 20 days after his or her appointment, the third architect shall notify Landlord and Tenant that the third architect finds the overall determination of the Agreed Area of Premises or the Agreed Area of Building (as applicable) set forth in the Landlord s Architect s Report or in the Tenant s Architect s Report to be the more accurate. The Agreed Area of Premises or the Agreed Area of Building (as applicable) as set forth in the selected architect s report shall then be the Agreed Area of Premises and or the Agreed Area of Building (as applicable) for all purposes under this Lease. 
 (d) Until such time as the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building are established, the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building shall be based on the average of Landlord s Determination and Tenant s Determination (unless Landlord reasonably determines that Tenant s Determination was not determined in good faith, or Tenant has not provided Tenant s Determination, in which case same shall be based upon Landlord s Determination only). When the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building have been determined as set forth herein, (i) Exhibit L shall be updated to reflect the final determination of the Agreed Area of Building (including the Agreed Area of Premises) (ii) Rent theretofore paid by Tenant to Landlord shall be retroactively adjusted, and (A) any deficiency due to the retroactively adjusted square footage calculations shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within 30 days after the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building has been determined as set forth herein or (B) any excess Rent theretofore paid by Tenant due to the retroactively adjusted square footage calculations shall be credited towards the payments of Fixed Rent next coming due under this Lease until exhausted, and (iii) any Landlord s Contribution paid by Landlord shall be retroactively adjusted, and (A) any deficiency in the amount of the Landlord s Contribution due to the retroactively adjusted square footage calculations shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant or as otherwise directed by Tenant within 30 days after the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building have been determined as set forth herein or (B) any excess Landlord s Contribution previously paid to Tenant shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord within 30 days after the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building have been determined as set forth herein and (iv) Tenant s Proportionate Share and the Recurring Additional Rent shall be appropriately adjusted based upon the adjusted Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building. Within 30 days after such measurements are determined as aforesaid, the parties shall execute an amendment to this Lease, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant, setting forth the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building and confirming Tenant s Proportionate Share and such other appropriate modifications of the terms of this Lease as are affected by the size of the Premises but the failure of either party to sign such amendment shall not affect the 
 25 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

final determination of the Agreed Area of Premises, Agreed Area of Building or Tenant s Proportionate Share or the rights of the parties under this Lease. 
 (e) (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreed Area of the Premises as finally established pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 exceeds the Agreed Area of the Premises as specified in Article 1 hereof by more than 2 , then Tenant shall have the right, upon irrevocable notice (the RSF Contraction Notice delivered to Landlord within 30 days following the date the Agreed Area of Premises are finally established pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 , time being of the essence , to exclude from the Premises (at Landlord s sole cost and expense) a portion of the highest contiguous floor of the Premises such that the balance of such floor not leased by Tenant is in increments of one-quarter of the rentable square footage of such floor and in a marketable configuration for lease to a third party tenant as mutually and reasonably agreed to by Landlord and Tenant (the RSF Contraction Space ). In the event that Tenant fails to timely send the RSF Contraction Notice, Tenant shall no longer have any right to exclude the RSF Contraction Space from the Premises pursuant to this Section 4.3(e)(i) . In the event that Tenant timely delivers the RSF Contraction Notice, effective as of the date of such RSF Contraction Notice (the RSF Contraction Option Date ), this Lease in respect of the RSF Contraction Space shall come to an end and expire on the RSF Contraction Option Date with the same force and effect as if said date were the Expiration Date set forth in this Lease, and, as of the RSF Contraction Option Date, the RSF Contraction Space shall be excluded from the Premises in the same manner as the Pre-CD Contraction Space would be executed from the Initial Premises pursuant to Section 32.2 , appropriately modified, mutatis mutandis , as if the RSF Contraction Space were the Pre-CD Contraction Space. 
 (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Agreed Area of the Premises as finally established pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 is less than the Agreed Area of the Premises as specified in Article 1 hereof by more than 2 , then Tenant shall have the right, upon irrevocable notice (the RSF Expansion Notice delivered to Landlord within 30 days following the date the Agreed Area of Premises are finally established pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 time being of the essence ), to add to the Premises (at Landlord s sole cost and expense) either (A) if the highest floor of the Initial Premises is a partial floor, a portion of such floor contiguous to the Initial Premises such that the balance of such floor not leased by Tenant is in increments of one-quarter of the rentable square footage of such floor or (B) if the highest floor of the Premises is a full floor, a portion of a full floor contiguous thereto in increments of one-quarter of the rentable square footage of such floor, in either case, which particular demising location shall be mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant acting in good faith (as applicable, the RSF Expansion Space ), which RSF Expansion Space in any case shall be contiguous to the highest contiguous floor of the Premises, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4.3(e)(ii) . In the event Tenant shall fail to designate the RSF Expansion Space in the RSF Expansion Notice, and such failure continues for 3 Business Days after Landlord delivers notice thereof to Tenant, the RSF Expansion Space shall be deemed to be the lesser of (x) the balance, and (y) one-half, of the floor in the case of clause (A) above or one-half of the floor in the case of clause (B) above (as applicable). In the event that Tenant fails to timely send the RSF Expansion Notice, Tenant shall no longer have any right to expand the Premises pursuant to this Section 4.3(e)(ii) . Effective as of the date on which Landlord delivers vacant possession of the RSF Expansion Space to Tenant with Landlord s Premises Work Substantially Completed (the RSF Expansion Space Commencement Date ), Landlord shall be deemed to have delivered to Tenant, and Tenant shall be deemed to have accepted from Landlord, possession of the RSF Expansion Space in the same manner as the Pre-CD Expansion Space would be added to the Initial Premises pursuant to Section 31.3 , appropriately modified, mutatis mutandis , as if the RSF Expansion Space were the Pre-CD Expansion Space (provided that if the RSF Expansion Space is a full floor of the Building, the Bathroom Contribution shall be increased appropriately on account of the leasing of such RSF Expansion Space). For avoidance of doubt, the RSF Expansion Space shall, if applicable, be contiguous to any Pre-CD Expansion Space added to the Premises pursuant to Article 31 below. 
 26 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

(f) In no event shall the Agreed Area of Premises and the Agreed Area of Building include the area of any terraces adjoining the Premises.

 Section 38.4 LEED . Landlord agrees that certain building work will be Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED certifiable Silver (and may be certifiable Gold under the current LEED Green Building Rating System.

If such LEED certification is obtained, Tenant shall endeavor (without material cost to Tenant) to comply with all required guidelines and conditions of the Building LEED so as to not adversely affect such LEED status but failure to do so by Tenant shall not be a default by Tenant under this Lease and Tenant shall have no obligation to design the Initial Installations (or any other Alterations), or apply, for any LEED certification unless required by applicable Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any damages or otherwise as a result of any failure to obtain LEED certification and this Lease and the occurrence of the Commencement Date shall be unaffected thereby. 
 Section 38.5 Base Building Plans . Landlord represents to Tenant that Exhibit C-5 attached hereto sets forth a true, correct and complete list, in all material respects, of all Base Building Plans that exist as of the Effective Date and has made the same available to Tenant on or before the Effective Date. Landlord shall make available to Tenant as and when available updated Base Building Plans (deemed to be 100 construction drawings). Landlord agrees to hold meetings with Tenant on at least a quarterly basis regarding the design and development of Landlord s Work and the Base Building Plans therefor, at which meetings Landlord shall provide Tenant with updates as to any changes to the Base Building Plans which in Landlord s good faith judgment affect the Initial Installations and or Tenant s use or occupancy of the Premises beyond a de minimis extent.

 I. All capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agency Lease. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, terms, conditions, and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows 
 1. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Tenant Lease and any extensions, modifications or renewals thereof, including but not limited to any option to purchase, right of first refusal to purchase or right of first offer to purchase the Premises or any portion thereof, if any, is and shall continue to be subject and subordinate in all respects to the Security Instrument and the lien created thereby provided that, as between Landlord and Tenant, nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights or obligations of Landlord or Tenant under the Tenant Lease.. 
 2. Tenant agrees to deliver to Mortgagee, contemporaneously with sending the same to Landlord and in the manner set forth in Paragraph 13 of this Agreement, a copy of any notice of default sent to Landlord by Tenant that would entitle Tenant to cancel or terminate the Tenant Lease. If Landlord fails to cure such default within the time provided in the Tenant Lease, Mortgagee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure such default on behalf of Landlord within the time provided for Landlord to cure such default in the Tenant Lease (it being agreed that if the Tenant Lease does not have such a time period, it shall be deemed to be (i) 10 days in the case of a monetary default and (ii) 30 days in the case of a non-monetary default), plus (A) 10 days in the case of a monetary default and (B) 30 days in the case of a non-monetary default, or, if such non-monetary default cannot be cured within that time, within a reasonable period provided Mortgagee commenced to cure such default within such 30-day period and is proceeding with due diligence to cure such default to completion, but in no event shall such additional period exceed 180 days from the date on which Tenant shall have given Mortgagee the notice of default relating thereto. If any non-monetary default requires possession and control of the Property, then, provided Mortgagee undertakes by written notice to Tenant to exercise reasonable efforts to cure or cause to be cured by a receiver such non-monetary default within the period permitted by this Paragraph 2 , Mortgagee s cure period shall continue for such additional time as Mortgagee may reasonably require to either (I) obtain possession and control of the Property with reasonable diligence and thereafter cure the default with reasonable diligence and continuity or (II) obtain the appointment of a receiver and give such receiver a reasonable period of time in which to cure such non-monetary default, but in no event shall such additional period exceed 180 days from the date on which Tenant shall have given Mortgagee the notice of default relating thereto. In such event, Tenant shall not terminate the Tenant Lease while such curative action is being diligently pursued by Mortgagee. Further, Tenant shall not terminate the Tenant Lease on the basis of any default by Landlord which is incurable by Mortgagee (such as, for example, the bankruptcy of Landlord or breach of any representation by Landlord), provided Mortgagee is proceeding with due diligence to commence an action to appoint a receiver or to obtain possession of the Premises by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise (collectively, Foreclosure ). Tenant hereby agrees that no action taken by Mortgagee to enforce any rights under the Security Instrument or related security 
 14 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

documents, by reason of any default thereunder (including, without limitation, the appointment of a receiver, any Foreclosure or any demand for rent under any assignment of rents or leases) shall give rise to any right of Tenant to terminate the Tenant Lease nor shall such action invalidate or constitute a breach of any of the terms of the Tenant Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (1) nothing in this Agreement shall extend the dates in Section 2.7 of the Tenant Lease and Tenant shall be permitted to terminate the Tenant Lease pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 2.7 thereof without giving Mortgagee a right to cure (2) nothing in this Agreement shall extend any of the dates contained in Section 2.8 of the Tenant Lease and Tenant shall be entitled to credits against rent (if any) that Tenant is entitled to in respect thereof without giving Mortgagee a right to cure (3) nothing in this Agreement shall vitiate any of Tenant s rights in Section 2.6 of the Tenant Lease in the event of Landlord Delay and Tenant shall be entitled to the credits against rent (if any) that Tenant is entitled to in respect thereof without giving Mortgagee a right to cure (4) the additional cure periods in this Paragraph 2 shall not be applicable to any termination right that Tenant has under Article 11 of the Tenant Lease and (5) under no circumstances shall the Mortgagee be responsible for payment of the Termination Fee (as defined in the Tenant Lease), or any amounts payable under Section 2.6 or Section 2.8(f) of the Tenant Lease it being agreed, however, that Tenant shall have the right to offset any such amounts under Section 2.6 or Section 2.8(f) of the Tenant Lease that have not been applied in full on or prior the Takeover Date or which relate to any obligation which arises from or after the Takeover Date. 
 3. So long as Tenant is not in default beyond any notice and cure periods that would permit Landlord to terminate the Tenant Lease or exercise any remedy to dispossess the Premises from Tenant, and the Tenant Lease is otherwise in full force and effect, Mortgagee agrees as follows 
 i. Mortgagee shall not, in any Foreclosure (A) disturb, interfere with, or deprive Tenant (or, with respect to any person or entity claiming through or under Tenant, such person or entity) of its possession or its right to possession of the Premises (or any part thereof) under or by virtue of the Tenant Lease, or any right or privilege granted to or inuring to the benefit of Tenant (and any such person or entity claiming through or under Tenant) under or by virtue of the Tenant Lease (including, without limitation, all rights, privileges, easements, renewal or expansion options and licenses granted to or inuring to the benefit of Tenant (or any such person or entity) under or by virtue of the Tenant Lease) or (B) terminate Tenant s (or any such person or entity s) possession of the Premises under the Tenant Lease, except in accordance with the express terms of the Tenant Lease and this Agreement and 
 ii. Mortgagee shall not name or join Tenant (or, with respect to any person or entity claiming through or under Tenant, such person or entity) as a defendant in any exercise of Mortgagee s rights and remedies arising upon a default under the Security Instrument unless applicable law requires Tenant (or any such person or entity claiming through or under Tenant) to be made a party thereto as a condition to proceeding against Landlord or prosecuting such rights and remedies. In the latter case, Mortgagee may join Tenant (or any such person or entity claiming through or under Tenant) as a defendant in such action only for such purpose and not to terminate the Tenant Lease or otherwise diminish, interfere or otherwise adversely affect Tenant s rights under the Tenant Lease or this Agreement in such action. 
 4. If Mortgagee or its nominee or designee, or another purchaser of the Property (or any portion thereof that includes the Premises) upon a Foreclosure (any such person or entity, a Successor Owner succeeds to the interest of Landlord under the Tenant Lease, 
 15 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

subject to Tenant s performance of its obligations under the Tenant Lease, the Tenant Lease will continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between Successor Owner and Tenant, and Successor Owner shall be subject to the provisions of the Tenant Lease with the same force and effect as if the Tenant Lease were a direct lease between Successor Owner and Tenant. Thereupon, Successor Owner shall recognize the Tenant Lease and Tenant s rights thereunder and Tenant shall make full and complete attornment to Successor Owner as substitute landlord upon the same terms, covenants and conditions as provided in the Tenant Lease, including, but not limited to, any option to purchase, right of first refusal to purchase or right of first offer to purchase the Premises as may be provided in the Tenant Lease, with the same force and effect as if Successor Owner were Landlord under the Tenant Lease, such recognition and attornment to be effective as of the Takeover Date (as defined in Paragraph 5(b) ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant agrees that any such option, right of first refusal or right of first offer to purchase the Premises or any portion thereof, as may be provided in the Tenant Lease shall not apply to any Foreclosure, as defined herein, and shall not apply to any transfer of the Property (or any portion thereof that includes the Premises) by Mortgagee (if Successor Owner is Mortgagee) following such Foreclosure. In consideration of the foregoing, Mortgagee agrees that any such option, right of first refusal or right of first offer shall not be terminated by any Foreclosure or conveyance of the Property (or any portion thereof that includes the Premises) by Mortgagee (if Successor Owner is Mortgagee) following such Foreclosure rather, any such option, right of first refusal or right of first offer shall remain as an obligation of any party acquiring the Property (or any portion thereof that includes the Premises) following the conveyance of the Property (or any portion thereof that includes the Premises) by Successor Owner following such Foreclosure. Furthermore, Tenant expressly confirms to Mortgagee that any acquisition of title to all or any portion of the Premises pursuant to Tenant s exercise of any option, right of first refusal or right of first offer contained in the Tenant Lease shall result in Tenant taking title subject to the lien of the Security Instrument. Mortgagee and Tenant agree, each at its own expense, to execute and deliver, at any time and from time to time upon request of either party, any agreement reasonably satisfactory to such party that may reasonably be necessary or appropriate to evidence such attornment and recognition provided that such agreement does not diminish or increase any of either party s obligations or adversely affect any of either party s rights. 
 5. Tenant agrees that, if Successor Owner shall succeed to the interest of Landlord under the Tenant Lease, Successor Owner shall not be 
 (a) liable for any prior act or omission of Landlord or any prior landlord Former Landlord which occurs prior to the Takeover Date, except to the extent such act or omission continues after the date that Successor Owner succeeds to the interest of Landlord under Tenant Lease, or consequential damages arising therefrom or 
 (b) subject to any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have as to Former Landlord except (i) defenses which Tenant might have to claims that accrued and that relate solely to a period prior to the date on which Successor Owner succeeded to the interest of Former Landlord under the Tenant Lease (such date, the Takeover Date and then only to the extent the related prior claim is pursued by Successor Owner or (ii) any right to offset, abate or credit against rent (or any portion thereof) expressly set forth in Sections 2.5, 2.6 (as modified by Paragraph 2 above), 2.8 (including as modified by Paragraph 2 above as it relates to Section 2.8(f)), 4.2, 4.3(d), 7.2(a)(i), 7.2(b), 7.3(a), 7.3(b), 7.4(a)(i), 7.4(b), 7.5, 7.6(b), 8.1(e), 10.20, 11.3, 12.1(b), 12.1(e), 16.2, 16.3(c) or 29.2(b) of the Tenant Lease that has not been applied in full on or prior to the Takeover Date, it being agreed that Successor Owner shall recognize any such offsets, abatements or credits that have not been applied in full prior to the Takeover Date provided, however, except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5(d) below, Section 16.3(d) of the Tenant Lease shall not apply to Successor Owner or

 9. Nothing in this Agreement shall impose upon Mortgagee any liability for the obligations of Landlord under the Tenant Lease unless and until Mortgagee takes title to the Landlord s interest in the Property or the portion thereof containing the Premises. Anything herein or in the Tenant Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Successor Owner shall acquire title to the Landlord s interest in the Property or the portion thereof containing the Premises, Successor Owner shall have no obligation, nor incur any liability,

EXHIBIT N 
 
 ELEVATOR PERFORMANCE 

Landlord LL shall provide the following elevator performance based on the below Tenant TT population and usage assumptions. 
 
 Population and usage assumptions 
 
 Maximum actual population on TT s floors in place at any time (the Maximum Population 987 (for 138,135 USF over 4 floors total), as proportionately adjusted for any increases in USF based on remeasurement or Substitute Office Premises. 
 
 Car Loading 72 of car capacity 
 
 Morning Arrival peak loading is 11.5 of TT s Maximum Population over a 5 minute period with 90 of such Maximum Population up and 10 of such Maximum Population down or inter floor 
 
 Two-way peak traffic over a 2 hour period (with peak loading of 11.5 of TT s Maximum Population) 
 45 of such Maximum Population up 
 45 of such Maximum Population down 
 10 of such Maximum Population floor 
 
 Elevator Performance Standards 
 
 Morning up-peak average waiting time 25 seconds (averaged over peak 1 hour) 
 
 Two-way traffic (lunch time) average waiting time 30 seconds (averaged over peak 2 hours) 
 
 If, in the judgement of LL, improved service for the bank would result from splitting the bank so that the TT receives 4 dedicated passenger cars, LL will have the right to make this change at any time during the term of the lease. If LL is unable to deliver the above-noted elevator performance standards based on the Maximum Population and usage assumptions contained in this exhibit, then LL will have a 90 day window to take corrective action. If, after taking corrective active, the LL is unable to meet the Elevator Performance Standards, then TT will have the right to request and LL will have the obligation to effect, the separation (not physical) of the bank so that TT has 4 dedicated passenger cars. 
 
 Elevator Performance Standards will be measured as follows. On a non-holiday Wednesday, using either existing cameras or setting up task-specific cameras, recordings will be made of all calls entered and people flow to elevator cars. Each unique waiting time will be measured from the (i) starting point the later of when a person is positioned mid elevator lobby (in the case where the turnstile provides the call or after a person enters a call on the keypad within the elevator lobby. In the case of a person not entering a call (because others have done so and the group are going to the same floors), then that start point shall be measured from the time that the person is positioned mid elevator lobby to the (ii) end point when the respective elevator car doors open. 
 
 The average waiting time will then be calculated by dividing the sum of all individual waiting times over the performance period (60 minutes in the case of morning up-peak and 120 minutes in the case of midday two-way traffic) by the total minutes in that period (60 minutes in the case of morning up-peak and 120 minutes in the case of midday two-way traffic). 
 
 N-1 
 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

In the event that TT is allocated 4 dedicated passenger cars, and one of the 4 cars is rendered inoperable during normal business hours, then LL shall unpartition the dispatch system through programming, so that all of the remaining cars operate as a single group as soon as reasonably possible.

 Responsible Contractor Policy and Approved Contractors 
 General Find enclosed Exhibit 1 Tishman Speyer s Responsible Contractor Policy dated August 23, 2006. This policy is applicable to service and construction contractors retained by Tishman Speyer for work being performed at all of their properties within the United States. Paraphrasing the Statement of Purpose, in article 1, of the Responsible Contractors Policy Tishman Speyer, a prominent real estate company has had and will continue to have a strong relationship with labor and supports the philosophy of investors who believe in responsible contracting. A trained labor force that is appropriately compensated will provide high quality products and services which will directly contribute to the investment and operating success of a particular asset. The implementation of the Tishman Speyer Responsible Contractors Policy for both Property Management and Design and Construction is to be coupled with and incorporated into the approved contractor list for all base building and tenant work. 
 Procedure This Standard Operating Procedure will provide the guidelines of how the Property Management and the Design and Construction groups will implement the Responsible Contractors Policy 
 
 a. The approved contractors list is to be common for each city or region, as appropriate, and is to be developed following the guidelines listed herein. 
 b. It is recognized that the approved contractors list that Property Management requires to operate a building can be different from that of the Design and Construction group s major construction projects. This can be due to the size of the project, type of work, services or other unique requirements. Therefore, two distinct approved contractor s lists can be developed for a city or region. 
 c. Although there can be an approved contractors lists for Property Management and another for Design and Construction, within a particular city or region, it will be required that as much synergism as possible be obtained between the two lists. Having commonality of contractors will gain the attention of the contractors to 
 i. Immediately address any problems as they may arise. 
 ii. Provide quality workmanship and service to ownership and tenants. 
 iii. Ensure schedules are met. 
 iv. Expeditiously address any potential lien issues. 
 v. Obtain favorable pricing.

 1930820.10 29086-0006-000 

TENANT WELCOME MANUAL 66 Hudson Boulevard 

d. Both Property Management and the Design and Construction group shall work jointly on the development of the approved contractors list including agreeing on where synergism is not practical or possible. Each group shall participate in the development of each other s list and agree to the final listing of contractors on each other s list. 
 e. The Property Management lead shall be the Operation head of a region, working together with the Property Management team within that region. 
 f. Design and Construction lead shall be its regional Managing Director working together with the Design and Construction staff within that region. 
 g. In order to meet the intent of the approved contractors list as noted above and ensure fair competition, the list of contractors for a particular trade, service or consulting, etc., shall be limited in number. The number of vendors for a particular task will vary per task. The larger used contractors such as Electrical, HVAC and Plumber s should be limited to approximately ten (10) contractors. To ensure an appropriate contractors fit for a particular project, each of these trades shall contain a reasonably equal distribution of small, medium and large contractors. The lesser used or specialize contractors such as welders can be limited to 3 to 5. 
 h. It is recognized that some of our properties are remote from other properties, say in the larger cities and that not all the same contractors in those cities service that property. In this case that remote property is to use as many of those that do service the property and then supplement it with contractors that service that area. 
 i. Where possible, it is strongly encouraged to utilize the same contractors that service more than one region. This will reinforce the benefits enumerated above. 
 j. Many regions already have an approved contractors list in existence. This list shall be reviewed and modified in accordance with this Standard Operating Procedure. 
 k. All contractors to be considered on the approved contractors list are to be thoroughly vetted with regard to references, reputation, responsiveness, quality of service, fair pricing and be given a copy of the Tishman Speyer Responsible Contractor Policy. The contractors are to provide written confirmation, as per Exhibit 2, that they comply with the Tishman Speyer Responsible Contractors Policy before they are placed on the list. 
 l. As in all areas there may be exceptions. If a particular trade is unique and does not have any contractor that can meet the intent of the Responsible Contractors Policy this should be brought up to the attention of the person overseeing the approved contractors list before they are added to the list. 
 m. Approved contractors lists are to be periodically updated, but not longer than every three years. 
 n. It should be clearly identified, on each city or regions approved contractors list, which contractors are qualified to be W MBE s. 
 o. Copies of the approved contractors list for each city, region, or remote building are to be posted on the portal.

 b. Tishman Speyer recognizes the limitations of adhering to this Policy in situations where Tishman Speyer does not have full discretion or where Tishman Speyer determines that the Policy s requirements are not appropriate or practical for the particular local market or situation. Where, under these conditions, adherence to this Policy is not appropriate or practical in the context of Tishman Speyer s fiduciary duties or otherwise, Tishman Speyer, using its best judgment, may permit certain contractors to be excluded from compliance with this Policy. 
 c. This Policy shall apply to contractors of construction and building operational services. This Policy shall not apply to administrative services, such as clerical work.

 TERMINATION FEE CALCULATION FORMULA 

The Maximum Termination Fee Amount is calculated as the sum of two (2) components (a) up to 5,400,000.00 of reimbursable architectural MEP costs, and (b) an amount equal to the January 1, 2023 net present value NPV ), calculated using the Microsoft Excel XNPV function (or its equivalent), of monthly cash flows discounted at a 4.0 rate, representing 7.50 per RSF per annum on the then-Agreed Area of the Office Premises beginning on the Rent Commencement Date and continuing for the duration of the Term (as if the Lease had not been sooner terminated). For instance, assuming Tenant maintains the Agreed Area of the Office Premises of 189,226 RSF, the January 1, 2023 NPV of the spread would equal 18,212,167 and the total Maximum Termination Fee Amount in such case would equal 23,612,167. Assuming Tenant exercises its Pre-CD Expansion Option for a revised Agreed Area of the Office Premises of 212,784 RSF, the January 1, 2023 NPV of the spread would equal 20,479,521 and the total Maximum Termination Fee Amount in such case would equal 25,879,521. Alternatively, if Tenant exercises its Pre-CD Contraction Option to reduce its Agreed Area of the Office Premises by 16,000 RSF to a revised Agreed Area of the Office Premises of 173,226 RSF, the January 1, 2023 NPV of the spread would equal 16,672,238 and the total Maximum Termination Fee Amount in such case would equal 22,072,238.

 (iii) If for any reason any Swing Loan cannot be refinanced by Alternate Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.4(c)(i), the request for Alternate Base Rate Loans submitted by the applicable Swing Bank as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by such Swing Bank that each of the Banks fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Loan and each Bank s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Swing Bank pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
 
 (iv) If any Bank fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Swing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Bank pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4(c) by the time specified in Section 2.4(c)(i), the applicable Swing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Bank (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Swing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate Basis and a rate determined by such Swing Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such Swing Bank in connection with the foregoing.

 25 
 AMERICAS 2023306744.4

No such Supplement shall require the approval or consent of any Bank whose Commitment is not being increased, and no Bank shall be required to agree to increase its Commitment. Upon the execution and delivery of such Supplements as provided above and the occurrence of the Effective Date specified therein, and upon the Administrative Agent administering the reallocation of the outstanding Loans ratably among the Banks after giving effect to each such increase in the Commitments (and the payment by the Borrowers of any amounts under Section 4.9 if such Effective Date is not the last day of an Interest Period for any outstanding Loan), and the delivery of certified evidence of partnership authorization and a legal opinion in substantially the form of Exhibit I hereto on behalf of the Borrowers, this Credit Agreement shall be deemed to be amended accordingly.

 (ii) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Government Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month and three month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month and three month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 
 then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus 0.10 for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Credit Agreement (the Successor Rate ). 
 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus 0.10 , all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 4.4(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers may amend this Credit Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 4.4 at the end of any Interest Period or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in 
 
 36 
 AMERICAS 2023306744.4 

the United States for such alternative benchmark. and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Borrowers unless, prior to such time, Banks comprising the Majority Banks have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Majority Banks object to such amendment. 
 
 The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrowers and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero , the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Credit Agreement provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrowers and the Banks reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 
 1.1 Illegality . Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any present or future Government Mandate shall make it unlawful for any Bank to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, such Bank shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to the Borrowers and the other Banks and thereupon (a) the commitment of such Bank to make Term SOFR Loans or convert Federal Funds Rate Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall forthwith be suspended, and (b) such Bank s Loans then Outstanding as Term SOFR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Federal Funds Rate Loans on the last day of each then existing Interest Period applicable to such Term SOFR Loans or within such earlier period after the occurrence of such circumstances as may be required by Government Mandate.

 (e) impose on any Bank or the Administrative Agent any other conditions, cost or expense or requirements with respect to this Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loans, such Bank s Commitment, or any class of loans or commitments of which any of the Loans or such Bank s Commitment forms a part, and the result of any of the foregoing is

 (iii) to require such Bank or the Administrative Agent to make any payment that, but for such conditions or requirements described in clauses (a) through (d), would not be payable hereunder, or forego any interest or other sum that, but for such conditions or requirements described in clauses (a) through (d), would be payable to such Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder, in any case the amount of which payment or foregone interest or other sum is deemed by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to be material and is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by such Bank or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers hereunder, then, and in each such case, the Borrowers will, upon demand made by such Bank or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time (such demand to be made in any case not later than the first to occur of (I) the date one year after such event described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) giving rise to such demand, and (II) the date ninety (90) days after both the payment in full of all Outstanding Loans, and the termination of the Commitments) and as often as the occasion therefor may arise, pay to such Bank or the Administrative Agent such additional amounts as will be sufficient to compensate such Bank or the Administrative Agent for such additional cost, reduction, payment, foregone interest or other sum. Subject to the terms specified above in this Section 4.6, the obligations of the Borrowers under this Section 4.6 shall survive repayment of the Loans and termination of the Commitments.

 1.1 Capital Adequacy . If after the date hereof any Bank or the Administrative Agent determines that (a) the adoption of or change in any Government Mandate (whether or not having the force of law) regarding capital or liquidity requirements for banks or bank holding companies or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by any Government Authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (b) compliance by such Bank or the Administrative Agent, or any corporation controlling such Bank or the Administrative Agent, with any Government Mandate (whether or not having the force of law) has the effect of reducing the return on such Bank s or the Administrative Agent s commitment with respect to any Loans to a level below that which such Bank or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent could have achieved but for such adoption, change, or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank s or the Administrative Agent s then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity and assuming full utilization of such Entity s capital) by any amount reasonably deemed by such Bank or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent to be material, then such Bank or the Administrative Agent may notify the Borrowers of such fact. To the extent that the amount of such reduction in the return on capital is not reflected in the Federal Funds Rate, the Borrowers shall pay such Bank or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent for the amount of such reduction in the return on capital as and when such reduction is determined upon presentation by such Bank or (as the case may be) the Administrative Agent of a certificate in accordance with Section 4.8 hereof (but in any case not later than the first to occur of (I) the date one year after such adoption, change, or compliance causing such reduction, and (II) as to adoptions of or changes in Government Mandates occurring prior to the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments the date ninety (90) days after both the payment in full of all Outstanding Loans and termination of the Commitments).

Based on the latest valuation of each Guaranteed Pension Plan (which in each case occurred within fifteen (15) months of the date of the representation), and on the actuarial methods and assumptions employed for that valuation, the aggregate benefit liabilities of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans within the meaning of 4001 of ERISA did not exceed the aggregate value of the assets of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans by more than 100,000,000, disregarding for this purpose the benefit liabilities and assets of any Guaranteed Pension Plan with assets in excess of benefit liabilities. The administrator of any Guaranteed Pension Plan has not provided notice of an intent to terminate such Guaranteed Pension Plan, pursuant to Section 4041(a)(2) of ERISA (including any such notice with respect to a plan amendment referred to in Section 4041(e) of ERISA). The conditions for imposition of a lien under Section 303(k) of ERISA have not been met with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan. A determination that any Guaranteed Pension Plan is in at risk status (within the meaning of Section 303 of ERISA) has not been made. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate a Guaranteed Pension Plan pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA, nor has any event or condition described in Section 4042 of ERISA that constitutes grounds for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, such Guaranteed Pension Plan occurred. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or is reasonably expected to incur any Withdrawal Liability to a Multiemployer Plan which would be reasonably expected to result in a liability of more than 100,000,000. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has been notified by the sponsor of a Multiemployer Plan that such Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of ERISA) or has been determined to be in endangered or critical status within the meaning of Section 432 of the Code or Section 305 of ERISA and no Multiemployer Plan is reasonably expected to be in endangered or critical status.

 If any Interest Payment Date for any Floating Rate Note (other than an Interest Payment Date occurring on the Maturity Date) would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if such Business Day falls in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day, unless otherwise specified in the Supplement. If the Maturity Date of a Floating Rate Note falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such maturity. 
 Interest payments on each Interest Payment Date for Floating Rate Notes will include accrued interest from and including the Issue Date or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date. 
 
 1 In addition, Notes may be issued utilizing index rates other than those set forth herein, including, without limitation, SOFR, BSBY, Ameribor, and OBFR, and such index rates may be incorporated by (i) modifying this Statement of Terms through the Supplement to accommodate such alternative index rates, or (ii) expressly modifying the Statement of Terms to include such index rates.

On the Maturity Date, the interest payable on a Floating Rate Note will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity Date. Accrued interest will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount of a Floating Rate Note by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal) for each such day will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such day by 360, in the cases where the Base Rate is the Commercial Paper Rate, Federal Funds Rate or Prime Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year, in the case where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate. The interest rate in effect on each day will be (i) if such day is an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date (as defined below) pertaining to such Interest Reset Date, or (ii) if such day is not an Interest Reset Date, the interest rate with respect to the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the next preceding Interest Reset Date, subject in either case to any adjustment by a Spread and or a Spread Multiplier. 
 The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Commercial Paper Rate will be the second Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate will be the Business Day next preceding an Interest Reset Date. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is the Treasury Rate will be the day of the week in which such Interest Reset Date falls when Treasury Bills are normally auctioned. Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is held on the following Tuesday or the preceding Friday. If an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Interest Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Date occurring in the next succeeding week. The Interest Determination Date where the Base Rate is a rate other than a specific rate set forth in this paragraph will be as set forth in the Supplement. 
 The Index Maturity is the period to maturity of the instrument or obligation from which the applicable Base Rate is calculated. 
 The Calculation Date, where applicable, shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day following the applicable Interest Determination Date or (ii) the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date. 
 All times referred to herein reflect New York City time, unless otherwise specified. 
 The Issuer shall specify in writing to the Issuing and Paying Agent which party will be the calculation agent (the Calculation Agent with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date with respect to such Floating Rate Note to the Issuing and Paying Agent as soon as the interest rate with respect to such Floating Rate Note has been determined and as soon as practicable after any change in such interest rate. 
 All percentages resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five-one millionths of a percentage point rounded upwards. For example, 9.876545 (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655 (or .0987655). All dollar amounts used in or resulting from any calculation on Floating Rate Notes will be rounded, in the case of U.S. dollars, to the nearest cent or, in the case of a foreign currency, to the nearest unit (with one-half cent or unit being rounded upwards).
