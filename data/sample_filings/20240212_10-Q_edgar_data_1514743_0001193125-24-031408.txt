 The IF Bancorp, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Incentive Plan was approved by stockholders in 2012 for a ten-year
 period which ended in November 2022. The purpose of the Equity Incentive Plan was to promote the long-term financial success of the Company and its Subsidiaries by providing a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who contribute to such success and to further align their interests with those of the Company s stockholders. The Equity Incentive Plan authorized the issuance or delivery to participants of up to shares of the Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified
 stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, provided that the maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options) was and the maximum number of shares of Company stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units was . This plan was replaced by the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan when the stockholders approved the new plan on November 21, 2022. The new plan authorizes the issuance or delivery to participants of up to shares of the Company common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified
 stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, provided that the maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options) was and the maximum number of shares of Company stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units was .

and as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023. 
 The Company believes that sound loans are a necessary and desirable means of employing funds available for investment. Recognizing the Company s obligations to its depositors and to the communities it serves, authorized personnel are expected to seek to develop and make sound, profitable loans that resources permit and that opportunity affords. The Company maintains lending policies and procedures designed to focus our lending efforts on the types, locations, and duration of loans most appropriate for our business model and markets. The Company s lending activity includes the origination of one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans, multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity lines of credit, and to a lesser extent, consumer loans (consisting primarily of automobile loans), construction loans and land loans. The primary lending market includes the Illinois counties of Vermilion, Iroquois, Champaign and Kankakee, as well as the adjacent counties in Illinois and Indiana. The Company also has a loan production office in Osage Beach, Missouri, which serves the Missouri counties of Camden, Miller, and Morgan. Generally, loans are collateralized by assets, primarily real estate, of the borrowers and guaranteed by individuals. The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrowers or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers. 
 Management reviews and approves the Company s lending policies and procedures on a routine basis. Management routinely (at least quarterly) reviews our allowance for credit losses and reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing
 and potential problem loans. Our underwriting standards are designed to encourage relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Relationship banking implies a primary banking relationship with the borrower that includes, at minimum, an active deposit banking relationship in addition to the lending relationship. The integrity and character of the borrower are significant factors in our loan underwriting. As a part of underwriting, tangible positive or negative evidence of the borrower s integrity and character are sought out. Additional significant underwriting factors beyond location, duration, the sound and profitable cash flow basis underlying the loan and the borrower s character are the quality of the borrower s financial history, the liquidity of the underlying collateral and the reliability of the valuation of the underlying collateral. 
 The Company s policies and loan approval limits are established by the Board of Directors. The structure of the Company s loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors through its Operating Committee, consisting of the Chairman and up to four other Board members. At no time is a borrower s total borrowing relationship to exceed our regulatory lending limit. Loans to related parties, including executive officers and the Company s directors, are reviewed for compliance with regulatory guidelines and the Board of Directors at least annually. 
 The Company conducts internal loan reviews that validate the loans against the Company s loan policy quarterly for mortgage, consumer, and small commercial loans on a sample basis, and all larger commercial loans on an annual basis. The Association also receives independent loan reviews performed by a third party on larger commercial loans to be performed annually. In addition to compliance with our policy, the loan review process reviews the risk assessments made by our credit department, lenders and loan committees. Results of these reviews are presented to management, Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. 
 The Company s lending can be summarized into six primary areas: one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, home equity lines of credits, real estate construction, commercial business loans, and consumer loans. 
 One-
 to four-family Residential Mortgage Loans 

The Company offers one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting standards (conforming loans) as well as non-conforming
 loans. In recent years there has been an increased demand for long-term fixed-rate loans, as market rates have dropped and remained near historic lows. As a result, the Company has sold a substantial portion of the fixed-rate one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of years or greater. Generally, the Company retains fixed-rate one-
 to four-family residential mortgage loans with terms of less than years, although this has represented a small percentage of the fixed-rate loans originated in recent years due to the favorable long-term rates for borrowers. 

and as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Generally, these loans are collateralized by multi-family and nonresidential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows or from proceeds from the sale of the properties of the borrower. 
 Purchased Loans and Loan Participations 

The Company s loans receivable included purchased loans of and at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. All of these purchased loans are secured by single family homes located out of our primary market area, but still primarily in the Midwest. The Company s loans receivable also include commercial loan participations of and at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, of which and , at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 were outside our primary market area.

Management s opinion as to the ultimate collectability of loans is subject to estimates regarding future cash 
flows from operations and the value of property, real and personal, pledged as collateral. These estimates are affected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of borrowers. 
 The allowance for credit losses represents the Company s best estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. The provision for credit losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by the Company as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, the Company relies on a sound credit review and approval process. The review process is directed by the overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty.

The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar risk characteristics, while some loans are selected to be evaluated individually. At December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, no non-performing
 loans were individually evaluated and no specific reserve was established.

restructured loans in foreclosure as of December 31, 2023 or as of June 30, 2023. The Company defines a default as any loan that becomes days or more past due. 
 Specific loss allowances are included in the calculation of estimated future loss ratios, which are applied to the various loan portfolios for purposes of estimating future losses. 
 Management considers the level of defaults within the various portfolios, as well as the current adverse economic environment and negative outlook in the real estate and collateral markets when evaluating qualitative adjustments used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. We believe the qualitative adjustments more accurately reflect collateral values in light of the sales and economic conditions that we have recently observed.

 As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio is currently set at . The Association opted into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio in 2020. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Association met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject and was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Association s prompt corrective action category.

Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are not historical facts, but rather are statements based on management s current expectations regarding its business strategies and their intended results and IF Bancorp, Inc. s the Company future performance. Forward-looking statements are preceded by terms such as expects, believes, anticipates, intends and similar expressions. Management s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our actual results include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, changes in the interest rate environment, legislative or regulatory changes that may adversely affect our business, changes in accounting policies and practices, changes in competition and demand for financial services, adverse changes in the securities markets and changes in the quality or composition of the Association s loan or investment portfolios. Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors , in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the Company s other filings with the SEC. These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. IF Bancorp, Inc. assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as may be required by law. Overview On July 7, 2011 we completed our initial public offering of common stock in connection with the Association s mutual-to-stock conversion, selling 4,496,500 shares of common stock at 10.00 per share, including 384,900 shares sold to the Association s employee stock ownership plan, and raising approximately 45.0 million of gross proceeds. In addition, we issued 314,755 shares of our common stock to the Iroquois Federal Foundation. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has repurchased a total of 1,674,479 shares of common stock under stock repurchase plans. The Company is a savings and loan holding company and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Company s business activities are limited to oversight of its investment in the Association. The Association is primarily engaged in providing a full range of banking and mortgage services to individual and corporate customers within a 100-mile radius of its locations in Watseka, Danville, Clifton, Hoopeston, Savoy, Champaign, and Bourbonnais, Illinois, and Osage Beach, Missouri. The principal activity of the Association s wholly-owned subsidiary, L.C.I. Service Corporation, is the sale of property and casualty insurance. The Association is subject to regulation by the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of savings and transaction accounts, certificates of deposit, and Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago advances. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income consists primarily of customer service fees, brokerage commission income, insurance commission income, net realized gains on loan sales, mortgage banking income, net gain on foreclosed assets and income on bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing, professional fees, marketing, office supplies, and federal deposit insurance premiums. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our net interest rate spread (the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities) was 1.88 and 3.10 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net interest income decreased to 9.0 million, or 18.0 million on an annualized basis, for the six months ended December 31, 2023 from 12.3 million, or 24.6 million on an annualized basis, for the six months ended December 31, 2022.

Our emphasis on conservative loan underwriting has historically resulted in relatively low levels of non-performing assets. Our non-performing loans totaled 29,000, or 0.1 , of total loans at December 31, 2023, and 117,000, or 0.1 , of total loans at June 30, 2023. Our non-performing assets totaled 36,000, or 0.1 of total assets at December 31, 2023, and 148,000, or 0.1 , of total assets at June 30, 2023. At December 31, 2023, the Association was categorized as well capitalized under regulatory capital requirements. Our net income for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was 651,000, compared to a net income of 3.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Association. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Critical Accounting Policies We define critical accounting policies as those policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies. Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is established by factors considered by the Company during the evaluation of the overall adequacy of the allowance which include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and loan modifications for borrowers with financial difficulties, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, effective July 1, 2022, and utilizes a current expected credit loss CECL methodology which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. Based on our estimate of the level of allowance for credit losses required, we record a provision for credit losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level. The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar risk characteristics. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for individually evaluated loans by evaluating them separately. The Company also uses the CECL model to calculate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as undrawn amounts on lines of credit. While the allowance for credit losses on loans is reported as a contra-asset asset for loans, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is reported as a liability. The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are subject to significant revision as more information becomes available. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for credit losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.

Income Tax Accounting. The provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements, rather than amounts reported on our income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Under U.S. GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, our forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carryback years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods, while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Any required valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability, which could adversely affect our future income tax expense. There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in IF Bancorp, Inc. s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 Total assets increased 61.8 million, or 7.3 , to 910.8 million at December 31, 2023 from 849.0 million at June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 66.1 million increase in net loans receivable, partially offset by a 2.8 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a 1.4 million decrease in investment securities. Net loans receivable, including loans held for sale, increased by 66.1 million, or 11.3 , to 653.6 million at December 31, 2023 from 587.5 million at June 30, 2023. The increase in net loans receivable during this period was due primarily to a 39.0 million, or 43.5 , increase in multi-family loans, a 21.9 million, or 11.3 , increase in commercial real estate loans, a 12.0 million, or 7.3 , increase in one- to four-family loans, a 1.4 million, or 17.7 , increase in home equity lines of credit, and a 4.0 million, or 5.0 , increase in commercial business loans, partially offset by an 11.1 million, or 21.7 , decrease in construction loans and a 340,000, or 4.1 , decrease in consumer loans. Investment securities, consisting entirely of securities available for sale, decreased 1.4 million, or 0.7 , to 199.9 million at December 31, 2023 from 201.3 million at June 30, 2023. We had no securities classified as held to maturity at December 31, 2023 or June 30, 2023. Between June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable increased 977,000 to 3.8 million, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock increased 2.3 million to 5.4 million, while premises and equipment decreased 238,000 to 10.9 million, foreclosed assets held for sale decreased 24,000 to 7,000, mortgage servicing rights decreased 72,000 to 1.4 million, deferred income taxes decreased 728,000 to 10.3 million, and other assets decreased 2.0 million to 1.7 million. The increase in accrued interest receivable was primarily the result of increases in both the average balances and yields of loans and the average yields of securities, while the increase in FHLB stock was due to an increased stock requirement due to an increase in FHLB advances. The decrease in premises and equipment was the result of ordinary depreciation and the decrease in foreclosed assets held for sale was due to the sale of property.

Table of Contents 

The decrease in mortgage servicing rights was the result of a decreased valuation, while the decrease in deferred income taxes was mostly due to a decrease in unrealized losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities and the decrease in other assets was due to the receipt of a large accounts receivable item in the six months ended December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, our investment in bank-owned life insurance was 15.0 million, an increase of 206,000 from 14.8 million at June 30, 2023. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. Federal regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25 of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for credit losses, which resulted in a limit of 23.3 million at December 31, 2023. Deposits decreased 57.3 million, or 7.8 , to 678.0 million at December 31, 2023 from 735.3 million at June 30, 2023. Certificates of deposit, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, increased 22.0 million, or 8.3 , to 286.1 million, while brokered certificates of deposit increased 12.4 million, or 63.6 , to 32.0 million. Noninterest bearing demand accounts decreased 62.1 million, or 57.8 , to 45.4 million, while savings, NOW, and money market accounts decreased 29.6 million, or 8.6 , to 314.5 million. The large decrease in noninterest bearing demand accounts was due primarily to approximately 62.1 million in deposits from a public entity that collects real estate taxes that was on deposit at June 30, 2023 and withdrawn in the six months ended December 31, 2023, when tax monies were distributed. Repurchase agreements increased 5.3 million, or 48.7 , to 16.0 million at December 31, 2023, from 10.8 million at June 30, 2023. Borrowings consisted of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago which increased 78.6 million to 98.1 million at December 31, 2023 from 19.5 million at June 30, 2023. Other borrowings increased 34.4 million and consisted of 9.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window and 25.4 million from the FRB Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). Accrued interest payable increased 1.2 million, or 71.0 , to 2.8 million at December 31, 2023, from 1.7 million at June 30, 2023, while the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures decreased 160,000 to 56,000 at December 31, 2023 from 216,000 at June 30, 2023, and other liabilities decreased 2.1 million, or 35.0 , to 4.0 million at December 31, 2023 from 6.1 million at June 30, 2023. The increase in accrued interest payable was mostly due to increases in both the average balance and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures was due to decreases in loans with unfunded balances without the Bank s ability to cancel on demand, and the decrease in other liabilities was a result of accrued compensation and benefits that were paid out in the six months ended December 31, 2023. Total equity increased 2.0 million, or 2.8 , to 73.7 million at December 31, 2023 from 71.8 million at June 30, 2023. Equity increased primarily due to a decrease of 1.7 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, net income of 651,000, and ESOP and stock equity plan activity of 307,000. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily due to a decrease in unrealized depreciation on available-for-sale securities, net of tax. These increases were partially offset by approximately 639,000 in dividends to our shareholders. Comparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 General. Net income decreased 2.7 million to 651,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 3.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income was due to a decrease in net interest income, an increase in provisions for credit losses, and a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 3.3 million, or 27.0 , to 9.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 12.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. This was a result of an increase of 7.7 million in interest expense, partially offset by an increase of 4.3 million in interest and dividend income. Our interest rate spread decreased by 122 basis points to 1.88 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 3.10 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and our net interest margin decreased by 104 basis points to 2.16 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 3.20 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. A 67.8 million, or 10.0 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 59.5 million, or 7.7 , increase in average balance of interest earnings assets.

Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 4.3 million, or 28.6 , to 19.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 15.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to a 4.2 million increase in interest income on loans, a 54,000 increase in interest income on securities, and a 46,000 increase in other interest income. The increase in interest income on loans resulted from a 81 basis point, or 18.3 , increase in the average yield on loans to 5.26 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 from 4.45 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and by a 76.2 million, or 13.9 , increase in the average balance of loans to 624.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 548.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest income on securities was due to a 26 basis point increase in the average yield on securities to 2.89 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 from 2.63 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by a 15.2 million, or 7.3 , decrease in the average balance of securities to 194.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 210.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other interest income was a result of a 161 basis point increase in the average yield in other interest earning assets, including Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and deposits with other financial institutions, to 5.74 from 4.13 , partially offset by a 1.5 million decrease in the average balance of other interest earning assets. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 7.7 million, or 265.1 , to 10.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 2.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 6.1 million in interest on deposits and a 1.5 million increase in interest on borrowings and repurchase agreements. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 6.1 million, or 296.8 , to 8.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was due to a 190 basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to 2.57 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 from 0.67 for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and by an increase of 21.2 million in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 636.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 from 615.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Interest expense on borrowings, including FHLB advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and Bank Term Funding Program, and repurchase agreements, increased 1.5 million, or 186.5 , to 2.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 830,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings and repurchase agreements to 108.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 62.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, and by a 170 bp increase in the average cost of such borrowings to 4.38 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 2.68 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Provision (Credit) for Credit Losses. We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We recorded a provision for credit losses on loans for 747,000 and a credit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of (161,000) for a total provision for credit losses of 586,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for credit losses on loans of 75,000 and a credit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of (62,000) for a total provision for credit losses of 13,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses was 7.9 million, or 1.20 of total loans, at December 31, 2023, compared to 7.2 million, or 1.26 of total loans, at December 31, 2022, and 7.1 million, or 1.20 of total loans, at June 30, 2023. During the six months ended December 31, 2023, net recoveries of 49,000 were recorded, while during the six months ended December 31, 2022, net charge-offs of 8,000 were recorded.

 Noninterest Income . Noninterest income decreased 43,000, or 2.1 , to 2.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income, net, and a decrease in brokerage commissions, partially offset by an increase in net realized gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities and an increase in gain on sale of loans. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, mortgage banking income, net, decreased 132,000 to 92,000 and brokerage commissions decreased 120,000 to 319,000, while net realized gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities increased 183,000 to 0 and the gain on sale of loans increased 34,000 to 110,000, from the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in mortgage banking income, net, was a result of a decrease in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and a decrease in loan servicing fees in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and the decrease in brokerage commissions was the result of a decrease in the amount of renewal commissions and management fees. The increase in net realized gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities was the result of securities sold at a loss in the six months ended December 31, 2022, and the increase in gain on sale of loans was a result of an increase in loans originated and sold through the FHLBC Mortgage Partnership Finance program in the six months ended December 31, 2023. Noninterest Expense . Noninterest expense decreased 214,000, or 2.2 , to 9.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, from 9.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The largest components of this decrease were compensation and benefits, which decreased 363,000, or 5.8 , advertising, which decreased 88,000, or 32.6 and professional services, which decreased 61,000, or 21.0 . These decreases were partially offset by an increase in federal deposit insurance premium, which increased 188,000, or 167.9 , and an increase in office occupancy expense, which increased 97,000, or 20.2 . Compensation and benefits decreased due to annual incentive plan decreases, advertising decreased due to less television advertising in the six months ended December 31, 2023, and professional services decreased due to additional services received during the six months ended December 31, 2022. The federal deposit insurance premium increased as a result of FDIC increasing the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate and office occupancy increased due to the addition of a new banking facility in Hoopeston. Income Tax Expense . We recorded a provision for income tax of 222,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for income tax of 1.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting effective tax rates of 25.4 and 26.7 , respectively. Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 General. Net income decreased 1.2 million to 185,000 net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 1.4 million net income for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in noninterest expense.

Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 2.1 million, or 26.2 , to 10.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 8.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest and dividend income was primarily due to a 2.1 million increase in interest income on loans. The increase in interest on loans resulted from a 68 basis point, or 14.4 , increase in the average yield on loans to 5.41 from 4.73 , and a 85.4 million, or 15.3 , increase in the average balance of loans to 644.0 million from 558.5 million. The increase in interest income on securities resulted from a 13 basis point, or 4.8 , increase in the average yield on securities to 2.87 from 2.74 , partially offset by a 10.0 million, or 4.9 , decrease in the average balance of securities to 194.0 million from 204.0 million. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 3.8 million, or 183.4 , to 5.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 2.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was due to an 185 basis point, or 154.7 , increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 3.05 from 1.20 , and a 75.6 million, or 11.0 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities to 765.0 million from 689.4 million. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by 2.9 million, or 200.5 , to 4.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to 2.73 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 0.94 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and a 19.0 million, or 3.1 , increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to 634.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 615.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

This increase was due to an increase in the average balance of borrowings to 130.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 73.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and a 126 basis point increase in the average cost of such borrowings to 4.62 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from 3.36 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Provision (Credit) for Credit Losses. We establish provisions for credit losses, which are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. We recorded a provision for credit losses on loans for 437,000 and a credit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for (73,000) for a total provision for credit losses of 364,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for credit losses on loans of 142,000 and a credit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures of (41,000) for a total provision for credit losses of 101,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, net recoveries of 48,000 were recorded, while during the three months ended December 31, 2022, net recoveries of 1,000 were recorded. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 47,000, or 5.4 , to 915,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from 868,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net realized gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking income, net, and a decrease in brokerage commissions. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, net realized gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities increased 183,000 to 0, mortgage banking income, net, decreased 95,000 to (48,000), and brokerage commissions decreased 44,000 to 157,000, from the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased 215,000, or 4.4 , to 4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from 4.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The largest components of this decrease were compensation and benefits, which decreased 251,000, or 8.1 , and advertising expense, which decreased 64,000, or 37.9 . These decreases were partially offset by an increase in federal deposit insurance, which increased 103,000, or 174.6 , and an increase in office occupancy expense, which increased 50,000, or 21.0 . Compensation and benefits decreased due to a decrease in annual incentive plan expenses and advertising decreased due to a new ad campaign in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The federal deposit insurance premium increased as a result of FDIC increasing the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate and office occupancy increased due to the addition of a new banking facility in Hoopeston. Income Tax Expense . We recorded a provision for income tax of 47,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a provision for income tax of 486,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, reflecting effective tax rates of 20.3 and 25.7 , respectively. Asset Quality At December 31, 2023, our non-accrual loans totaled 29,000 in commercial loans. At December 31, 2023, we had a single one- to four-family loan for 1,000 which was delinquent 90 days or greater and still accruing interest. At December 31, 2023, loans classified as substandard equaled 3.1 million. Loans classified as substandard consisted of 199,000 in one- to four-family loans, 239,000 in multi-family loans, 920,000 in commercial real estate loans, and 1.8 million in commercial business loans. At December 31, 2023, no loans were classified as doubtful or loss. At December 31, 2023, watch rated assets consisted of 80,000 in one-to four-family loans. Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings TDRs ). After adopting ASU 2022-02, effective July 1, 2023, we no longer held any TDRs and made no loan modifications for borrowers with financial difficulties in the six months ended December 31, 2023. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, we had TDRs which included loans for which economic concessions had been granted to borrowers with financial difficulties. We periodically modified loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help borrowers stay current on their loans and to avoid foreclosure. At December 31, 2023, we had no TDRs and at June 30, 2023, we had 215,000 in TDRs. Foreclosed Assets. At December 31 2023, we had 7,000 in foreclosed assets, compared to 31,000 as of June 30, 2023. Foreclosed assets at December 30, 2023 consisted of one vehicle, while foreclosed assets at June 30, 2023 consisted of 24,000 in residential real estate property and a 7,000 vehicle. Allowance for Credit Loss Activity The Company regularly reviews its allowance for credit losses and adjusts its balance based on management s analysis of the loan portfolio, the amount of non-performing and classified loans, as well as general economic conditions. Although the Company maintains its allowance for credit losses at a level that it considers sufficient to provide for losses, there can be no assurance that future losses will not exceed internal estimates. In addition, the amount of the allowance for credit losses is subject to review by regulatory agencies, which can order the establishment of additional loss provisions. The following table summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses over the six-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:

The allowance for credit losses has been calculated based upon an evaluation of pertinent factors underlying the various types and quality of the Company s loans. Management considers such factors as the repayment status of a loan, the estimated net fair value of the underlying collateral, the borrower s intent and ability to repay the loan, local economic conditions, and the Company s historical loss ratios. We maintain the allowance for credit losses through the provisions for credit losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for credit losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. The allowance for credit losses increased 796,000 to 7.9 million at December 31, 2023, from 7.1 million at June 30, 2023. This increase in allowance was primarily the result of an increase in our loan portfolio and was necessary in order to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level that reflects management s best estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loans. Within each pool, risk elements are evaluated that have specific impacts to the borrowers within the pool. These, along with the general risks and events, and the specific lending policies and procedures by loan type, are analyzed to estimate the qualitative factors used to adjust the historical loss rates. Factors considered by the Company during the evaluation of the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and loan modifications for borrowers with financial difficulties, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, increased operating costs for businesses, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumer s ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve, and management has included a qualitative factor within the ACL. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period.

While management believes that our asset quality remains strong, it recognizes that, due to the continued growth in the loan portfolio and the potential changes in market conditions, our level of nonperforming assets and resulting charges-offs may fluctuate. Higher levels of net charge-offs requiring additional provisions for credit losses could result. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan sales and repayments, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, and maturities of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers, as well as unanticipated contingencies. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the six months ended December 31, 2023, and the year ended June 30, 2023, our liquidity ratio averaged 25.7 , 26.5 and 29.3 of our total assets, respectively. We believe that we had enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and long-term liquidity needs as of December 31, 2023. We regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (i) expected loan demand; (ii) expected deposit flows; (iii) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (iv) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and medium-term securities. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are affected by our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled 8.2 million. Interest-earning time deposits which can offer additional sources of liquidity, totaled 750,000 at December 31, 2023. Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows included in our financial statements. Net cash provided by operating activities were 1.1 million and 551,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively. Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by net cash provided by principal collections on loans, and proceeds from maturing securities, the sale of securities and pay-downs on mortgage-backed securities. Net cash used in investing activities was (64.2) million and (35.3) million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities consisted primarily of the activity in deposit accounts and FHLB Advances. The net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 60.3 million and (32.6) million for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company must also maintain adequate levels of liquidity to ensure the availability of funds to satisfy loan commitments. The Company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments principally through the use of current liquid assets and through its borrowing capacity discussed above. The following table summarizes these commitments at December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023.

At December 31, 2023, certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2023 totaled 287.8 million, or 42.4 of total deposits. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits, our line of credit or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before December 31, 2024. Moreover, it is our intention as we continue to grow our commercial real estate portfolio, to emphasize lower cost deposit relationships with these commercial loan customers and thereby replace the higher cost certificates with lower cost deposits. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements, which provide an additional source of funds, exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Federal Reserve Discount Window, Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program, and CIBC Bank USA. Federal Home Loan Bank advances were 98.1 million, while we had borrowings of 10.0 million from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) Discount Window and 24.4 million from the FRB Bank Term Funding Program at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023 we had the ability to borrow up to an additional 8.5 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, we had 14.0 million available from CIBC Bank, and also had the ability to borrow 13.7 million from the Federal Reserve based on current collateral pledged. The Association is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Association s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Association must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of the Association s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Association s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors. The Basel III regulatory capital framework (the Basel III Capital Rules adopted by U.S. federal regulatory authorities, among other things, (i) establish the capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital instruments meeting stated requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) set forth the acceptable scope of deductions/adjustments to the specified capital measures. In addition, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity and the buffer applies to all three measurements: Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital. As a result of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than 10 billion. A qualifying community bank that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered well capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action statutes. The Community Bank Leverage Ratio is currently set at 9 . The Association opted into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio in 2020. As of December 31, 2023, the Association was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Association s prompt corrective action category. The Association s Community Bank Leverage Ratio is presented in the table below.

 Average Balances and Yields The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at and for the periods indicated. Yields and costs are presented on an annualized basis. Tax-equivalent yield adjustments have not been made for tax-exempt securities. All average balances are based on month-end balances, which management deems to be representative of the operations of the Company. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.

Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated to the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of change in each.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk An internal interest rate risk analysis is performed at least quarterly to assess the Company s Earnings at Risk and Value at Risk.
