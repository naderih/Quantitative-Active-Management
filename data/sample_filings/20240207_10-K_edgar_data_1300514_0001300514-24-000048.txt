We focus on the mass market, which comprises our most profitable gaming segment. We believe the mass market segment will continue to deliver long-term growth as a result of continuing economic growth, expansion of the middle class and increasing number of high net worth individuals across our markets in Asia. We also offer loyalty programs at our properties, which provide access to rewards, privileges and members-only events.

 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements. See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Our principal operating and developmental activities occur in two geographic areas: Macao and Singapore. Management reviews the results of operations for each of its operating segments, which generally are our Integrated Resorts. In Macao, our operating segments are: The Venetian Macao; The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao; and Sands Macao. In Singapore, our operating segment is Marina Bay Sands. Additionally, prior to its sale, our operating segment in the United States was The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center (together, the Las Vegas Operating Properties through February 22, 2022, which has been disclosed as a discontinued operation. We also review construction and development activities for our primary projects under development, in addition to our reportable segments noted above. We also have ferry operations and various other operations that are ancillary to our Macao properties (collectively, Ferry Operations and Other ). 
 Strengths and Strategies 
 We believe we have a number of strengths that differentiate our business from our competitors, including: 
 Diversified, high quality Integrated Resort offerings with substantial non-gaming amenities. Our Integrated Resorts feature non-gaming attractions and amenities including world-class entertainment, expansive retail offerings and market-leading MICE facilities. These attractions and amenities enhance the appeal of our Integrated Resorts, contributing to visitation, length of stay and customer spending at our resorts. The broad appeal of our market-leading Integrated Resort offerings in our various markets enables us to serve the widest array of customer segments in each market. 
 Substantial and diversified cash flow from existing operations. Our Integrated Resorts in Macao and Singapore have contributed 54 and 46 of our total adjusted property EBITDA, respectively, during 2023. In each of these jurisdictions, our cash flow from operations was derived from a combination of gaming and non-gaming sources, including retail malls, hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and MICE. 
 Market leadership in the growing high-margin mass market gaming segment. In our gaming business, we focus on the high-margin mass gaming segment. Our combined SCL properties continue to have the highest percentage of gaming win from mass tables and slots of the Macao operators. Management estimates our mass market table revenues typically generate a gross margin substantially higher than the gross margin on our VIP table

 revenues. Additionally, gross gaming revenue from mass tables and slots has contributed to approximately two-thirds of total gross gaming revenue at Marina Bay Sands during the previous five years. 
 Established brands with broad regional and international market awareness and appeal. Through a combination of its diversity of amenities, scale of facilities and its distinctive design, The Venetian Macao has remained the foremost example of a themed Integrated Resort in Macao. The Londoner Macao, our largest themed property on the Cotai Strip, with replicas of the Houses of Parliament and the Elizabeth Tower, along with the Parisian Macao, our themed property with an iconic replica of the Eiffel Tower and other attractions, has established an interconnected critical mass of Europe an-themed Integrated Resorts that attract multiple segments of leisure and business tourism and drive broad brand awareness both regionally and globally. As awareness of The Londoner Macao increases, we believe this Integrated Resort has both the quality and scale to enhance the overall reputation and recognition of our Macao portfolio. 
 Marina Bay Sands is an iconic, architecturally significant Integrated Resort with meaningful scale and visitation. Due to its distinctive design, multitude of amenities and customer experiences shared on social media, and a prominent position as part of the Singapore skyline, Marina Bay Sands is recognized throughout Asia and globally. We believe the brand of Marina Bay Sands is unique and as a result, the property is often featured prominently on social media, in filmed entertainment and in other media. 
 Experienced management team with a proven track record. Mr. Robert G. Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been an integral part of our executive team from the beginning, joining our founder and previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson, before The Venetian Resort Las Vegas was constructed. Mr. Goldstein is one of the most respected and experienced executives in our industry today. Mr. Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has been with the Company for more than 13 years, including previously serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and has prior experience in corporate finance and management. Our management team is focused on delivering growth, increasing our return on invested capital, balance sheet strength, preserving the Company s financial flexibility to pursue development opportunities and continuing to execute return of capital to stockholders. 
 Unique MICE and entertainment facilities. Our market-leading MICE and entertainment facilities contribute to our markets diversification and appeal to business and leisure travelers while diversifying our cash flows and increasing revenues and profit. Our approximately 2.9 million square feet of global MICE space is designed to meet the needs of meeting planners and corporate events and trade show organizers from around the world. Our experience and expertise in this industry supports our ability to drive leisure and business tourism to our markets. The live entertainment program at our properties has been a key traffic driver and has established us as a leader in the field of tourism and leisure activities. 
 Building on our key strengths, we seek to enhance our position as the leading developer and operator of Integrated Resorts and casinos by continuing to implement the following business strategies: 
 Developing and diversifying our Integrated Resort offerings to include a full complement of products and services to cater to different market segments. Our Integrated Resorts include MICE space, retail, dining and entertainment facilities and a range of hotel offerings, including branded suites and hotel rooms, to cater to different segments of our markets. We are able to leverage the recognition and the sales, marketing and reservation capabilities of premier hotel brands to attract a wide range of customers in different market segments to our properties. We believe our partnerships with renowned hotel management partners, our diverse Integrated Resort offerings and the convenience and accessibility of our properties will continue to increase the appeal of our properties to both the business and leisure customer segments. 
 Leveraging our scale of operations to create and maintain an absolute cost advantage. Management expects to benefit from lower unit costs due to the economies of scale inherent in our operations. Opportunities for lower unit costs include, but are not limited to: lower utility costs; more efficient staffing of hotel and gaming operations; and centralized transportation, marketing and sales, and procurement. In addition, our scale allows us to consolidate certain administrative functions.

 Focusing on the high-margin mass market gaming segment, while continuing to provide luxury amenities and high service levels to our VIP and premium players. The scale and product mix of our Integrated Resort properties allow us to participate very effectively in all segments of the market. We believe the mass market segment will continue to exhibit long-term growth as a result of continuing economic growth, expansion of the middle class and increasing number of high net worth individuals across our markets in Asia, accompanied by supportive long-term trends in business and leisure tourism. Our properties are positioned to harness future growth in the mass market that comprise our most profitable gaming segment, while delivering the immersive destination resort experiences that create loyalty with VIP and premium players. 
 Identifying targeted investment opportunities to drive growth across our portfolio. We will continue to invest in the expansion of our facilities and the enhancement of the leisure and business tourism appeal of our property portfolio. Our planned development projects include fulfilling capital and operating investment requirements as part of our Macao gaming concession, the next phase of renovation and redevelopment of The Londoner Macao and the extensive renovation and expansion of Marina Bay Sands.

The Sands Macao also includes a 289-suite hotel tower, spa facilities and several restaurants and entertainment areas. 
 We operate the gaming areas within our Macao properties pursuant to a 10-year gaming concession that expires in December 2032. See Regulation and Licensing Macao Concession . 
 Singapore 
 Marina Bay Sands opened with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites located in three 55-story hotel towers. We are currently undertaking extensive renovation work with approximately 1,850 rooms and suites resulting upon completion, which is expected to greatly enhance the positioning of our suite product. Atop the three towers is the Sands SkyPark, an extensive outdoor recreation area with a 150-meter infinity swimming pool and leading restaurant and nightlife brands. The Integrated Resort offers approximately 162,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 500 table games and 3,000 slot machines and ETGs; The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an enclosed retail, dining and entertainment complex with signature restaurants from world-renowned chefs; an event plaza and promenade; and an art/science museum.

 We operate the gaming area within our Singapore property pursuant to a 30-year casino concession provided under a development agreement entered into in August 2006. See Regulation and Licensing Development Agreement with Singapore Tourism Board. Additionally, see Development Projects Singapore. 
 Our Markets 
 Macao 
 Macao is the largest gaming market in the world and the only market in China to offer legalized casino gaming. According to Macao government statistics issued publicly on a monthly basis by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (commonly referred to as the DICJ ), annual gross gaming revenues were 183.06 billion patacas in 2023 (approximately 22.74 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), an increase of 333.8 and a decrease of 37.4 compared to 2022 and 2019, respectively. 
 We welcomed approximately 27 million visitors to Macao in 2023, compared to the approximately 6 million visitors in 2022. We believe visitation will return to pre-pandemic levels and will continue to experience meaningful long-term growth. We believe this growth will be driven by a variety of factors, including the movement of Chinese citizens to urban centers in China, continued growth of the Chinese outbound tourism market, the increased utilization of existing transportation infrastructure, the introduction of new transportation infrastructure and the continued increase in hotel room inventory in Macao and neighboring Hengqin Island. There has been significant investment announced and recently completed by concessionaires in new resort development projects on Cotai. These factors should help increase the critical mass on Cotai and further drive Macao's transformation into a leading business and leisure tourism hub in Asia. We believe the development of additional integrated resort products in Macao will also drive a higher demand for gaming products. 
 Table games are the dominant form of gaming in Asia, with Baccarat being the most popular game. We believe we will continue to experience Macao market-leading visitation and are focused on driving high-margin mass market gaming, while providing luxury amenities and high service levels to our VIP and premium players. We

Table of Contents 

 intend to continue to introduce more modern and popular products that appeal to the Asian marketplace and believe our continued improvement in our high-quality gaming product offerings has enabled us to capture a meaningful share of the overall Macao gaming market across all player segments. 
 Proximity to Major Asian Cities 
 Visitors from Hong Kong, South China, Taiwan and other locations in Asia can reach Macao in a relatively short time, using a variety of transportation methods, and visitors from more distant locations in Asia can take advantage of short travel times by air to Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou or Hong Kong, followed by a road, ferry or helicopter trip to Macao. In addition, numerous air carriers fly directly into Macau International Airport from many major cities in Asia. 
 Macao draws in a significant number of customers who are visitors or residents of Hong Kong. One of the major methods of transportation to Macao from Hong Kong is the jetfoil ferry service, including our ferry services, Cotai Water Jet. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (the HZMB ), which connects Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai, has reduced the travel time between Hong Kong and Macao from one hour by ferry to approximately 45 minutes on the road. The HZMB is part of the Greater Bay Area Initiative and plays a key role in connecting the cities in the Greater Bay Area, facilitating the visitation to Macao. Macao is also accessible from Hong Kong by helicopter. 
 Competition in Macao 
 Gaming in Macao is administered by the government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires, of which we are one. The other concessionaires are SJM Resorts, S.A., Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A., Galaxy Casino, S.A., MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. and Melco Resorts (Macau), S.A. 
 Our Macao operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations, both in Asia and globally. 
 Singapore 
 Singapore is regarded as having the most developed financial and transportation infrastructure in the Southeast Asia region. Singapore has established itself as a destination for both business and leisure visitors, offering convention and exhibition facilities as well as world-class shopping malls and hotel accommodations. In 2006, after a competitive bid process, the Singapore government awarded two concessions to develop and operate two integrated resorts. We were awarded the concession for the Marina Bay site, which is adjacent to Singapore's central business district, and Genting International was awarded the second site, located on Singapore's Sentosa Island. 
 Based on figures released by the STB, Singapore welcomed approximately 13.6 million international visitors in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, a 115.8 increase and a 28.8 decrease compared to the same period in 2022 and 2019, respectively. Tourism receipts were estimated to be SGD 14.18 billion (approximately 10.74 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in 2022 (the latest information publicly available at the time of filing). The Gambling Regulatory Authority (the GRA ), the gaming regulator in Singapore, does not disclose gaming revenue for the market and thus no official figure exists. 
 We believe Marina Bay Sands is ideally positioned within Singapore to cater to both business and leisure visitors. The Integrated Resort is centrally located within a 20-minute drive from Singapore's Changi International Airport and near the Marina Bay Cruise Center, a deep-water cruise ship terminal, and Bayfront station, a mass rapid transit station. Marina Bay Sands is also located near several entertainment attractions, including the Gardens by the Bay botanical gardens and the Singapore Sports Hub, a sports complex featuring the 55,000-seat National Stadium. 
 Baccarat is the preferred table game in both VIP and mass gaming. Additionally, contributions from slot machines and from mass gaming, including ETG offerings, have enhanced the growth of the market. As Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore market as a whole continue to mature, we expect to broaden our visitor base to continue to capture visitors from around the world.

 Proximity to Major Asian Cities 
 More than 100 airlines operate in Singapore, connecting it to some 300 cities in approximately 80 countries. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 59 million passengers passed through Singapore's Changi Airport, an increase of 83 and a decrease of 14 compared to the same period in 2022 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, Changi Jewel, a multi-use retail, hotel and food and beverage destination, opened at Changi Airport, and work is currently underway to expand the number of runways and open a fifth terminal, which would increase passenger capacity. Based on figures released by the STB, the largest source markets for visitors to Singapore over the last five years ending in 2023 were China and Indonesia. The STB's methodology for reporting visitor arrivals does not recognize Malaysian citizens entering Singapore by land, although this method of visitation is generally thought to be substantial. 
 Competition in Singapore 
 Gaming in Singapore is administered by the government through the award of licenses to two operators, our Company and Resorts World Sentosa, which is 100 owned by Genting Singapore PLC. The GRA is required to ensure there will not be more than two casino licenses until January 1, 2031. 
 Our Singapore operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations, both in Asia and globally. 
 Retail Mall Operations 
 We own and operate retail malls at our Integrated Resorts at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao and Marina Bay Sands. We currently own approximately 2.8 million square feet of gross retail space. Management believes being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia will provide meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow. 
 Our malls are designed to complement our other unique amenities and service offerings provided by our Integrated Resorts. Our strategy is to seek out desirable tenants that appeal to our patrons and provide a wide variety of shopping options. We generate our mall revenue primarily from leases with tenants through base minimum rents, overage rents and reimbursements for common area maintenance CAM and other expenditures. For further information related to the financial performance of our malls, see Part II Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 Talent Management 
 We directly employ approximately 38,700 employees worldwide, including approximately 38,400 full-time employees, and hire additional temporary employees on an as-needed basis. Of our full-time employees, approximately 49 are female. 
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and motivate skilled managers and employees at our properties. Our strategy is to be the employer of choice by ensuring a thriving workforce built on integrity and opportunity and to support our employees personal, professional and financial well-being. We strive to enhance our culture by creating a safe environment that consists of an inclusive and diverse workforce where all employees are treated fairly and equally and can excel in the performance of their duties. Some examples of key programs and initiatives we have implemented to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include: 
 Competitive pay;

 physical and mental health, such as a free Employee Assistance Program for employees and their household, which provides information regarding nutrition, disease management, stress reduction and injury prevention; 
 Retirement benefits: all eligible employees are able to participate in retirement planning schemes, which may include contributions from the employer, as well as the employee; 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Program: through policies, procedures, hiring practices and support systems, we seek to promote diversity, equity and inclusion and integrate these values into our Company;

 Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relations with our employees and any relevant union. 
 Commitment to Environmental Sustainability 
 We focus significant attention on minimizing our environmental impact with the goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our existing properties and offsetting the impact of new developments. Through Sands ECO360, we endeavor to adapt to emerging trends, support new technologies and foster environmental stewardship in the areas of building design and development, resort management and operations, and meetings, events and entertainment. The program is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other key environmental standards in the areas of low carbon transition, water stewardship, waste, materials and resources and biodiversity. 
 Our Environmental, Social and Governance Report (the Report is available on our website and contains further information on our environmental sustainability performance, including data indices that reflect the reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The contents of the Report and our website are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file or furnish with the SEC, and any reference to the Report and our website are intended to be inactive textual references only. 
 In addition to our internal initiatives, we have developed the Drop by Drop Project, a collaborative water stewardship initiative in conjunction with Clean the World Foundation. The Drop by Drop Project is designed to encourage sustainability in our local regions and reinvests capital from our water stewardship efforts into innovative water projects in Macao and Singapore. 
 Development Projects 
 We regularly evaluate opportunities to improve our product offerings, such as refreshing our meeting and convention facilities, suites and rooms, retail malls, restaurant and nightlife mix and our gaming areas, as well as other revenue generating additions to our Integrated Resorts. 
 Macao 
 Under the Concession (defined below) with the Macao government, Venetian Macau Limited VML, a subsidiary of Sands China Ltd.) is obligated to invest a total of 30.24 billion patacas (approximately 3.76 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) by the year 2032. These investments are to be allocated to both capital and operational projects, including 27.80 billion patacas (approximately 3.45 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) for a variety of non-gaming projects designed to enhance Macao's appeal to an international audience (the Investment Plan ). 
 The Concession requires us to increase our investment in non-gaming projects by up to 20 in the following year if Macao s annual market gross gaming revenue achieves or exceeds 180 billion patacas (approximately 22.36 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). Macao s annual market gross gaming revenue amounted to 183.06 billion patacas (approximately 22.74 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 2023). Consequently, we are required to invest, or cause to be invested, an additional 5.56 billion patacas (approximately 691 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in non-gaming investment projects by December 2032. 
 Key areas of the investment are subject to the approval of the Macao government and include the following: 
 MICE Facility Expansion . We plan to expand our convention sector capabilities by constructing a state-of-the-art MICE facility. This new venue, encompassing roughly 18,000 square meters, will adjoin our existing Venetian Macao exhibition center (the Cotai Expo ). Our goal is to broaden our capacity for large-scale international events, which will be supported by enhanced organization and marketing strategies aimed at making Macao a preferred locale for global corporations' major gatherings. 
 Tropical Garden Redevelopment . Le Jardin, located on the southern flank of The Londoner Macao, is to undergo a transformation into a distinctive garden-themed attraction spanning approximately 50,000 square meters. Featuring an iconic conservatory and an array of themed green spaces, this development is intended to become a celebrated Macao landmark that offers a compelling, year-round experience for both tourists and local residents. 
 Entertainment . Our Investment Plan includes a broadening of our entertainment and sporting event portfolio, which will include substantial upgrades to the Cotai Arena. 
 We have commenced works on Phase II of the Londoner Macao, which includes the renovation of the rooms in the Sheraton and Conrad hotel towers, an upgrade of the gaming areas and the addition of new attractions, dining, retail and entertainment offerings. These projects have a total estimated cost of 1.2 billion and are expected to be substantially completed in early 2025 . 
 Singapore 
 In April 2019, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. MBS and the Singapore Tourism Board (the STB entered into the Second Development Agreement pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a development, which will include a hotel tower with luxury rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats. 
 The Second Development Agreement provides for a total minimum project cost of approximately SGD 4.5 billion (approximately 3.4 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). The estimated cost and timing of the total project will be updated as we complete design and begin construction. We expect the total project cost will materially exceed the amounts referenced above from April 2019 based on current market conditions due to inflation, higher material and labor costs and other factors. We have incurred approximately 1.09 billion as of December 31, 2023, inclusive of the payment made in 2019 for the lease of the parcels of land underlying the MBS Expansion Project site. 
 On March 22, 2023, MBS and the STB entered into a supplemental agreement (the Supplemental Agreement ), which extended the construction commencement date to April 8, 2024 and the construction completion date to April 8, 2028, and allowed for changes to the construction and operation plans under the Second Development Agreement. 
 We amended our 2012 Singapore Credit Facility to provide for the financing of the development and construction costs, fees and other expenses related to the MBS Expansion Project pursuant to the Second Development Agreement. On September 7, 2021, we amended the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the deadline for delivering the construction cost estimate and the construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project to March 31, 2022. As noted above, we are in the process of completing the design and reviewing the budget and timing of the MBS expansion due to various factors. As a result, the construction cost estimate and construction schedule were not delivered to the lenders by the extended deadline, and we will not be permitted to make further draws on the Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility until these items are delivered. We do not anticipate material spend related to the MBS Expansion Project prior to the delivery of these items to lenders. 
 We are nearing completion of the renovation of Towers 1 and 2 of Marina Bay Sands. This renovation has introduced world class suites and other luxury amenities at a cost estimated at approximately 1.0 billion upon 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 completion. We also announced the next phase with the renovation of the Tower 3 hotel rooms into world class suites and other property changes at an estimated cost of approximately 750 million with an expected completion date by 2025. These renovations at Marina Bay Sands are substantially upgrading the overall guest experience for our premium customers, including new dining and retail experiences, and upgrading the casino floor, among other things. These projects are in addition to the previously announced plans for the MBS Expansion Project. 
 New York 
 On June 2, 2023, we paid 241 million to acquire Nassau Live Center, LLC and related entities (the Nassau Coliseum ), the owners and operators of an entertainment arena in the State of New York. The purchase of the Nassau Coliseum, which continues to operate following the closing of the sale, primarily included the fixed assets related to the arena and the right to lease the underlying land from the owner, the County of Nassau in the State of New York. 
 In conjunction with this transaction, the seller assigned their lease of the land on which the related assets, including the Nassau Coliseum and other improvements, are affixed (the Original Lease to the Company. Immediately following this assignment, the Company entered into a new land lease agreement with the County of Nassau (the County in the State of New York, for the use and exclusive right to develop and operate assets on the land (the New Lease ). On April 18, 2023, Hofstra University Hofstra filed a petition against the Nassau County Planning Commission (the Planning Commission in the New York Supreme Court, County of Nassau, asserting, among other things, that certain meetings held by the Planning Commission concerning the New Lease and certain related transactions were not properly noticed and/or held, and that appropriate materials concerning the meetings were not made available to the public by the Planning Commission in connection with the meetings. On May 31, 2023, Hofstra filed an amended petition that, among other things, added additional respondents and sought to invalidate certain votes held by the County and the Nassau County Legislature. The Company is not a party to these proceedings. 
 In a decision and order dated November 9, 2023, the Court annulled various votes held by the Nassau County Legislature, annulled the New Lease and remitted the matter to the Planning Commission and the Nassau County Legislature to conduct a proper public hearing in accordance with all relevant statutes and rules, including the Nassau County Administrative Code and the Open Meetings law and for the issuance of a positive declaration pursuant to the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act and for the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (the Procedural Steps ). On November 10, 2023, the respondents appealed the decision and order and on November 21, 2023, Hofstra cross-appealed. On December 13, 2023, the Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department denied respondents motion to stay enforcement of the decision and order pending the appeal, but granted a calendar preference, indicating that the appeal will be calendared expeditiously after all briefs have been filed. With the invalidation of the New Lease noted above, the Company became the lessee in the Original Lease. On January 29, 2024, Hofstra filed a motion seeking a declaration that the Court s prior order included the annulment of Nassau County s consent and the putative assignment to the Company of the Original Lease. We are committed to working with Nassau County to ensure that the Procedural Steps are conducted; however, there can be no assurance as to the completion or positive outcome of the Procedural Steps or our ability to secure a new lease on terms that are favorable to us. 
 We purchased the Nassau Coliseum with the intent to obtain a casino license from the State of New York to develop and operate an Integrated Resort. In addition to the resolution of the matter noted above regarding the New Lease by the Planning Commission, there is no assurance we will be able to obtain a casino license from the State of New York. 
 Other 
 We continue to evaluate additional development projects in each of our markets and pursue new development opportunities globally. 
 Regulation and Licensing 
 Macao Concession 
 On December 16, 2022, the Macao government granted VML, SCL's wholly owned subsidiary, one of six concessions to operate casinos in Macao. VML entered into a concession agreement with the Macao government for 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 the duration of ten years, beginning January 1, 2023 (the Concession ). With the expiry of VML s subconcession on December 31, 2022, all of our casinos, gaming areas and respective supporting areas located in Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao, with a total approximate area of approximately 136,000 square meters (representing approximately 4.7 of the total property area of these entities), reverted to and are now owned by the Macao government. Effective January 1, 2023, all these casinos and gaming areas, as well as respective supporting areas, have been temporarily transferred to VML for the duration of the Concession in return for annual payments of 750 patacas per square meter for the first three years and 2,500 patacas per square meter for the following seven years (approximately 93 and 311, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). These annual payments will be adjusted annually based on the Macao average price index for the preceding year. Under the Concession, we are obligated to operate casino games of chance in Macao. The Concession allows us to operate the casino and gaming areas located in the following properties: Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and the Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao. We are required to invest, or cause to be invested, at least 30.24 billion patacas (approximately 3.76 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), including 27.80 billion patacas (approximately 3.45 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) on non-gaming projects. As part of the investment, we are obligated to develop certain gaming and non-gaming investment projects by December 2032 and dedicate resources to, among others, the attraction of international visitors, conventions and exhibitions, entertainment shows, sporting events, culture and art, health and wellness, and themed attractions, as well as support Macao's position as a city of gastronomy and increase community and maritime tourism. The Concession requires us to increase our investment in non-gaming projects by up to 20 in the following year if Macao s annual market gross gaming revenue achieves or exceeds 180 billion patacas (approximately 22.36 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). Macao's annual gross gaming revenue amounted to 183.06 billion patacas (approximately 22.74 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in 2023. Consequently, we are required to invest, or cause to be invested, an additional 5.56 billion patacas (approximately 691 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in non-gaming investment projects by December 2032. 
 We are subject to licensing and control under applicable Macao law and are required to be licensed by the Macao gaming authorities to operate a casino. We must pay periodic and regular fees and taxes, and our gaming license is not transferable. We must periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macao gaming authorities and furnish any other information the Macao gaming authorities may require. No person may acquire any rights over the shares or assets of VML without first obtaining the approval of the Macao gaming authorities. Similarly, no person may operate the casino premises for which the use has been temporarily transferred to us, either through a management agreement or any other contract or through step in rights without first obtaining the approval of, and receiving a license from, the Macao gaming authorities. The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of VML or other rights relating to such shares, and any act involving the granting of voting rights or other stockholders' rights to persons other than the original owners, would require the approval of the Macao government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macao gaming authorities. 
 Our Concession and the applicable Macao laws require, among other things: (i) approval of the Macao government for transfers of shares in VML, or of any rights over or inherent to such shares, including the grant of voting rights or other stockholder's rights to persons other than the original owners, as well as for the creation of any charge, lien or encumbrance on such shares; (ii) approval of the Macao government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any of our direct or indirect stockholders, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5 of VML's share capital; (iii) that the Macao government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance or the grant of voting rights or other stockholder's rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in VML, provided that such shares or rights are equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5 of VML's share capital; (iv) that the Macao government be given notice of listing on a stock exchange by any indirect stockholders holding shares equal to or higher than 5 of VML's share capital; and (v) that the Macao government be given prior notice of any relevant financial decision exceeding 10 of the share capital of VML five days before that decision is taken. The requirements in provisions (ii) and (iii) above will not apply, however, to securities listed as tradable on a stock exchange. VML and any of its subsidiaries where VML is a dominant shareholder cannot be listed in any stock exchange.

 The Macao gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, us to determine whether our suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by this individual. LVSC and SCL shareholders with 5 or more of the share capital, directors and key employees must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the Concession term, and accept the persistent and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macao government. VML is required to notify the Macao government immediately should VML become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5 or more of the share capital, or any officer, director or key employee. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Macao gaming authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Macao gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in corporate position. If the Macao gaming authorities were to find one of our officers, directors or key employees unsuitable for licensing, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Macao gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. 
 Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macao gaming authorities may be found unsuitable. Any stockholder found unsuitable who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a company incorporated in Macao and registered with the Macao Companies and Moveable Assets Registrar (a Macao registered corporation beyond the period of time prescribed by the Macao gaming authorities may lose their rights to the shares. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us, we: 
 pay that person any dividend or interest upon its shares; 
 allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through shares held by that person; 
 pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or 
 fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require that unsuitable person to relinquish its shares. 
 The Macao gaming authorities also have the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation holding a gaming license. 
 In addition, the Macao gaming authorities require prior approval for any loan or similar financing transaction above 100 million patacas (approximately 12 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) where VML is a borrower or a lender, or where it involves the creation of liens and encumbrances over VML's assets and restrictions on stock. 
 Macao gaming authorities also require to be given prior notice of any relevant financial decision five days before that decision is taken, including but not limited to internal movement of funds exceeding 50 of the share capital of VML, and any other decision exceeding 10 of the share capital of VML, namely labor-related decisions such as payment of salaries and employment benefits. 
 The Macao gaming authorities must give their prior approval to changes in control of VML through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisition, management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Macao registered corporation must satisfy the Macao gaming authorities concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. The Macao gaming authorities may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the transaction. 
 The Macao gaming authorities may consider some management opposition to corporate acquisitions, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Macao gaming licensees, and the Macao registered corporations affiliated with such operations, to be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. 
 The Concession requires the Macao gaming authorities' prior approval of any recapitalization plan proposed by VML's Board of Directors. The Chief Executive of Macao could also require VML to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary. 
 The Concession also allows the Macao government to request various changes in the plans and specifications of our Macao properties and to make various other decisions and determinations that may be binding on us. For 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 example, the Macao government has the right to require that we contribute additional capital to our Macao subsidiaries or that we provide certain deposits or other guarantees of performance in any amount determined by the Macao government to be necessary. VML is limited in its ability to raise additional capital by the need to first obtain the approval of the Macao gaming and governmental authorities before raising certain debt or equity. 
 The Concession requires VML to submit to the Macao government an annual execution proposal of the specific projects mentioned in the Concession s Investment Plan up to three months before the start of each calendar year, detailing each project it intends to execute, the proposed amount and the execution schedule for the relevant year. The annual execution proposal for the year 2023 was submitted on March 31, 2023. Within two months after submission of each annual execution proposal, the Macao government will decide on their approval, and may request adjustments to specific projects, to the investment amount and to the execution schedule. If any of our annual execution proposals or parts thereof are not approved, VML is obliged to propose allocating the relevant funds to other projects related with its activity, which are also subject to approval of the Macao government. Within three months after the end of each calendar year, VML is required to submit a report on the execution of the previous year s execution proposal. In addition, VML is subject to the supervision of the Macao government as regards the execution of development projects included in the Concession s Investment Plan, and VML must submit regular progress reports every two months, and may be requested to submit exceptional detailed reports whenever the normal progress of any development project is compromised. 
 If our Concession is terminated in the event of a default, the casinos and gaming-related equipment would be automatically transferred back to the Macao government without compensation to us and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. In many of these instances, the Concession does not provide a specific cure period within which any such events may be cured and, instead, we would rely on consultations and negotiations with the Macao government to give us an opportunity to remedy any such default. 
 Our Concession allows us to operate games of chance in casinos and gaming areas, but excludes the following gaming activities: mutual bets, lotteries, raffles, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling activities on ships or planes. Our Concession is exclusively governed by Macao law. We are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Macao in case of any dispute or conflict relating to our Concession. 
 Our Concession expires on December 31, 2032. If our Concession is not extended or renewed, VML may be prohibited from conducting gaming operations in Macao, and we could cease to generate revenues from our gaming operations when our Concession expires. In addition, all casino premises and gaming-related equipment, which use has been temporarily transferred by the Macao government to VML, will be transferred back to the Macao government upon the expiry of our Concession, together with any gaming-related equipment we acquire during our Concession, without any compensation to us. 
 Under our Concession, we are obligated to pay to the Macao government an annual gaming premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated by us. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas (approximately 4 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusively for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine, including slot machines (approximately 37,274, 18,637 and 124, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), subject to a minimum of 76 million patacas (approximately 9 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). We also have to pay a special gaming tax of 35 of gross gaming revenues and applicable withholding taxes. We are also obligated to pay a special annual gaming premium if the average of the gross gaming revenues of our gaming tables and our electrical or mechanical gaming machines, including slot machines, is lower than a certain minimum amount determined by the Macao government; such special premium being the difference between the special gaming tax based on the actual gross gaming revenues and that of the specified minimum amount. The minimum amount has been set by the Macao government at 7 million patacas per gaming table and 300,000 patacas per gaming machine (approximately 1 million and 37,274, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). Based on the maximum number of gaming tables and gaming machines we are currently authorized to operate, if the monthly special gaming taxes paid during the year aggregates to less than 4.50 billion patacas (approximately 560 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), we would be required to pay the difference as the special annual gaming premium. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not have to pay a special gaming premium 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 under the Concession requirements as the special gaming taxes were higher than the minimum threshold. We must also contribute 5 of our gross gaming revenue to utilities designated by the Macao government, a portion of which must be used for the promotion of tourism in Macao. 
 Currently, the gaming tax in Macao is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue; however, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for credit losses. As a result, if we extend credit to our customers in Macao and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we have to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers even though we were unable to collect on the related receivables. If the laws are not changed, our business in Macao may not be able to realize the full benefits of extending credit to our customers. 
 In August 2018, we received an exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period of January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022, and in September 2022, this exemption was extended to December 31, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expired. On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that VML and its peers would continue to receive this exemption for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. 
 We entered into an agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for payments as a substitution for a 12 tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits, namely a payment of 38 million patacas (approximately 5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) for 2021 and a payment of 18 million patacas (approximately 2 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) for the period between January 1, 2022 through June 26, 2022. We are in discussions with the Macao government regarding a similar agreement, which would commence effective as of January 1, 2023. 
 Development Agreement with Singapore Tourism Board 
 On August 23, 2006, MBS entered into a development agreement, as amended by a supplementary agreement on December 11, 2009 (the Development Agreement ), with the STB to design, develop, construct and operate the Marina Bay Sands. The Development Agreement includes a concession for MBS to own and operate a casino within the Integrated Resort. In addition to the casino, the Integrated Resort includes, among other amenities, a hotel, a retail complex, a convention center and meeting room complex, a theater, restaurants and an art/science museum. MBS is one of two companies awarded a concession to operate a casino in Singapore. Under the request for proposals to develop an integrated resort at Marina Bay, Singapore, during an initial ten-year exclusive period (the Exclusivity Period only two licensees were granted the right to operate a casino in Singapore, which expired on February 28, 2017. This Exclusivity Period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2030, when the Second Development Agreement (see below) was entered into. In connection with entering into the Development Agreement, MBS entered into a 60-year lease with the STB for the parcels underlying the project site and entered into an agreement with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore for the provision of necessary infrastructure for rapid transit systems and road works within and/or outside the project site. During the Exclusivity Period, the Company, which is currently the 100 indirect shareholder of MBS, was required to be the single largest entity with direct or indirect controlling interest of at least 20 in MBS, unless otherwise approved by the GRA. 
 The term of the casino concession provided under the Development Agreement is for 30 years commencing from the date the Development Agreement was entered into, or August 23, 2006. In order to renew the casino concession, MBS must give notice to the STB and other relevant authorities in Singapore at least five years before its expiration in August 2036. The Singapore government may terminate the casino concession prior to its expiration in order to serve the best interests of the public, in which event fair compensation will be paid to MBS. 
 In April 2019, MBS and the STB entered into the Second Development Agreement pursuant to which MBS has agreed to construct a development, which will include a hotel tower with luxury rooms and suites, a rooftop attraction, convention and meeting facilities and a state-of-the-art live entertainment arena with approximately 15,000 seats. The Second Development Agreement provides for a total minimum project cost of approximately SGD 4.5 billion (approximately 3.4 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). In connection with the Second Development Agreement, MBS entered into a lease with the STB for the parcels of land underlying the project (the Land ). In April 2019 and in connection with the lease, MBS provided various governmental agencies in Singapore the required premiums, deposits, stamp duty, goods and services tax and other fees in an aggregate amount of approximately SGD 1.54 billion (approximately 1.14 billion at exchange rates in effect at the time of the 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 transaction). The estimated cost and timing of the total project will be updated as we complete design and begin construction. We expect the total project cost will materially exceed the amounts referenced above from April 2019 based on current market conditions due to inflation, higher material and labor costs and other factors. We have incurred approximately 1.09 billion as of December 31, 2023, inclusive of the payment made in 2019 for the Land. 
 On March 29, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement with the STB to extend the construction commencement date for the MBS Expansion Project from April 8, 2022 to April 8, 2023. On March 22, 2023, MBS and the STB entered into the Supplemental Agreement, which further extended the construction commencement date to April 8, 2024 and the construction completion date to April 8, 2028, and allowed for changes to the construction and operation plans under the Second Development Agreement. 
 We amended our 2012 Singapore Credit Facility to provide for the financing of the development and construction costs, fees and other expenses related to the MBS Expansion Project pursuant to the Second Development Agreement. On September 7, 2021, we amended the 2012 Singapore Credit Facility, which, among other things, extended the deadline for delivering the construction cost estimate and the construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project to March 31, 2022. As noted above, we are in the process of completing the design and reviewing the budget and timing of the MBS expansion due to various factors. As a result, the construction cost estimate and construction schedule were not delivered to the lenders by the extended deadline, and we will not be permitted to make further draws on the Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility until these items are delivered. We do not anticipate material spend related to the MBS Expansion Project prior to the delivery of these items to lenders. 
 The Development Agreement contains, among other things, restrictions limiting the use of the leased land to the development and operation of the project, requirements that MBS obtain prior approval from the STB in order to subdivide the hotel and retail components of the project, prohibitions on any such subdivision during the Exclusivity Period and limitations on MBS' ability to assign the lease or sub-lease any portion of the land during the Exclusivity Period. In addition, the Development Agreement contains events of default, including, among other things, the failure of MBS to perform its obligations under the Development Agreement and events of bankruptcy or dissolution. 
 Employees whose job duties relate to the operations of the casino are required to be licensed by the relevant authorities in Singapore. MBS also must comply with comprehensive internal control standards or regulations concerning advertising; branch office operations; the location, floor plans and layout of the casino; casino operations including casino-related financial transactions and patron disputes, issuance of credit and collection of debt, relationships with and permitted payments to gaming promoters; security and surveillance; casino access by Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans; compliance functions and the prevention of money laundering; periodic standard and other reports to the GRA; and those relating to social controls including the exclusion of certain persons from the casino. 
 There is a goods and services tax of 7 imposed on gross gaming revenue, which, effective January 1, 2023, increased to 8 , and a casino tax imposed on the gross gaming revenue from the casino after reduction for the amount of goods and services tax. With effect from March 1, 2022, the casino tax rates of 5 for premium players and 15 for mass players were increased to 8 and 18 on gross gaming revenue up to SGD 2.4 billion and SGD 3.1 billion (approximately 1.8 billion and 2.3 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), respectively. On gross gaming revenue above the stated thresholds, the new casino tax rates are 12 for premium players and 22 for mass players. The bad debts written off from the extension of credit granted to gaming patrons is not deductible against gross gaming revenue when calculating the casino tax, but is deductible for the purposes of calculating the goods and services tax (subject to the prevailing law). MBS is permitted to extend casino credit to persons who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents, but is not permitted to extend casino credit to Singapore citizens or permanent residents except to premium players. 
 The key constraint imposed on the casino under the Development Agreement is the total size of the gaming area, which must not be more than 15,000 square meters (approximately 161,000 square feet). The following are not counted towards the gaming area: back of house facilities, reception, restrooms, food and beverage areas, retail shops, stairs, escalators and lift lobbies leading to the gaming area, aesthetic and decorative displays, performance areas and major aisles. Under the Development Agreement, the casino located within Marina Bay Sands could not have more than 2,500 gaming machines (although this restriction has been modified by the Second Development 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 Agreement as described below), but there is no limit on the number of tables for casino games permitted in the casino. 
 Under the Casino Control Act, as amended (the Singapore Act ), a casino operator may be subject to a financial penalty, for each ground of disciplinary action which amounts to a serious breach, of a sum not exceeding 10 of the annual gross gaming revenue (as defined in the Singapore Act) of the casino operator for the financial year immediately preceding the date the financial penalty is imposed. 
 The Singapore Act also requires future applicants and/or renewals for a casino license to be a suitable person to develop, maintain and promote the Integrated Resort as a compelling tourist destination that meets prevailing market demand and industry standards and contributes to the tourism industry in Singapore. The Singapore government has established an evaluation panel that will assess applicants and report to the GRA on this aspect of the casino licensing requirements. Our casino license, which has a three-year term, is set to expire in April 2025. 
 The Second Development Agreement contains provisions relating to the construction of the MBS Expansion Project and associated deadlines for completion, levels of insurance and limitations on MBS ability to assign the lease or sub-let any portion of the Land. In addition, the Second Development Agreement contains events of default, including, among other things, the failure of MBS to perform its obligations under the Second Development Agreement. The Second Development Agreement also contains, among other things, restrictions limiting the use of the Land to the development and operation of the MBS Expansion Project and requirements that MBS obtain the prior approval of the STB in order to subdivide the Land or any building thereon, which approval, if given, will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by the STB. 
 The Second Development Agreement makes provision for certain benefits and entitlements conferred on MBS on specified terms and conditions. Among these, upon the achievement of certain milestones, MBS is entitled to make available an additional 1,000 gaming machines over and above its existing 2,500 gaming machines. On October 7, 2019, MBS was granted entitlement to make available 500 of these additional 1,000 gaming machines. In addition, under the Second Development Agreement, MBS is granted approval for the change of use of the area comprising the whole of the 55th floor of Marina Bay Sands hotel tower 1, or such other areas as may be agreed within hotel tower 1, to be developed and used as part of Marina Bay Sands casino; and MBS is granted an option to purchase an additional 2,000 square meters of casino gaming area at a price to be determined by the relevant Singapore government authority upon written request by MBS to exercise the option. In addition, the Second Development Agreement contemplates that for a period of not less than 10 years commencing no sooner than March 1, 2022, the rate of casino tax applicable to MBS will not exceed specified tiered rates; there shall not be more than two casino licenses in force under the Casino Control Act at any time prior to January 1, 2031; and for a period of five years from the date of the Second Development Agreement, the entry levy payable by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident for entry into the casino will not exceed SGD 150 for a 24-hour period and SGD 3,000 for a 12-month period. The Second Development Agreement also provides for MBS to be entitled to compensation by STB for any losses or damages suffered under certain conditions and events related to the above-described benefits and entitlements. The Second Development Agreement further provides MBS must maintain compliance with the material terms of the Second Development Agreement to obtain the above-described benefits and entitlements. 
 Doing Business in Macao, Hong Kong and Mainland China 
 We are a parent company with limited business operations of our own, and our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. A significant portion of our business operations are based in Macao and held by various Macao-incorporated indirect subsidiaries of SCL, our majority-owned subsidiary incorporated in Cayman Islands and listed in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as the Macao Operations ). We also have subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China and Hong Kong that provide back-office support, such as information technology, accounting, hotel management and marketing services, which complement and support SCL s main back-office functions in Macao. 
 We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties relating to having a majority of our operations based in Macao and held by various Macao-incorporated indirect subsidiaries of SCL. Substantially all of SCL s assets are located in Macao and substantially all of SCL s revenue is derived from Macao. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial position and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal situation in Macao. From December 20, 1999, Macao became a Special Administrative Region of China when China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao. The Basic Law of Macao provides that Macao will be 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 governed under the principle of one country, two systems with its own separate government and legislature and that Macao will have a high degree of legislative, judicial and economic autonomy. 
 We also face risks and uncertainties associated with evolving Chinese laws and regulations, such as those associated with the extent to which the level of Chinese government involvement, control of capital inflows and outflows, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources currently applicable within mainland China may become applicable to us and other risks and uncertainties as to whether and how recent Chinese government statements and regulatory developments, such as those relating to data and cyberspace security and anti-monopoly which, where applicable to us, could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless and affect our ability to list securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. If, in the future, there were to be a significant change in the manner in which the Chinese government exercises direct or indirect oversight, discretion or control over businesses operated in Macao, mainland China and Hong Kong, including the current interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws and regulations on how the Chinese government exercises direct or indirect oversight, discretion or control over businesses operated in Macao, mainland China and Hong Kong, it could potentially result in our Macao Operations being materially adversely affected and it could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 
 As advised by our PRC legal advisers, Haiwen Partners, our Macao Operations are currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC ), Cyberspace Administration of China CAC or any other mainland Chinese governmental authority to operate its business or to issue securities to foreign investors, other than those related to its two subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China that only provide back office support. We have received all requisite permissions and approvals for the back-office supporting functions located in mainland China, primarily being the standard business licenses issued by the relevant authorities in mainland China, and we have never been denied such permissions and approvals. If we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals in relation to such back-office support functions, we do not expect there will be any material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event that we have inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required for our Macao Operations or if, in the future, applicable laws, regulations or interpretations were to change and require us to obtain such permissions or approvals, the failure to obtain such permissions or approvals could potentially result in penalties and other regulatory actions against us and may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, on December 2, 2021, the SEC adopted final amendments implementing the disclosure and submission requirements under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the HFCA Act ), pursuant to which the SEC will identify a Commission-Identified Issuer if an issuer has filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and will then impose a trading prohibition on an issuer after it is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for three consecutive years. If, in the future, we were to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer and have a non-inspection year, there is no assurance that we will be able to take remedial measures in a timely manner. On December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law, which reduced the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the listing and trading prohibitions under the HFCA Act from three years to two years. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB reported that it was able, in 2022, to inspect and investigate completely audit firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and that, as a result, the PCAOB voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. However, uncertainties remain whether the PCAOB can continue to make a determination in the future that it is able to inspect and investigate completely PCAOB-registered audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong.

 Transfers of Cash to and from Our Non-U.S. Subsidiaries 
 We are primarily dependent upon our properties in Macao and Singapore. We are a parent company with limited business operations of our own, our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our primary sources of cash are 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 royalties, dividends and distributions derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. Our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations, which may be impacted by various factors. 
 In addition, our Macao and Singapore credit facility agreements, under certain circumstances, may limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us. We expect future debt instruments issued by our subsidiaries for the financing of future developments may contain similar restrictions. 
 Subject to applicable law, any future dividend payments will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, taking into account various factors such as our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors. There can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in any particular amount, if at all, for any given period. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is reliant to some extent on the dividends received by SCL. In April 2020, we suspended our quarterly dividend program due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and in August 2023 the dividend program was reinstated. 
 The ability of subsidiaries to make distributions to us depends on the earnings and cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL, compliance with certain local statutes, the laws and regulations currently and in the future applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements. For example, our revenues in Macao are denominated in patacas, the legal currency of Macao, and in Hong Kong dollars. The Macao pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and, in many cases, is used interchangeably with the Hong Kong dollar in Macao. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. While currently there are no foreign exchange or capital control restrictions applicable to intercompany transactions between us and our Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China subsidiaries, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future and that our ability to convert large amounts of patacas into U.S. dollars over a relatively short period will not be limited. In addition, the mainland Chinese government also imposes controls on the convertibility of the renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China by our subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China. If, in the future, foreign exchange or capital control restrictions were to be imposed and become applicable to us, such restrictions could potentially reduce the amounts that we would be able to receive from our Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China subsidiaries. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including those located in Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China, held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 2.20 billion and restricted cash of 124 million as of December 31, 2023, of which approximately 1.80 billion is available to be repatriated, either in the form of dividends or via intercompany loans or advances, to the U.S., subject to the abovementioned restrictions. We do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. 
 Cash may be transferred between and among the Company and its subsidiaries through capital contributions, intercompany loans or advances, dividends, royalties and transfers of cash and other assets. The total net transfers to (from) the Company with SCL were 100 million, (978) million and 42 million and with Marina Bay Sands were 937 million, 74 million and 37 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Net transfers from its subsidiaries to SCL were 1.86 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and net transfers from SCL to its subsidiaries were 497 million and 385 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 2021, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, SCL made interest payments to the holders of the SCL Senior Notes in the amount of 346 million, 310 million and 352 million, respectively. There were no interim principal payments on the SCL Senior Notes.

 The Macao and Singapore governments could grant additional rights to conduct gaming in the future and increase competition we face. 
 Conducting business in Macao and Singapore has certain political and economic risks. 
 Our tax arrangements with the Macao government may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 
 We are subject to limitations on the transfers of cash to and from our subsidiaries, limitations of the pataca exchange markets and restrictions on the export of the renminbi.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of downturns in the economy. 
 Consumer demand for hotel/casino resorts, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities we offer is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or corporate spending on conventions and business travel could be driven by many factors, such as: perceived or actual general economic conditions; fear of exposure to a widespread health epidemic; any weaknesses in the job or housing market; credit market disruptions; high energy, fuel and food costs; the increased cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth; fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; or fear of war, political instability, civil unrest or future acts of terrorism. These factors could reduce consumer and corporate demand for the luxury amenities and leisure and business activities we offer, thus imposing additional limits on pricing and harming our operations. 
 Natural or man-made disasters, an outbreak of highly infectious or contagious disease, political instability, civil unrest, terrorist activity or war could materially adversely affect the number of visitors to our facilities and disrupt our operations. 
 So-called Acts of God, such as typhoons and rainstorms, particularly in Macao, and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, outbreaks of highly infectious or contagious diseases, political instability, civil unrest, terrorist activity or war may result in decreases in travel to and from, and economic activity in, areas in which we operate, and may adversely affect the number of visitors to our properties. We also face potential risks associated with the physical effects of climate change, which may include more frequent or severe storms, typhoons, flooding, extreme or prolonged heat, rising sea levels and shortages of water. To the extent climate change causes additional changes in weather patterns, our properties along the coast in Macao could be subject to an increase in the number and severity of typhoons and coastal and river flooding could cause damage to these properties, and all our properties could be subject to increased precipitation levels and heat stress. Any of these events may disrupt our ability to staff our business adequately, could generally disrupt our operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have insurance coverage with respect to some of these events, we cannot assure you any such coverage will provide any coverage or be sufficient to indemnify us fully against all direct and indirect costs, including any loss of business that could result from substantial damage to, or partial or complete destruction of, any of our properties. 
 Our business is sensitive to the willingness of our customers to travel. 
 We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel. Only a portion of our business is and will be generated by local residents. Most of our customers travel to reach our Macao and Singapore properties. Infectious diseases may severely disrupt domestic and international travel, which would result in a decrease in customer visits to Macao and Singapore, including our properties. Regional political events, acts of terrorism or civil unrest, including those resulting in travelers perceiving areas as unstable or an unwillingness of governments to grant visas, regional conflicts or an outbreak of hostilities or war could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel. Management cannot predict the extent to which disruptions from these types of events in air or other forms of travel would have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We are subject to extensive regulations that govern our operations in any jurisdiction where we operate. 
 We are required to obtain and maintain licenses from various jurisdictions in order to operate certain aspects of our business, and we are subject to extensive background investigations and suitability standards in our gaming business. We also will become subject to regulation in any other jurisdiction where we choose to operate in the future. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain new licenses or renew any of our existing licenses, or if such licenses are obtained, such licenses will not be conditioned, suspended or revoked; and the loss, denial or non-renewal of any of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1 Business Regulation and Licensing for further description of regulations that govern our operations.

Table of Contents 

 We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA ), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any violation of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate, including Singapore and Macao, as well as regulations set forth by the gaming authorities in the areas in which we operate. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations, or any accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money laundering activities, by any of our properties, employees or customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Certain local gaming laws apply to our gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions where we operate or plan to operate. 
 We are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning our current and proposed gaming activities and associations, including in Macao, Singapore and other jurisdictions. The gaming authorities in jurisdictions where we operate or plan to operate, including in Macao and Singapore, exercise authority for purposes of assessing suitability in relation to our activities in other gaming jurisdictions where we do business. Any gaming laws and regulations that apply to us could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted, and we may incur significant costs to comply, or may be unable to comply, with any new or modified gaming laws and regulations. 
 We depend primarily on our properties in two markets for all of our cash flow, and because we are a parent company our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from our subsidiaries. 
 We are primarily dependent upon our Asia properties for all of our cash. Given our operations are conducted primarily at properties in Macao and Singapore and a large portion of our planned development is in Macao and Singapore, we are subject to greater risk than if we were more diversified. 
 Additionally, because we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own, our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. We conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in our subsidiaries derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. Our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations, which may be impacted by the factors described above. For example, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we suspended our quarterly dividend program between April 2020 and July 2023, resuming dividend payments in August 2023, and SCL suspended its dividend payments beginning in February 2020. 
 In addition, our Macao and Singapore credit agreements, under certain circumstances, may limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us. We expect future debt instruments for the financing of future developments may contain similar restrictions. 
 Our debt instruments, current debt service obligations and substantial indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations. 
 Our current debt service obligations contain, or any future debt service obligations and instruments may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to: 
 incur additional debt, including providing guarantees or credit support; 
 incur liens securing indebtedness or other obligations; 
 dispose of certain assets; 
 make certain acquisitions; 
 pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments, such as purchasing equity interests, repurchasing junior indebtedness or making investments in third parties;

 enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 
 engage in any new businesses; 
 issue preferred stock; and 
 enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates. 
 In addition, our Macao, Singapore and U.S. credit agreements contain various financial covenants. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Long-Term Debt for further description of these covenants. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 14.03 billion of long-term debt outstanding, net of original issue discount and deferred offering costs (excluding those costs related to our revolving facilities). This indebtedness could have important consequences to us. For example, it could: 
 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service obligations; 
 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital needs, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or general corporate purposes; 
 require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available for our operations and development projects; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the industry in which we operate; 
 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and 
 subject us to higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates. 
 Subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our Singapore debt is secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of our Singapore operations. 
 Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the future will depend upon general economic and credit market conditions, potential approval required by local government regulators, adequate liquidity in the global credit markets, the particular circumstances of the gaming industry, and prevalent regulations and our cash flow and operations, in each case as evaluated at the time of such potential refinancing or replacement. We have a principal amount of 1.90 billion, 3.37 billion, 3.54 billion, 700 million and 1.90 billion in long-term debt maturing during the years ending December 31, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. If we are unable to refinance or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments, or not make dividend payments. There is no assurance any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements. 
 We may attempt to arrange additional financing to fund the remainder of our planned, and any future, development projects. If we are required to raise additional capital in the future, our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any debt financing would be further negatively impacted. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could require higher costs, include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. There is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. Our current debt service obligations contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, and our Macao, Singapore and U.S. credit agreements contain various financial covenants.

 We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 We record transactions in the functional currencies of our reporting entities. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period, which subjects us to foreign currency translation risks. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of our foreign operations could have an adverse effect on our U.S. dollar financial results. 
 We are a parent company whose primary source of cash is distributions from our subsidiaries. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/SGD exchange rate, the U.S. dollar/Macao pataca exchange rate and/or the U.S. dollar/Hong Kong Dollar HKD exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on the amount of dividends and distributions from our Singapore and Macao operations. 
 We extend credit to a portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players. 
 We conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than players who tend to wager lesser amounts. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 10.6 and 11.9 of our table games drop at our Macao properties and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, was from credit-based wagering. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. 
 While gaming debts are evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a marker, certain jurisdictions around the world, including jurisdictions our gaming customers may come from, may determine, or have determined, enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from courts in the U.S. and elsewhere are not binding in the courts of many foreign nations. 
 In particular, we expect our Macao operations will be able to enforce gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macao. To the extent our Macao gaming customers are from other jurisdictions, our Macao operations may not have access to a forum in which it will be possible to collect all gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and our Macao operations may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, our Macao operations remain obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers. 
 It is also possible our Singapore operations may not be able to collect gaming debts because, among other reasons, courts of certain jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts. To the extent our Singapore gaming customers' assets are situated in such jurisdictions, our Singapore operations may not be able to take enforcement action against such assets to facilitate collection of gaming receivables. 
 Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 Win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond our control, and the winnings of our gaming customers could exceed our casino winnings. 
 The gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. In addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played and the amount of time played. Our gaming profits are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming customers. Since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming customers. If the winnings of our gaming customers exceed our winnings, we may record a loss from our gaming operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 We face the risk of fraud and cheating. 
 Our gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our operations face significant competition, which may increase in the future. 
 The hotel, resort and casino businesses in Macao and Singapore are highly competitive. Our Macao properties compete with numerous other casinos located within Macao. Additional Macao facilities announced by our competitors and the increasing capacity of hotel rooms in Macao could add to the competitive dynamic of the market. 
 Our Macao and Singapore operations will also compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in Asia, including South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Australia, Cambodia and elsewhere in the world, including Las Vegas, as well as online gaming and cruise ships that offer gaming. Our operations also face increased competition from new developments in Malaysia, Australia and South Korea. In addition, certain countries have legalized, and others may in the future legalize, casino gaming, including Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. 
 The proliferation of gaming venues and gaming activities, such as online gaming, as well as renovations and expansions by our competitors, and their ability to attract customers away from our properties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures, including through acquisitions or strategic transactions, may not be successful. 
 We may opportunistically seek to expand our business through, among other things, expansion into new geographies or new ventures complementary to our current operations. These attempts to expand our business could increase the complexity of our business, require significant levels of investment and strain our management, personnel, operations and systems. In addition, our attempts to expand into new geographies could pose additional challenges given our limited operational experience in other jurisdictions. In order to facilitate such expansion, we may engage in strategic and complementary acquisitions and other transactions or investments involving other integrated resorts, hospitality or gaming brands, businesses, properties or other assets, either on our own or in partnership with others. These items are subject to challenges and risks that could affect our business, including: our incurrence of significant transaction costs in connection with a pending transaction or investment, regardless of whether it is completed; the restrictions on and obligations with respect to our business that may exist in connection with the pending transaction or investment; fluctuations in our market value, including the depreciation in our market value if the pending transaction or investment is not completed or the failure of the transaction or investment, even if completed, to increase our market value; and failure to integrate acquired businesses successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits or synergies of the transaction. As noted in Development Projects - New York, there is litigation associated with the Procedural Steps for our right to lease the underlying land of the Nassau County Coliseum from the County of Nassau in the State of New York. The Company is not a party to the litigation, but there can be no assurance as to the completion or positive outcome of the Procedural Steps or our ability to secure a new lease on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, there is no assurance we will be able to obtain a casino license from the State of New York. There can be no assurance that our business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investments, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our loan receivable is subject to certain risks, which could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 On February 23, 2022, in connection with closing of the sale of our Las Vegas real property and operations, including The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center (the Las Vegas Operations ), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 6.25 billion (the Las Vegas Sale ), we entered into a seller financing loan agreement, which provides for a six-year senior secured term loan with a principal amount of 1.19 billion as of December 31, 2023. While payments on the loan have been made, if this loan were to become impaired and could not be collected, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected for the amount of uncollected, or deemed uncollectible, principal and interest. 
 Risks Associated with Our International Operations 
 There are significant risks associated with our current and planned construction projects. 
 Our development projects and any other construction projects we undertake will entail significant risks. Construction activity requires us to obtain qualified contractors and subcontractors, the availability of which may be uncertain. Construction projects are subject to cost overruns and delays caused by events outside of our control or, in certain cases, our contractors' control, such as shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental and/or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases and unavailability of construction materials or equipment. Construction, equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite materials, licenses, permits, allocations and authorizations from governmental or regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay, jeopardize, prevent the construction or opening of our projects, or otherwise affect the design and features. As development and construction projects develop, we could also make decisions that result in increases to the expected costs and timelines for completion of our projects. Construction contractors or counterparties for our current projects may be required to bear certain cost overruns for which they are contractually liable, and if such counterparties are unable to meet their obligations, we may incur increased costs for such developments. For example, we are obligated to commence certain construction projects in Singapore under the Second Development Agreement by April 2024, which we do not expect to be able to timely commence. We are in discussions with the Singapore government on the duration of the timeline extension for commencement and completion of the expansion of Marina Bay Sands to fulfill our obligations under the Second Development Agreement. If such extension is not obtained, we will be in breach of our obligations under the Second Development Agreement. In addition, the number of ongoing projects and their locations throughout the world present unique challenges and risks to our management structure. If our management is unable to manage successfully our worldwide construction projects, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The anticipated costs and completion dates for our current and planned projects are based on budgets, designs, development and construction documents and schedule estimates are prepared with the assistance of architects and other construction development consultants and are subject to change as the design, development and construction documents are finalized and as actual construction work is performed. A failure to complete our projects on budget or on schedule may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our Macao Concession and Singapore development agreements and casino license can be terminated or redeemed under certain circumstances without compensation to us. 
 The Macao government has the right to unilaterally terminate our Concession in the event of VML's serious non-compliance with its basic obligations under the Concession and applicable Macao laws. Upon termination of our Concession, the casinos and gaming-related equipment, for which use has been temporarily transferred by the Macao government to VML, would automatically be transferred back to the Macao government without compensation to us and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. The loss of our Concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in Macao, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, beginning on January 1, 2029, the Macao government has the option to redeem the Concession by providing us at least one-year advance notice. In the event the Macao government exercises this redemption right, we are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. However, the compensation paid may not be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues.

 Under the casino regulatory framework in Singapore, our casino license may be terminated in the event of Marina Bay Sands' serious non-compliance with its obligations under the casino regulations or our casino license conditions, and the development agreements between Marina Bay Sands and the STB contain events of default that could permit the STB to terminate the agreement without compensation to us. If the development agreements are terminated, we could lose our right to operate the Marina Bay Sands and our investment in Marina Bay Sands could be lost. Additionally, under the terms of our development agreements with the STB, either or both the casino concession and the casino license may be terminated on public interest grounds, in which case, we are entitled to fair compensation. However, the compensation paid may not be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues. 
 The number of visitors to Macao, particularly visitors from mainland China, may decline or travel to Macao may be disrupted. 
 Our VIP and mass market gaming customers typically come from nearby destinations in Asia, including mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan. Increasingly, a significant number of gaming customers come to our casinos from mainland China. Slowdown in economic growth or changes of China's current restrictions on travel and currency movements have disrupted, and if such slowdown is continued and prolonged could further disrupt, the number of visitors from mainland China to our casinos in Macao as well as the amounts they are willing and able to spend while at our properties. 
 Policies and measures adopted from time to time by the Chinese government include restrictions imposed on exit visas granted to residents of mainland China for travel to Macao and Hong Kong. These polices and measures, if implemented, may have the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macao from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macao. 
 The Macao and Singapore governments could grant additional rights to conduct gaming in the future and increase competition we face. 
 We hold one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macao government to operate casino games of chance in Macao through December 31, 2032. We hold one of two licenses granted by the Singapore government to operate a casino in Singapore during an exclusive period expiring on December 31, 2030. If the Macao government were to allow additional gaming operators in Macao or the Singapore government were to license additional casinos, we would face additional competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Conducting business in Macao and Singapore has certain political and economic risks. 
 Our business development plans, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by significant political, social and economic developments in Macao and Singapore, and by changes in policies of the governments or changes in laws and regulations or their interpretations. Our operations in Macao and Singapore are also exposed to the risk of changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies based in those countries. Jurisdictional tax laws and regulations may also be subject to amendment or different interpretation and implementation, thereby having an adverse effect on our profitability after tax. These changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Current Macao and Singapore laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions and licenses are, for the most part, fairly recent and there is little precedent on the interpretation of these laws and regulations. We believe our organizational structure and operations are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations of Macao and Singapore. These laws and regulations are complex and a court or an administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue regulations, which differs from our interpretation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition, our activities in Macao and Singapore are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals, which may have a material adverse effect on our long-term business strategy and operations. Macao and Singapore laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.

 The Macao government approved smoking control legislation, which prohibits smoking in casinos other than in certain enumerated areas. Such legislation may deter potential gaming customers who are smokers from frequenting casinos in jurisdictions with smoking bans such as Macao. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future. We cannot predict the future likelihood or outcome of similar legislation or referendums in other jurisdictions where we operate or the magnitude of any decrease in revenues as a result of such regulations, though any smoking ban could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our tax arrangements with the Macao government may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. 
 We have had the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in Maca o, which exempts us from paying the 12 corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games, but does not apply to our non-gaming activities. We will continue to benefit from this tax exemption through December 31, 2027. Additionally, we entered into a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing an annual payment as a substitution for a 12 tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits (the Shareholder Dividend Tax Agreement ). We are in discussions for a new shareholder dividend tax agreement; however, there is no certainty this tax arrangement will be granted. 
 We are subject to limitations on the transfers of cash to and from our subsidiaries, limitations of the pataca exchange markets and restrictions on the export of the renminbi. 
 Our revenues in Macao are denominated in patacas, the legal currency of Macao, and Hong Kong dollars. The Macao pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and, in many cases, is used interchangeably with the Hong Kong dollar in Macao. Although currently permitted, we cannot assure you patacas will continue to be freely exchangeable into U.S. dollars. Also, our ability to convert large amounts of patacas into U.S. dollars over a relatively short period may be limited. 
 The ability of subsidiaries to make distributions to us depends on the earnings and cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL, compliance with certain local statutes, the laws and regulations currently and in the future applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements. While currently there is no foreign exchange or capital control restriction applicable to transactions between us and our Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China subsidiaries, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future. In addition, the mainland Chinese government also imposes controls on the convertibility of the renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China by our subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China. If, in the future, foreign exchange or capital control restrictions were to be imposed and become applicable to us, such restrictions could potentially reduce the amounts that we would be able to receive from our Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China subsidiaries. We do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should repatriated earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. 
 We are currently prohibited from accepting wagers in renminbi, the legal currency of China. There are also restrictions on the remittance of the renminbi from mainland China and the amount of renminbi that can be converted into foreign currencies, including the pataca and Hong Kong dollar. Restrictions on the remittance of the renminbi from mainland China may impede the flow of gaming customers from mainland China to Macao, inhibit the growth of gaming in Macao and negatively impact our gaming operations. There is no assurance that incremental mainland Chinese regulations will not be promulgated in the future that have the effect of restricting or eliminating the remittance of renminbi from mainland China. Further, if any new mainland Chinese regulations are promulgated in the future that have the effect of permitting or restricting (as the case may be) the remittance of renminbi from mainland China, then such remittances will need to be made subject to the specific requirements or restrictions set out in such rules. 
 If restrictions are placed on the ability of our subsidiaries in Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong and mainland China to make distributions or declare dividends or limitations of the pataca exchange markets and restrictions on the export of the renminbi are realized, it could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

 VML may have financial and other obligations to foreign workers seconded to its contractors under government labor quotas. 
 The Macao government has granted VML quotas to permit it to hire foreign workers. VML has effectively seconded part of the foreign workers employed under these quotas to its contractors for the construction of our Cotai Strip projects. VML, however, remains ultimately liable for all employer obligations relating to these workers, including for payment of wages and taxes and compliance with labor and workers' compensation laws. VML requires each contractor to whom it has seconded these foreign workers to indemnify VML for any costs or liabilities VML incurs as a result of such contractor's failure to fulfill their obligations. VML's agreements with its contractors also contain provisions that permit it to retain some payments for up to one year after the contractors' complete work on the projects. We cannot assure you VML's contractors will fulfill their obligations to workers hired under the labor quotas or to VML under the indemnification agreements, or the amount of any indemnification payments received will be sufficient to pay for any obligations VML may owe to foreign workers seconded to contractors under VML's quotas. Until we make final payments to our contractors, we have offset rights to collect amounts they may owe us, including amounts owed under the indemnities relating to employer obligations. After we have made the final payments, it may be more difficult for us to enforce any unpaid indemnity obligations. 
 Risks Related to Doing Business in China 
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or the value of our securities or our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors may be materially and adversely affected to the extent the laws and regulations of mainland China become applicable to our operations in Macao and Hong Kong or economic, political and legal developments in Macao adversely affect our Macao operations. 
 We are a parent company with limited business operations of our own, and our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. A significant portion of our business operations are based in Macao and held by various Macao-incorporated indirect subsidiaries of SCL, our majority-owned subsidiary incorporated in Cayman Islands and listed in Hong Kong (collectively referred to as the Macao Operations ). We also have subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China and Hong Kong that provide back-office support, such as information technology, accounting, hotel management and marketing services, which complement and support SCL s main back-office functions in Macao. 
 We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties relating to having a majority of our operations based in Macao and held by various Macao-incorporated indirect subsidiaries of SCL. Substantially all of SCL s assets are located in Macao and substantially all of SCL s revenue is derived from Macao. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial position and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal situation in Macao. China s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries, including the structure of the economy, level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of capital inflows and outflows, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. 
 Our operations face risks and uncertainties associated with evolving Chinese laws and regulations, such as those associated with the extent to which the level of Chinese government involvement, control of capital inflows and outflows, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources currently applicable within mainland China may become applicable to us and other risks and uncertainties as to whether and how recent Chinese government statements and regulatory developments, such as those relating to data and cyberspace security and anti-monopoly, could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless and affect our ability to list securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. If, in the future, there were to be a significant change in the manner in which the Chinese government exercises direct or indirect oversight, discretion or control over businesses operated in Macao, mainland China and Hong Kong, including the current interpretation and application of existing Chinese laws and regulations on how the Chinese government exercises direct or indirect oversight, discretion or control over businesses operated in Macao, mainland China and Hong Kong, it could potentially result in our Macao Operations being materially adversely affected and it could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, the Chinese government has recently adopted new rules to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers.

 There may be risks and uncertainties associated with the evolving laws and regulations in China, including their interpretation and implementation with respect to the enforcement of laws, rules and regulations and the possibility of changes thereto with little advance notice. If, in the future, there were to be any significant governmental influence in the future on, or in relation to our business or operations, or significant control over offerings of our securities or foreign investment in China-based issuers, this could potentially significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless and affect our ability to list securities on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. For example, on August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress SCNPC promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC PIPL ), which became effective on November 1, 2021. As the first systematic and comprehensive law specifically for the protection of personal information in the PRC, the PIPL provides extraterritorial effect on the personal information processing activities. Since our data processing activities outside mainland China from our Macao Operations relate to the offering of goods or services directed at natural persons in mainland China, our businesses from our Macao Operations operated outside mainland China are potentially subject to the requirements of PIPL. However, the implementation rules to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the PIPL have not been finalized yet, and it remains unclear how the Chinese government will enforce such law. If the extraterritorial jurisdiction under the PIPL were to be extended to us, our Macao Operations would be subject to certain data privacy obligations, which could potentially result in a material change to our operations. These data privacy obligations would primarily include bearing the responsibility for our personal information processing activities, and adopting the necessary measures to safeguard the security of the personal information we process in compliance with the standards required under the PIPL, the failure of which may result in us being ordered to correct or suspend or terminate the provision of services, confiscation of illegal income, fines or other penalties. Specifically, if the PIPL were to become applicable to us, we would be required to (i) notify the individuals concerned of the processing of their personal information in detail and establish legal bases for such processing; (ii) improve internal data governance by implementing managerial and technical security measures and response plans for security incidents; (iii) designate a person in charge of personal information protection where we qualify as a quantity processor (to be defined by the CAC); (iv) establish a special agency or designate a representative within the territory of the PRC to be responsible for handling matters relating to personal information protection; (v) establish and make public the procedure for individuals to exercise their rights related to personal information; (vi) conduct an impact assessment on personal information protection before any high-risk processing activities; (vii) conclude an agreement with such vendor and supervise its processing where we entrust processing of personal information to any vendor; (viii) meet one of the conditions prescribed by the PIPL where we transfer personal information outside the territory of the PRC due to business or other needs. In addition, under the PIPL, where an overseas organization or individual engages in personal information processing activities that infringe upon the personal information rights and interests of PRC citizens or endangering the national security and public interests of the PRC, the CAC may include such organization or individual in the list of subjects to whom provision of personal information is restricted or prohibited, announce the same, and take measures such as restricting or prohibiting provision of personal information to such organization or individual. Moreover, if the recent Chinese regulatory actions on data security or other data-related laws and regulations were to become applicable to us in the future, we could become subject to certain cybersecurity and data privacy obligations, which could potentially result in a material change to our operations, and the failure to meet such obligations could result in penalties and other regulatory actions against us and may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Recent events also indicate greater oversight by the CAC over data security, particularly for companies with Chinese operations seeking to list on a foreign exchange. For example, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review Review Measures issued by the CAC came into effect on February 15, 2022. The Review Measures provide that, in addition to critical information infrastructure operators CIIOs that intend to purchase network products or services, online platform operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security shall also be subject to cybersecurity review. The Review Measures require that an online platform operator which possesses the personal information of at least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review by the CAC if it intends to be listed in foreign countries. The Review Measures do not provide for a definition of online platform operator and, therefore, we cannot assure you that our Macao Operations will not be deemed as an online platform operator. However, as of the date of this report, our subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China do not have over one million users personal information and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million users personal information in the foreseeable future, and on that basis we believe we are not required to apply for 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 cybersecurity review by the CAC, even if we are deemed as an online platform operator. The Review Measures are not enacted in accordance with the PIPL, so our obligation to apply for cybersecurity review will not change no matter whether the PIPL applies to us or not. Further, we have not received any notice from any authorities identifying any of our subsidiaries as a CIIO or requiring them to undertake a cybersecurity review by the CAC. While we believe our subsidiaries are not required to apply for cybersecurity review, the Review Measures provide CAC and relevant authorities certain discretion to initiate cybersecurity review where any network product or service or any data handling activity is considered to affect or may affect national security, which may lead to uncertainties in relation to the Review Measures impact on our operations or the offering of our securities. 
 As advised by our PRC legal advisers, Haiwen Partners, SCL is currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the CSRC, CAC or any other mainland Chinese governmental authority to operate its business or to issue securities to foreign investors, other than those related to its two subsidiaries incorporated in mainland China that only provide back office support. SCL has received all requisite permissions and approvals for its back office supporting functions located in mainland China, primarily being the standard business licenses issued by the relevant authorities in mainland China, and it has never been denied such permissions and approvals. If SCL does not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals in relation to such back office support functions, we do not expect there will be any material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of our Macao Operations. However, in the event that we have inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required or if, in the future, applicable laws, regulations or interpretations were to change and require SCL to obtain such permissions or approvals, the failure to obtain such permissions or approvals could potentially result in penalties and other regulatory actions against SCL and may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, we face risks and uncertainties associated with evolving Chinese laws and regulations, such as those associated with the extent to which the level of Chinese government involvement, control of capital inflows and outflows, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources currently applicable within mainland China may become applicable to us. A significant portion of our assets are located in Macao and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from Macao. Accordingly, our results of operations, financial position and prospects are subject to a significant degree to the economic, political and legal situation in Macao. From December 20, 1999, Macao became a Special Administrative Region of China when China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao. The Basic Law of Macao provides that Macao will be governed under the principle of one country, two systems with its own separate government and legislature and that Macao will have a high degree of legislative, judicial and economic autonomy. However, there can be no assurance that economic, political and legal developments in Macao will not adversely affect our operations, or that there will not be a change in the manner in which regulatory oversight is conducted in Macao, if China were to apply such laws and regulations of mainland China to our operations in Macao and Hong Kong. If any such change were to occur, it could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and prospects. For example, currently in mainland China, the renminbi cannot be freely exchanged into any foreign currencies, and exchange and remittance of foreign currencies are subject to Chinese foreign exchange regulations. If, in the future, similar regulations were to become applicable to the exchange and remittance of patacas or other currencies in Macao, there could potentially be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our securities may be prohibited from being traded in the U.S. securities market and our investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspections or investigations if the PCAOB were not able to conduct full inspections or investigations of our auditor. 
 The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was enacted in December 2020 (as further amended, the HFCA Act ). The HFCA Act states that if the SEC determines that an issuer has filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years, the SEC shall prohibit the securities of the issuer from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 29, 2022, the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act was signed into law, which reduced the number of consecutive non-inspection years required for triggering the listing and trading prohibitions under the HFCA Act from three years to two years. 
 Under the HFCA Act, the SEC will identify a Commission-Identified Issuer if an issuer has filed an annual report containing an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that the PCAOB has determined it is 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction, and will then impose a trading prohibition on an issuer after it is identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years. If we were identified by the SEC as a Commission-Identified Issuer and have a non-inspection year, there is no assurance that we will be able to take remedial measures in a timely manner. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB reported that it was able, in 2022, to inspect and investigate completely audit firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and that, as a result, the PCAOB voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. However, uncertainties remain whether the PCAOB can continue to make a determination in the future that it is able to inspect and investigate completely PCAOB-registered audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong. 
 There could be additional regulatory or legislative requirements or guidance that could impact us if, in the future, our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. The SEC also may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. The implications of any additional regulation or guidance in addition to the requirements of the HFCA Act are uncertain, and such uncertainty could cause the market price of our securities to be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our auditor, Deloitte Touche LLP, is headquartered in the United States and was not identified as a firm that the PCAOB is unable to inspect, pursuant to the HFCA Act. However, there is no assurance that future audit reports will be prepared by auditors able to be inspected by the PCAOB. 
 If the PCAOB is unable to conduct inspections or full investigations of our auditor, our securities could be prohibited from being traded in the U.S. securities market, including over-the-counter, if, in the future, we were to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for two consecutive years. Such a prohibition could substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our securities when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential prohibition could have a negative impact on the price of our securities. Also, such a prohibition could significantly affect our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 Inspections of other audit firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside China have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. If the PCAOB were unable to conduct inspections or full investigations of our auditor, we and investors in our securities would be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. In addition, the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections or full investigations of auditors would make it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our independent registered public accounting firm s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors that are subject to the PCAOB inspections, which could cause investors and potential investors to lose confidence in the audit procedures and reported financial information and the quality of our financial statements. 
 Risks Related to Stock Ownership and Stockholder Matters 
 The interests of our principal stockholders in our business may be different from yours. 
 Dr. Adelson, her family members and trusts and other entities established for the benefit of Dr. Adelson s family members (collectively our Principal Stockholders beneficially owned approximately 51 of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, our Principal Stockholders exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs, including the composition of our Board of Directors and any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and the approval of a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. The concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of our Principal Stockholders. The interests of our Principal Stockholders may differ from your interests.

 Conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of SCL. 
 In November 2009, our subsidiary, SCL, listed its ordinary shares on The Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the SCL Offering ). We currently own 69.9 of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of SCL. As a result of SCL having stockholders who are not affiliated with us, we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of SCL may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of SCL. Decisions that could have different implications for us and SCL, including contractual arrangements we have entered into or may in the future enter into with SCL, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. 
 Human Capital Related Risk Factors 
 We depend on the continued services of key officers. 
 Our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the services of our senior management team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert G. Goldstein, and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Patrick Dumont. The loss of their services or the services of our other senior managers, or the inability to attract and retain additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We compete for limited management and labor resources in Macao and Singapore, and policies of those governments may also affect our ability to employ imported managers or labor. 
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and motivate skilled managers and employees at our properties. The Macao government requires we only hire Macao residents in our casinos for certain employee roles, including roles such as dealers. In addition, we are required in Macao to obtain visas and work permits for managers and employees we seek to employ from other countries. There is significant competition in Macao and Singapore for managers and employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer and competition for these individuals in Macao is likely to increase as other competitors expand their operations. 
 We may have to recruit managers and employees from other countries to adequately staff and manage our properties and certain Macao government policies affect our ability to hire non-resident managers and employees in certain job classifications. Despite our coordination with the Macao labor and immigration authorities to ensure our management and labor needs are satisfied, we may not be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified managers or employees for our operations or the Macao labor and immigration authorities may not grant us the necessary visas or work permits. 
 If we are unable to obtain, attract, retain and train skilled managers and employees, and obtain any required visas or work permits for our skilled managers and employees, our ability to adequately manage and staff our existing properties and planned development projects could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Labor actions and other labor problems could negatively impact our operations. 
 From time to time, we have experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees in the United States. Additionally, in the past, certain unions engaged in confrontational and obstructive tactics at some of our properties, including contacting potential customers, tenants and investors, objecting to various administrative approvals, social media campaigns and informational picketing, and these tactics may be utilized again by certain unions in the future. Although we believe we will be able to operate despite such tactics should they reoccur, no assurance can be given we will be able to do so or the failure to do so would not cause reputational damage and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although no assurances can be given, if employees decide to be represented by labor unions, management does not believe such representation would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot provide any assurance we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. The impact of any union activity is undetermined and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 General Risk Factors 
 Failure to maintain the integrity of our information and information systems or comply with applicable privacy and cybersecurity requirements and regulations could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. 
 Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of data and non-electronic information, including credit card numbers, dates of birth and other personal sensitive or financial information in various information systems we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract and may share data. We also maintain internal information about our employees and information relating to our operations. The integrity and protection of that information are important to us. Our collection of such information is subject to extensive private and governmental regulation. 
 Privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations are developing and changing frequently, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with the various applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations as they emerge and change. Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations also may adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties, and services to our guests and patrons. Non-compliance by us, or potentially by third parties with which we share information, with any applicable privacy and cybersecurity law or regulation, including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unauthorized access or dissemination, or breach of security may result in damage to our reputation and could subject us to fines, penalties, required corrective actions, lawsuits, payment of damages, or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. For example, in October 2023, our Marina Bay Sands property became aware of a data security incident involving third party unauthorized access to certain membership data relating to its loyalty program. The Personal Data Protection Commissioner of Singapore PDPC has commenced an investigation into the incident. We have cooperated with the PDPC in responding to its requests for information about the incident. Were the PDPC to make a finding of liability against us under Singapore s data protection law, it could assess a financial penalty against us, require us to undertake further remediation measures, or require us to make future assurances about our remedial measures. There can be no assurance that this incident will not result in additional governmental investigation, litigation, fines or other liability. 
 We have experienced a sophisticated criminal cybersecurity attack in the past and in the future may experience with more frequency global cybersecurity and information security threats, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. There has been an increase in criminal cybersecurity attacks against companies, including companies in our industry, where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and records, including those we maintain with third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber-attacks and information security breaches. Cyber-attacks and information security breaches may include attempts to access information, computer malware such as viruses, denial of service, ransomware attacks that encrypt, exfiltrate or otherwise render data unusable or unavailable in an effort to extort money or other consideration as a condition to purportedly returning the data to a usable form, operator errors or misuse, or inadvertent releases of data or documents, and other forms of electronic and non-electronic information security breaches. 
 Our data security measures are reviewed periodically and we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of customer and employee information. We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information, and manage our businesses. Our third-party information system service providers and other third parties that share data with us pursuant to contractual agreements also face risks relating to cybersecurity and privacy, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security or privacy operations. For example, the systems currently used for the transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not us. Our gaming operations rely heavily on technology services provided by third parties. In the event there is an interruption of these services to us, it may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, or those of third parties we engage to provide gaming operating systems for the facilities we operate, through cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations.

Table of Contents 

 A significant theft, destruction, loss or fraudulent use of information maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations and management team and result in remediation expenses (including liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage and offering incentives to customers or business partners to maintain their relationships after an attack) and regulatory fines, penalties and corrective actions, or lawsuits by regulators, third-party service providers, third parties that share data with us pursuant to contractual agreements or people whose data is or may be impacted. Such theft, destruction, loss or fraudulent use could also result in litigation by stockholders, governmental agencies, customers or other third parties. Advances in computer software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools, and other developments, including continuously evolving attack methods that may exploit vulnerabilities based on these advances, may increase the risk of a security breach or other intrusion. In addition, we may incur increased cybersecurity and privacy protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. We may not have sufficient financial resources available to us relating to cybersecurity in the event of a major cybersecurity event. Additionally, our cybersecurity insurance program may be inadequate to cover all of our losses resulting from a breach or other cyber incident. Cyber risk insurance availability and pricing can fluctuate substantially and we cannot be certain that our current level of insurance will be available in the future on economically reasonable terms. Any of these events could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation, fines and other liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks could be heightened for acquired businesses or operationally segmented early-stage subsidiaries that may have a comparatively less mature cybersecurity program. 
 We may fail to establish and protect our IP rights and could be subject to claims of IP infringement. 
 We endeavor to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property IP ), including our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, the steps we take to protect our IP will be sufficient. If a third party successfully challenges our trademarks, we could have difficulty maintaining exclusive rights. If a third party claims we have infringed, currently infringe or could in the future infringe upon its IP rights, we may need to cease use of such IP, defend our rights or take other steps. In addition, if third parties violate their obligations to us to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or there is a security breach or lapse, or if third parties misappropriate or infringe upon our IP, our business may be affected. Our inability to adequately obtain, maintain or defend our IP rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The licensing of our trademarks to third parties could result in reputational harm for us. 
 The conduct of the Las Vegas Operations under the Venetian and Palazzo brands and certain other trademarks licensed to the Las Vegas Operations pursuant to the agreements effecting the Las Vegas Sale could result in reputational harm to certain of the businesses we are retaining that will continue to operate under such brands if the Las Vegas Operations does not continue to operate in accordance with our high standards and applicable laws as required under such agreements. 
 Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer and our insurance costs may increase in the future. 
 We maintain comprehensive insurance programs for our properties in operation, as well as those in the course of construction, with coverage features and insured limits we believe are customary in their amount, breadth and scope. Market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a pandemic or catastrophic nature, such as infectious disease, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or cyber-related losses, or certain other liabilities including terrorist activity, political unrest, geopolitical strife or actual or threatened war may be, or are, uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for debt or other financial obligations related to the property.

Table of Contents 

 Certain of our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements. 
 We are subject to changes in tax laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to taxation and regulation by various government agencies, primarily in Macao, Singapore and the U.S. (federal, state and local levels). Like most U.S. companies, our effective income tax rate reflects the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the U.S. is taxed at local rates, which are often lower than U.S. tax rates. From time to time, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments make substantive changes to income tax, indirect tax and gaming tax rules and the application of these rules, which could result in higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretation. In particular, government agencies may make changes that could reduce the profits we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD and its inclusive Framework of over 140 countries have agreed to enact a two-pillar solution to reform international tax rules to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS project. Pillar One will reallocate taxing rights to market jurisdictions on residual profits of multinational enterprises MNEs with global turnover greater than 20 billion Euro EUR and a profit margin above 10 . Pillar Two consists of interrelated rules which operate to impose a minimum tax rate of 15 calculated on a jurisdictional basis on MNEs with a global turnover of at least EUR 750 million. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the OECD BEPS project as the OECD releases additional guidance and the individual countries in which we operate implement legislation. 
 If changes in tax laws and regulations were to significantly increase the tax rates on gaming revenues or income, these changes could increase our tax expense and liability, and therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation. 
 We have incurred and will continue to incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges into the air, water and land, the handling, diversion or disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Under these and other environmental requirements, we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our properties and may be held responsible to governmental entities or third parties, as an owner or operator, for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination. These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our properties. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations that limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, discourage the use of plastic materials or regulate recovery and/or disposal of certain waste streams and packaging materials due to environmental concerns may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations. 
 We are subject to risks from litigation, investigations, enforcement actions and other disputes. 
 Our business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents or gaming promoters could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances, it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. The investigations, litigation and other disputes may also lead to additional scrutiny from regulators, which could lead to investigations relating to, and possibly negatively impact, our gaming licenses and our ability to bid successfully for new gaming market opportunities. We cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future proceedings and the impact they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material. While some of these claims are covered by insurance, we cannot be certain that all of them will be, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 We could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance and sustainability matters. 
 Governments, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and growing, and new ESG laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting and diligence requirements. We have announced various ESG goals, commitments and initiatives, including with respect to climate change and other sustainability matters, our economic and social impact and human capital management. Our ability to achieve these goals is subject to numerous risks that may be outside of our control, and the criteria by which our ESG practices are assessed may change due to the evolution of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Our failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG goals or maintain ESG practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations and expanding legal requirements could harm our reputation, adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to attract and retain employees or customers and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. If we are unable to satisfy such new criteria, stakeholders may conclude our policies and/or actions with respect to ESG matters are inadequate and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

 ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY 
 We, together with our third-party vendors, employ information technology including networks, systems, and applications to support our business processes and decision-making across the Company. Our information technology is connected to support the flow of information across our business processes. As such, our information technology infrastructure is susceptible to cybersecurity threats. 
 We maintain detailed technology and cybersecurity programs to manage information security risk within the Company. We rely on both proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to protect and monitor the processing, transmission, and storage of company data and both customer and team member information. The objectives of our programs are to: 
 protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, 
 protect against anticipated threats, 
 protect against unauthorized access to our information technology systems, 
 safeguard assets, and 
 maintain resiliency and recovery plans regarding Company informational technology. 
 To meet these objectives and oversee the programs, we employ a Chief Information Security Officer CISO ). The CISO has over 27 years of cybersecurity experience, 25 years of cybersecurity leadership experience, an MBA in Information Systems, a Master of Science degree in operational analysis, a bachelor s degree in operations research and holds a Cyber Risk Oversight Certificate from the National Association of Corporate Directors and is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional CISSP ). The CISO works closely with the head of information technology and the data privacy officer to collectively manage our global cybersecurity, information technology and data privacy programs. 
 Our cybersecurity programs are informed by or aligned to the ISO/IEC 27001 security framework, an internationally recognized standard. As part of our programs, we assess our third-party vendors for relevant risks which may impact the Company. 
 We also engage third-party providers to perform periodic risk-based assessments of our cybersecurity programs, and also leverage our internal audit department, supported by third-party technical experts, to conduct periodic risk-based audits of our cybersecurity programs.

Table of Contents 

 Our Enterprise Risk Management ERM process, which is governed by an ERM Committee, includes a review of our cybersecurity programs. The ERM Committee, which is led by our executive vice president and chief financial officer, meets regularly, and receives updates from the CISO on emerging risks, recent cyber risk events, and any priority risks relating to cybersecurity. We also have a Cyber Privacy Steering CPS Committee, which meets regularly and is comprised of senior management, serving as a multi-disciplinary group for coordinating and overseeing the management of the cybersecurity and privacy programs. 
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for ERM, including the cybersecurity programs. The CISO provides regular updates on cyber security to the Audit Committee, including on the cybersecurity aspects noted by the ERM Committee and CPS Committee, and regularly meets with the Audit Committee in executive session. The presentations highlight the state of our cybersecurity and data security programs, as well as our progress on key initiatives in this area. 
 To date, the Company has not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. The Company, however, has experienced and expects to continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Failure to maintain the integrity of our information and information systems or comply with applicable privacy and cybersecurity requirements and regulations could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. for more detailed information on cybersecurity risks and the potential impacts. 
 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 We have received concessions from the Macao government to build on a six-acre land site for the Sands Macao and the sites on which The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao are located. We do not own these land sites in Macao; however, the land concessions grant us exclusive use of the land. Land concessions in Macao generally have an initial term of 25 years with automatic extensions of 10 years thereafter in accordance with Macao law. As specified in the land concessions, we are required to pay premiums, which are either payable in a single lump sum upon acceptance of our land concessions by the Macao government or in seven semi-annual installments, as well as annual rent for the term of the land concession, which may be revised every five years by the Macao government. In October 2008, the Macao government amended our land concession to separate the retail and hotel portions of The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao parcel and allowed us to subdivide the parcel into four separate components, consisting of retail; hotel/casino; an apart-hotel tower; and parking areas. In consideration for the amendment, we paid an additional land premium of approximately 18 million and will pay adjusted annual rent over the remaining term of the concession, which increased slightly due to the revised allocation of parcel use. With the expiry of VML s subconcession on December 31, 2022, all of our casinos, gaming areas and respective supporting areas located in the Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao, with a total area of approximately 136,000 square meters (representing approximately 4.7 of the total property area of these entities), reverted to and are now owned by the Macao government. Effective January 1, 2023, all these casinos and gaming areas, as well as respective supporting areas, have been temporarily transferred to us for the duration of the Concession in return for annual payments of 750 patacas per square meter for the first three years and 2,500 patacas per square meter for the following seven years (approximately 93 and 311, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). These compensation amounts will be adjusted annually based on the Macao average price index for the preceding year. 
 Under the Development Agreement with the STB, we paid SGD 1.20 billion (approximately 756 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) in premium payments for the 60-year lease of the land on which the Marina Bay Sands is located. In connection with the Second Development Agreement with the STB, we paid 963 million in premium payments for the lease of the parcels of land underlying the proposed MBS Expansion Project site, which will be effective until August 21, 2066.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Market Information 
 The Company's common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol LVS. As of January 31, 2024, there were 753,621,428 shares of our common stock outstanding that were held by 290 stockholders of record. 
 Preferred Stock 
 We are authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Nevada law and our articles of incorporation, to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock, including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued in one or more series, the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the shares. Our Board of Directors also is authorized to designate any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. 
 Dividends 
 Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock is subject to the requirements of Nevada law. In addition, we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own. Accordingly, our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. 
 Our subsidiaries' long-term debt arrangements place restrictions on their ability to pay cash dividends to the Company. This may restrict our ability to pay cash dividends other than from cash on hand. See Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Restrictions on Distributions and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Long-Term Debt. 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 In April 2020, we suspended our quarterly dividend program due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and in August 2023, the dividend program was reinstated. 
 In January 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per common share (a total estimated to be approximately 151 million) to be paid on February 14, 2024, to stockholders of record on February 6, 2024. We expect this level of dividend to continue quarterly through the remainder of 2024. Our Board of Directors will continue to assess the level of appropriateness of any cash dividends.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K. Certain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We view each of our Integrated Resorts as an operating segment. Our operating segments in Macao consist of The Venetian Macao; The Londoner Macao; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao; and the Sands Macao. Our operating segment in Singapore is Marina Bay Sands. 
 During 2023, we achieved milestones in advancing several of our strategic objectives. We acquired the Nassau Coliseum, which included the right to lease the underlying land, with the intent to obtain a casino license from the State of New York to develop and operate an Integrated Resort. There is no assurance we will be able to obtain such casino license. We commenced work on Phase II of The Londoner Macao, which includes the renovation of the rooms in the Sheraton and Conrad hotel towers, an upgrade of the gaming areas and the addition of new attractions, dining, retail and entertainment offerings. We are nearing completion of renovations in Tower 1 and Tower 2 to provide world-class suites and other luxury amenities at Marina Bay Sands and announced the next phase with the renovation of the Tower 3 hotel rooms into world class suites and other property changes. We welcomed the return to normal operating conditions at our Macao operations with the relaxation of various COVID-19 restrictions beginning in late December 2022. 
 Macao 
 From 2020 through the beginning of 2023, our operations in Macao were negatively impacted by the reduction in travel and tourism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Macao government's policy regarding the management of COVID-19 and general travel restrictions was relaxed in late December 2022 and early January 2023. Since then, visitation to our Macao Integrated Resorts and operations has improved. 
 The Macao government announced total visitation from mainland China to Macao increased approximately 273.1 and decreased approximately 31.8 , during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022 and 2019 (pre-pandemic), respectively. The Macao government also announced gross gaming revenue increased approximately 333.8 and decreased approximately 37.4 , during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022 and 2019, respectively. 
 Singapore 
 From 2020 through early 2022, our operations in Singapore were negatively impacted by the reduction in travel and tourism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Vaccinated Travel Framework VTF ), launched in April 2022, facilitated the resumption of travel and had a positive impact on operations at Marina Bay Sands. During February 2023, all remaining COVID-19 border measures were lifted. Airlift passenger movement has increased with a total of 59 million passengers having passed through Singapore's Changi Airport from January through December 2023, an increase of 83 and a decrease of 14 compared to 2022 and 2019, respectively. 
 Visitation to Marina Bay Sands continues to improve since the travel restrictions have been lifted. The STB announced total visitation to Singapore increased from approximately 6.3 million in 2022 to 13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, while visitation decreased 28.8 when compared to the same period in 2019. 
 Summary 
 We have a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity in place, including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 5.11 billion and access to 1.50 billion, 2.49 billion and 446 million of available borrowing capacity from our LVSC Revolving Facility, 2018 SCL Revolving Facility and the 2012 Singapore Revolving Facility, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. We believe we are able to support continuing operations and complete the major construction projects that are underway.

 Key Operating Revenue Measurements 
 Operating revenues at The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao and Marina Bay Sands are dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel, which affects the price charged for hotel rooms and our gaming volume. Operating revenues at Sands Macao are principally driven by casino customers who visit the property on a daily basis. 
 Management utilizes the following volume and pricing measures in order to evaluate past performance and assist in forecasting future revenues. The various volume measurements indicate our ability to attract customers to our Integrated Resorts. In casino operations, win and hold percentages indicate the amount of revenue to be expected based on volume. In hotel operations, average daily rate and revenue per available room indicate the demand for rooms and our ability to capture that demand. In mall operations, base rent per square foot indicates our ability to attract and maintain profitable tenants for our leasable space. 
 The following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenues: 
 Casino revenue measurements for Macao and Singapore: Macao and Singapore table games are segregated into two groups: Rolling Chip play (composed of VIP players) and Non-Rolling Chip play (mostly non-VIP players). The volume measurement for Rolling Chip play is non-negotiable gaming chips wagered and lost. The volume measurement for Non-Rolling Chip play is table games drop drop ), which is net markers issued (credit instruments), cash deposited in the table drop boxes and gaming chips purchased and exchanged at the cage. Rolling Chip and Non-Rolling Chip volume measurements are not comparable as they are two distinct measures of volume. The amounts wagered and lost for Rolling Chip play are substantially higher than the amounts dropped for Non-Rolling Chip play. Slot handle, also a volume measurement, is the gross amount wagered for the period cited. 
 We view Rolling Chip win as a percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip win as a percentage of drop and slot hold (amount won by the casino) as a percentage of slot handle. Win or hold percentage represents the percentage of Rolling Chip volume, Non-Rolling Chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue. Our win and hold percentages are calculated before discounts, commissions, deferring revenue associated with our loyalty programs and allocating casino revenues related to goods and services provided to patrons on a complimentary basis. Our Rolling Chip win percentage is expected to be 3.30 in Macao and Singapore. Actual win percentage may vary from our expected win percentage and historical win and hold percentages. Generally, slot machine play is conducted on a cash basis. In Macao and Singapore, 10.6 and 11.9 , respectively, of our table games play was conducted on a credit basis for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Hotel revenue measurements: Performance indicators used are occupancy rate (a volume indicator), which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, and average daily room rate ADR, a price indicator), which is the average price of occupied rooms per day. Available rooms exclude those rooms unavailable for occupancy during the period due to renovation, development or other requirements (such as government mandated closure, lodging for team members and usage by the Macao government for quarantine measures). The calculations of the occupancy rate and ADR include the impact of rooms provided on a complimentary basis. Revenue per available room RevPAR represents a summary of hotel ADR and occupancy. Because not all available rooms are occupied, ADR is normally higher than RevPAR. Reserved rooms where the guests do not show up for their stay and lose their deposit, or where guests check out early, may be re-sold to walk-in guests. 
 Mall revenue measurements: Occupancy, base rent per square foot and tenant sales per square foot are used as performance indicators. Occupancy represents gross leasable occupied area GLOA divided by gross leasable area GLA at the end of the reporting period. GLOA is the sum of: (1) tenant occupied space under lease and (2) tenants no longer occupying space, but paying rent. GLA does not include space currently under development or not on the market for lease. Base rent per square foot is the weighted average base or minimum rent charge, excluding rent concessions, in effect at the end of the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in occupancy. Tenant sales per square foot is the sum of reported comparable sales for the trailing 12 months divided by the comparable square footage for the same period. Only tenants that have been open for a minimum of 12 months are included in the tenant sales per square foot calculation.

 Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022 
 Summary Financial Results 
 We continued to see positive financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the lift of COVID-19 restrictions in Macao beginning in late December 2022 and the elimination of most pandemic-related restrictions in Singapore in April 2022. Macao visitation from mainland China increased 273.1 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to relaxed general travel restrictions. Singapore visitation increased 115.8 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to the elimination of all remaining pandemic restrictions in February 2023 and an 83 increase in airlift passenger movement compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were 10.37 billion, compared to 4.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Operating income was 2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to an operating loss of 792 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net income from continuing operations was 1.43 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of 1.54 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Operating Revenues 
 Our net revenues consisted of the following: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Percent Change (Dollars in millions) Casino 7,522 2,627 186.3 Rooms 1,204 469 156.7 Food and beverage 584 301 94.0 Mall 767 580 32.2 Convention, retail and other 295 133 121.8 Total net revenues 10,372 4,110 152.4 
 Consolidated net revenues were 10.37 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 6.26 billion compared to 4.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by an increase of 4.93 billion at our Macao operations. The increase at our Macao operations was due to increased visitation as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in Macao and the surrounding region in late December 2022 and early January 2023. In addition, an increase of 1.33 billion at Marina Bay Sands was primarily due to increased visitation from the reopening of borders and elimination of all remaining pandemic-related restrictions in February 2023 and an increase in airlift passenger movement in 2023. 
 Net casino revenues increased 4.90 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by a 3.89 billion increase at our Macao operations due to increased visitation across our properties resulting in increased table games and slot volumes, partially offset by a decrease in table games win percentages. Casino revenues at Marina Bay Sands increased by 1.0 billion due to increased table games and slot volumes, partially offset by a decrease in slot hold percentage. The lift of COVID-19 restrictions in Macao beginning in late December 2022 and elimination of restrictions in Singapore in February 2023 and an increase in airlift passenger movement in 2023 led to increased visitation and table games and slot volumes.

 In our experience, average win percentages remain fairly consistent when measured over extended periods of time with a significant volume of wagers, but can vary considerably within shorter time periods as a result of the statistical variances associated with games of chance in which large amounts are wagered. 
 Room revenues increased 735 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to increases of 577 million and 158 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Macao room revenue increased as a result of increased occupancy rates and ADR, driven by increased visitation as pandemic-related restrictions were lifted beginning in December 2022, and the grand opening of The Londoner Macao in May 2023. Marina Bay Sands room revenues increased as a result of increased occupancy rates and ADR due to the elimination of all remaining pandemic-related restrictions in February 2023 and increased airlift passenger movement in Singapore in 2023. Our room revenues were also impacted by the disruption of the renovation associated with the introduction of new and elevated suites and rooms and other amenities throughout 2023. 
 The following table summarizes the results of our room activity : Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change (Room revenues in millions) Macao Operations: The Venetian Macao Total room revenues 191 55 247.3 Occupancy rate 94.5 41.7 52.8 pts Average daily room rate (ADR) 208 143 45.5 Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 196 60 226.7 The Londoner Macao Total room revenues 324 61 431.1 Occupancy rate 80.4 26.9 53.5 pts Average daily room rate (ADR) 196 155 26.5 Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 158 42 276.2 The Parisian Macao Total room revenues 135 33 309.1 Occupancy rate 93.0 37.9 55.1 pts Average daily room rate (ADR) 158 110 43.6 Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 147 42 250.0 The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao Total room revenues 94 29 224.1 Occupancy rate 81.5 27.5 54.0 pts Average daily room rate (ADR) 485 440 10.2 Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 396 121 227.3

Of the 2,100 available rooms for the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 1,250 rooms have been renovated. The completion of the remaining rooms is projected for early 2025 and will ultimately result in 1,850 available rooms. 
 Food and beverage revenues increased 283 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to a 173 million and 110 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, driven by new outlets and increased business volume at existing food and beverage outlets and banquet operations. 
 Mall revenues increased 187 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to a 159 million increase at our Macao operations, primarily driven by an increase in overage rent and a decrease in rent concessions granted to our mall tenants, and a 28 million increase at Marina Bay Sands, driven by increases in minimum rent and overage rent.

 Convention, retail, and other revenues increased 162 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to increases of 127 million and 35 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. Increases at our Macao operations were primarily driven by increases of 57 million in ferry operations due to the resumption of ferry services in January 2023, 31 million in entertainment revenue, 16 million in limo revenue, 5 million in retail revenue, 4 million in convention revenue and 14 million in other 
 53 

Table of Contents 

 operating revenues (e.g., Eiffel Tower, spa, and gondola rides). Increases at Marina Bay Sands were primarily driven by increases of 18 million in convention revenue, 2 million in entertainment revenue and 15 million in other operating revenues (e.g. SkyPark, art/science museum). 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consisted of the following: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Percent Change (Dollars in millions) Casino 4,152 1,792 131.7 Rooms 283 173 63.6 Food and beverage 481 319 50.8 Mall 88 73 20.5 Convention, retail and other 201 103 95.1 Provision for credit losses 4 15 (73.3) General and administrative 1,107 936 18.3 Corporate 230 235 (2.1) Pre-opening 15 13 15.4 Development 205 143 43.4 Depreciation and amortization 1,208 1,036 16.6 Amortization of leasehold interests in land 58 55 5.5 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets 27 9 200.0 Total operating expenses 8,059 4,902 64.4 
 Operating expenses were 8.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 3.16 billion compared to 4.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a 2.36 billion increase in casino expenses. 
 Casino expenses increased 2.36 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of 1.90 billion and 232 million in gaming taxes at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, consistent with increased casino revenues. In addition, we had increases in gaming tax rates of 1 in Macao and 3 in Singapore, and a 1 increase in value added tax in Singapore. 
 Room expenses increased 110 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to increases of 83 million and 27 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, consistent with increased occupancy at both our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands. Additionally, the increase was also due to higher costs associated with the renovated and expanded suites and rooms at The Londoner Macao and the new and elevated suites and rooms introduced at Marina Bay Sands during the year. 
 Food and beverage expenses increased 162 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to increases of 85 million and 77 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively, driven by increased business volume at food outlets and banquets and consistent with increased property visitation. 
 Convention, retail and other expenses increased 98 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by increases of 82 million and 16 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. The increases were primarily due to increases of 36 million in ferry operation expenses due to the resumption of ferry services in January 2023, 29 million in entertainment expenses due to increased number of events held in 2023, 15 million in limo expenses, 7 million in convention expenses, 3 million in retail expenses and 8 million in other operating expenses (e.g., spa and valet). 
 The provision for credit losses was 4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 15 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The 11 million decrease was primarily driven by decreases of 8 million and 3 million at our Macao operations and Marina Bay Sands, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 by collections of receivables that were fully reserved. The amount of this provision can vary over short periods of time because of factors specific to the patrons who owe us money from gaming activities. We believe the amount of our provision for credit losses in the future will depend upon the state of the economy, our credit standards, our risk assessments and the judgment of our employees responsible for granting credit. 
 General and administrative expenses increased 171 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by increases of 95 million and 76 million at Marina Bay Sands and our Macao operations, respectively, driven by increases in payroll and marketing costs, utilities and property taxes. 
 Pre-opening expenses represent personnel and other costs incurred prior to the opening of new ventures, which are expensed as incurred. The majority of pre-opening expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the grand opening of The Londoner Macao and new guest rooms at Marina Bay Sands. Pre-opening expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 related to Marina Bay Sands. 
 Development expenses were 205 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 143 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the costs were associated with our evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, primarily 93 million in New York and Texas, and 109 million for our digital gaming related efforts. Development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 172 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to 109 million increase at Marina Bay Sands, as a result of the completion of renovations that were placed into service and a 60 million increase at our Macao operations, primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation related to the second phase of the renovations at The Londoner Macao and amortization of the intangible asset related to the Macao gaming concession. 
 Loss on disposal or impairment of assets was 27 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The losses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2023, were primarily due to 13 million in demolition costs related to renovations at Marina Bay Sands and 12 million in disposals and demolition costs at our Macao operations. The losses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to 4 million in asset disposals related to aircraft parts and 3 million in asset disposal and demolition costs, primarily at The Londoner Macao, The Venetian Macao, Sands Macao and our corporate offices.

 continuing operations before stock-based compensation expense, corporate expense, pre-opening expense, development expense, depreciation and amortization, amortization of leasehold interests in land, gain or loss on disposal or impairment of assets, interest, other income or expense, gain or loss on modification or early retirement of debt and income taxes. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management, as well as industry analysts, to evaluate operations and operating performance. In particular, management utilizes consolidated adjusted property EBITDA to compare the operating profitability of our operations with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. Integrated Resort companies have historically reported adjusted property EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure to GAAP financial measures. In order to view the operations of their properties on a more stand-alone basis, Integrated Resort companies, including Las Vegas Sands Corp., have historically excluded certain expenses that do not relate to the management of specific properties, such as pre-opening expense, development expense and corporate expense, from their adjusted property EBITDA calculations. Consolidated adjusted property EBITDA should not be interpreted as an alternative to income from operations (as an indicator of operating performance) or to cash flows from operations (as a measure of liquidity), in each case, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cash flow, including capital expenditures, dividend payments, interest payments, debt principal repayments and income taxes, which are not reflected in consolidated adjusted property EBITDA. Not all companies calculate adjusted property EBITDA in the same manner. As a result, our presentation of consolidated adjusted property EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

 a) During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of 72 million and 70 million, respectively, of which 43 million and 37 million, respectively, was included in corporate expense in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Consolidated Statements of Operations . 
 Adjusted property EBITDA at our Macao operations increased 2.55 billion compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased casino and room revenues, driven by increased visitation at our properties due to the lift of COVID-19 restrictions in late December 2022 and early January 2023. 
 Adjusted property EBITDA at Marina Bay Sands increased 805 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues across our operations driven by the opening of borders and elimination of all remaining pandemic-related restrictions in February 2023 and increased airlift passenger movement in Singapore in 2023, as well as introducing new and elevated suites and rooms and other amenities at Marina Bay Sands during 2023.

 Interest Expense 
 The following table summarizes information related to interest expense: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Dollars in millions) Interest cost 
 825 706 Less capitalized interest (7) (4) Interest expense, net 
 818 702 Cash paid for interest 
 753 618 Weighted average total debt balance 
 15,188 15,298 Weighted average interest rate 
 5.2 4.6 
 Interest cost increased 119 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting primarily from increases in our weighted average interest rate, partially offset by decreases in our weighted average total debt balance. The weighted average interest rate increased primarily due to the increase in the underlying benchmark rates on our SCL Revolving Facility and our Singapore Credit Facility, and increased interest rates on the SCL senior notes in connection with the credit rating downgrades in February and June 2022, partially offset by the credit rating upgrade in July 2023 (see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Long-Term Debt ). The weighted average debt balance decreased primarily due to payments made on the SCL revolver totaling 1.95 billion throughout the year ended December 31, 2023. We also had 31 million in imputed interest expense on the VML Concession financial liability in 2023 (see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net ). 
 Other Factors Affecting Earnings 
 Interest income was 288 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 116 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to 258 million in interest income on money market funds, bank deposits and treasury bills driven by higher interest rates. Our average interest rates on cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 4.8 compared to 1.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022. We also had 29 million in interest income on the seller financing loan in connection with the sale of the Las Vegas Operating Properties, which increased 8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to an increase in the interest rate as the buyer elected payment-in-kind for the interest payments effective July 1, 2022 and an increase in the period in which the loan balance was outstanding in 2023. 
 Other expense was 8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to foreign currency transaction losses driven by the U.S. dollar-denominated debt held by SCL, partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains driven by U.S dollar-denominated intercompany debt held by MBS. 
 Our income tax expense was 344 million on income before income taxes of 1.78 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a 19.4 effective income tax rate. This compares to an 11.1 effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflects a 17 statutory tax rate on our Singapore operations and a 21 corporate income tax rate on our U.S. operations. 
 Our operations in Macao are subject to a 12 statutory income tax rate, but in connection with the 35 gaming tax, VML and its peers received an income tax exemption on gaming operations through December 31, 2022. On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that VML and its peers would continue to receive this exemption for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. Additionally, we entered into a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing an annual payment as a substitution for a 12 tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits. We are in discussions for a new shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government, which would commence effective as of January 1, 2023.

 The net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests from continuing operations was 210 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of 475 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These amounts were related to the noncontrolling interest of SCL. 
 Additional Information Regarding our Retail Mall Operations 
 The following tables summarize the results of our mall operations on the Cotai Strip and at Marina Bay Sands for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:

 Note: This table excludes the results of our mall operations at Sands Macao. 
 (1) Minimum rents include base rents and straight-line adjustments of base rents. 
 (2) Commercial property that generates rental income is exempt from property tax for the first six years for newly constructed buildings in Cotai. If the property also qualifies for Tourism Utility Status, the property tax exemption can be extended to twelve years with effect from the opening of the property. To date, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao have obtained an extended exemption. The exemption for The Venetian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao expired in August 2019 and August 2020, respectively, and the exemption for The Londoner Macao and The Parisian Macao will be expiring in December 2027 and September 2028, respectively. 
 (3) Mall-related expenses consist of CAM, marketing fees and other direct operating expenses, property taxes and provision for credit losses, but excludes depreciation and amortization and general and administrative costs. 
 (4) Rent concessions were provided to tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on mall operations.

Table of Contents 

 It is common in the mall operating industry for companies to disclose mall net operating income NOI as a useful supplemental measure of a mall's operating performance. Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, interest expense, impairment losses, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, allocations to noncontrolling interests and provision for income taxes, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. 
 In the table above, we believe taking total mall revenues less mall-related expenses provides an operating performance measure for our malls. Other mall operating companies may use different methodologies for deriving mall-related expenses. As such, this calculation may not be comparable to the NOI of other mall operating companies.

 Cash Flows Operating Activities 
 Table games play at our properties is conducted on a cash and credit basis, while slot machine play is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Our rooms, food and beverage and other non-gaming revenues are conducted primarily on a cash basis and to a lesser extent as a trade receivable. Operating cash flows are generally affected by changes in operating income, accounts receivable, gaming related liabilities and interest payments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash generated from operations was 3.23 billion, an increase of 4.17 billion compared to cash used in operating activities of 944 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash generated from operations was primarily due to our Macao and Singapore operations generating increased operating income driven by the acceleration of visitation and the elimination of all remaining pandemic-related restrictions in Singapore in February 2023, and in Macao in late December 2022 and early January 2023. We also had increases in cash related to changes in working capital due to our gaming operations. 
 Cash Flows Investing Activities 
 Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023, totaled 1.02 billion. Included in this amount was 584 million at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, primarily due to Towers 1 and 2 room renovations. Capital expenditures were 233 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted of 132 million for The Londoner Macao, 71 million for The Venetian Macao, 15 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, 9 million for The Parisian Macao and 6 million for Sands Macao. Additionally, we funded 200 million for corporate and other. 
 Included in net cash flows from investing activities was a payment of 221 million related to the purchase of the Nassau Coliseum. 
 Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled 651 million . Included in this amount was 348 million at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, primarily due to Towers 1 and 2 room renovations. Capital expenditures were 243 million for construction and development activities in Macao, which consisted of 175 million for The Londoner Macao, 52 million for The Venetian Macao, 9 million for The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Macao, 4 million for Sands Macao and 3 million for The Parisian Macao. Additionally, we funded 60 million for corporate and other. 
 Cash Flows Financing Activities 
 Net cash flows utilized for financing activities were 3.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were 2.07 billion in repayments on long-term debt, primarily related to the repayment on the SCL revolving facility of 1.95 billion. We also utilized 505 million for common stock repurchases and 305 million for dividend payments related to our stockholder return of capital program, and funded 250 million for a forward contract to purchase common stock of SCL to increase our equity ownership in SCL. Lastly, we paid 32 million in deferred offering costs, primarily related to the amendment and restatement of the 2018 SCL Credit Facility, and 29 million in other financial liability payments. 
 Net cash flows generated from financing activities were 6.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of the Las Vegas Operating Properties of 4.89 billion and 1.20 billion from the drawdown of our SCL revolving facility. These items were partially offset by 66 million in repayments on long-term debt and 11 million in deferred offering costs relating to obtaining LVSC Revolving Facility lender consents to consummate the Las Vegas Sale and the covenant waiver obtained on the 2018 SCL Credit Facility. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had 4.44 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore revolving facilities, net of letters of credit. Additionally, we had 2.79 billion available for borrowing under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility to finance construction costs incurred in connection with the MBS Expansion Project. 
 Capital Financing Overview 
 We fund our development projects primarily through borrowings from our debt instruments (see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12 Long-Term Debt and operating cash flows.

 Our U.S., SCL and Singapore credit facilities, as amended, contain various financial covenants, which include maintaining a maximum leverage ratio, as defined per the respective facility agreements. As of December 31, 2023, our U.S. and Singapore leverage ratios, as defined per the respective credit facility agreements, were 3.3x and 1.7x, respectively, compared to the maximum leverage ratios allowed of 4.0x and 4.5x, respectively, while our SCL credit facility had a covenant waiver through January 1, 2024, as mentioned below. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under these credit facilities, we would be in default under the respective credit facilities. 
 On May 11, 2023, SCL entered into an amended and restated facility agreement (the A R Facility Agreement with respect to certain provisions of the 2018 SCL Credit Facility, pursuant to which lenders have (a) extended the termination date for the Hong Kong Dollar HKD commitments and U.S. dollar commitments of the lenders that consented to the waivers and amendments in the A R Facility Agreement (the Extending Lenders from July 31, 2023 to July 31, 2025; (b) extended to (and including) January 1, 2024, the waiver period for the requirement for SCL to comply with the requirements that SCL ensure (i) the consolidated leverage ratio does not exceed 4.0x and (ii) the consolidated interest coverage ratio is not less than 2.5x; (c) amended the definition of consolidated total debt such that it excludes any financial indebtedness that is subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the A R Facility Agreement (including the 1.0 billion subordinated unsecured term loan facility made available by the Company to SCL); (d) amended the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio as of the last day of each of the financial quarters ending March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024, December 31, 2024, and subsequent financial quarters to be 6.25x, 5.5x, 5.0x, 4.5x, and 4.0x respectively; and (e) extended to (and including) January 1, 2025 the period during which SCL s ability to declare or make any dividend payment or similar distribution is restricted if at such time (x) the Total Commitments (as defined in the A R Facility Agreement) exceed 2.0 billion by SCL s exercise of the option to increase the Total Commitments by an aggregate amount of up to 1.0 billion and (y) the consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 4.0x, unless, after giving effect to such payment, the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents of SCL on such date and (ii) the aggregate amount of the undrawn facility under the A R Facility Agreement and unused commitments under other credit facilities of SCL is greater than 2.0 billion. Pursuant to the A R Facility Agreement, SCL paid a customary fee to the Extending Lenders that consented. The amendments with respect to the extended commitments took effect on July 31, 2023. 
 We held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 5.11 billion and restricted cash of 124 million as of December 31, 2023, of which approximately 2.20 billion of the unrestricted amount is held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the 2.20 billion, approximately 1.80 billion is available to be repatriated, either in the form of dividends or via intercompany loans or advances, to the U.S., subject to levels of earnings, cash flow generated from gaming operations and various other factors, including dividend requirements to third-party public stockholders in the case of funds being repatriated from SCL, compliance with certain local statutes, laws and regulations currently applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements. We do not expect withholding taxes or other foreign income taxes to apply should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise. 
 We believe the cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations, as well as the 4.44 billion available for borrowing under our U.S., Macao and Singapore credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, and SGD 3.69 billion (approximately 2.79 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) under the 2012 Singapore Delayed Draw Term Facility, as of December 31, 2023 (only available for draws after the construction cost estimate and construction schedule for the MBS Expansion Project have been delivered to the lenders), will be sufficient to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facilities and fund our working capital needs, committed and planned capital expenditures, development opportunities, debt obligations and dividend commitments, as well as meet our commitments under the Macao Concession. In the normal course of our activities, we will continue to evaluate global capital markets to consider future opportunities for enhancements of our capital structure. 
 In July 2023, we announced the resumption of our return of capital program. On August 16, 2023 and November 15, 2023, we paid a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per common share as part of a regular cash dividend program and, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded 305 million as a distribution against retained earnings. In January 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.20 per common share (a total estimated to be approximately 151 million) to be paid on February 14, 2024, to stockholders of record on 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 February 6, 2024. We expect this level of dividend to continue quarterly through the remainder of 2024. Our Board of Directors will continue to assess the level of appropriateness of any cash dividends. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On October 16, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized increasing the remaining share repurchase amount under our existing share repurchase program of 916 million to 2.0 billion and extending the expiration date from November 2024 to November 3, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 11,121,497 shares of our common stock for 510 million (including commissions and 5 million in excise tax) under our current program. All share repurchases of our common stock have been recorded as treasury stock. 
 We have approximately 1.50 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. Repurchases of our common stock are made at our discretion in accordance with applicable federal securities laws in the open market or otherwise. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our financial position, earnings, cash flows, legal requirements, other investment opportunities and market conditions.

 (1) As of December 31, 2023, we had a 105 million liability related to uncertain tax positions. We do not expect this liability to result in a payment of cash within the next 12 months. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions; therefore, such amounts are not included in the table.

 (4) Based on the 1-month rate as of December 31, 2023, Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR of 5.40 , Hong Kong Inter-Bank Offer Rate HIBOR of 5.27 and Singapore Swap Offer Rate SOR of 3.62 , plus the applicable interest rate spread in accordance with the respective debt agreements. 
 (5) In addition to the amounts listed in the table above, under the Macao Concession, we have committed to spend 30.24 billion patacas (approximately 3.76 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) through 2032 on both capital and operating projects, including 27.80 billion patacas (approximately 3.45 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in non-gaming projects. As Macao's annual gross gaming revenue amounted to 183.06 billion patacas (approximately 22.74 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in 2023, we are required to invest, or cause to be invested, an additional 5.56 billion patacas (approximately 691 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) in non-gaming investment projects by December 2032. As the exact timing of this spend has not been finalized, these amounts have not been included in the table above. 
 We are also required to pay a 35 gross gaming revenue special gaming tax and a 5 gross gaming revenue contribution in Macao, which amounts we pay are variable in nature. Under the Concession, however, we are obligated to pay a special annual gaming premium if the average of the gross gaming revenues of our gaming tables and our electrical or mechanical gaming machines, including slot machines, is lower than a certain minimum amount determined by the Macao government; such special premium being the difference between the gaming tax based on the actual gross gaming revenues and that of the specified minimum amount. Based on the maximum number of gaming tables and gaming machines we are currently authorized to operate, if the monthly special gaming taxes paid during the year aggregates to less than 4.50 billion patacas (approximately 560 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), we would be required to pay the difference as the special annual gaming premium. 
 (6) We are required to pay an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion, which is based on the number and type of gaming tables and gaming machines we operate. Based on the gaming tables and gaming machines (which is at the maximum number of tables and machines currently allowed by the Macao government) in operation as of January 1, 2023, the annual premium payable to the Macao government is approximately 40 million for the years ending December 31, 2024 through December 31, 2028, respectively, and 158 million in aggregate thereafter through the termination of the Concession in December 2032. 
 (7) Under the Handover Record, we are required to make annual payments of 750 patacas per square meter for the first three years and 2,500 patacas per square meter for the following seven years (approximately 93 and 311, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023). The annual payment of 750 patacas per square meter will be adjusted with the Macao average price index of the corresponding preceding year for years two and three and the annual payment of 2,500 patacas per square meter will be adjusted with the Macao average price index of the corresponding preceding year for years five through ten. 
 (8) We are party to certain operating leases for real estate, which primarily include 290 million related to long-term land leases in Macao with an anticipated lease term of 50 years, 148 million related to a long-term land lease in New York with a 26-year lease term, 16 million related to a long-term land lease in Las Vegas with a 40-year lease term, and 20 million related to office space in Singapore with a 5-year lease term. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 16 Leases for further details on operating leases. 
 (9) Mall deposits consist of refundable security deposits received from mall tenants. 
 (10) Primarily consists of all other non-cancellable contractual obligations and primarily relates to certain hotel management and service agreements, as described below. The amounts exclude open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received as these agreements generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Some of our hotel properties operate pursuant to management agreements with various experienced third-party hotel operators (management companies), whereby the management company controls the day-to-day operations of each of these hotels, and we are granted limited approval rights with respect to certain of the management company s actions. The non-cancelable period of our management agreements ranges from 14 to 40 years with various extension provisions and some with early termination options. Each management company receives a base management fee, generally a percentage of revenue as defined. There are also monthly fees for certain support services and some also include incentive fees based on attaining certain financial thresholds. Additionally, the Company's non-cancelable contractual obligations also include agreements with certain celebrities and professional sports leagues and teams for the hosting of events, advertising, marketing, promotional and sponsorship opportunities in order to promote the Company s brand and services.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information currently available to us and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We believe the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Provision for Expected Credit Losses 
 We maintain a provision for expected credit losses on casino, hotel and mall receivables and regularly evaluate the balances. We apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due. The reserve percentages are based on estimated loss rates supported by historical observed default rates over the expected life of the receivable and are adjusted for forward-looking information. We also specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the account, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information and adjust the aforementioned reserve with the results from the individual reserve analysis. We also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves. 
 Account balances are written off against the provision when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. Credit or marker play was 10.6 and 11.9 of table games play at our Macao properties and Marina Bay Sands, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2023. Our provision for casino credit losses was 40.2 and 61.6 of gross casino receivables as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our provision for credit losses from our hotel and other receivables is not material. 
 Litigation Accrual 
 We are subject to various claims and legal actions. We estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions based on all relevant facts and circumstances currently available and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets when it is determined such contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable. 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 Property and Equipment 
 As of December 31, 2023, we had net property and equipment of 11.44 billion, representing 52.5 of our total assets. We depreciate property and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal considerations, such as contractual life. Future events, such as property expansions, property developments, new competition or new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. The estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a prospective basis. 
 For assets to be held and used (including projects under development), fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of impairment exists, we first group our assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the asset group ). Secondly, we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows directly associated with and expected to arise from the completion, use and eventual disposition of such asset group. We estimate the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. 
 To estimate the undiscounted cash flows of our asset groups, we consider all potential cash flows scenarios, which are probability weighted based on management's estimates given current conditions. Determining the recoverability of our asset groups is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimated cash flows, probability weighting of potential scenarios, costs to complete construction for assets under development, growth rates and future market conditions, among others. Future changes to our estimates and assumptions based upon changes in macro-economic factors, regulatory environments, operating results or management's intentions may result in future changes to the recoverability of our asset groups. 
 Gaming Assets under the Macao Concession 
 As we will continue to operate the Gaming Assets, as defined in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7 Property and Equipment, Net, in the same manner as under the previous subconcession, obtain substantially all of the economic benefits and bear all of the risks arising from the use of these assets, as well as assuming VML will be successful in being awarded a new concession upon expiry of the current concession, we will continue to recognize these Gaming Assets as property and equipment over their remaining estimated useful lives. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (including federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. 
 Our foreign and U.S. tax rate differential reflects the fact that U.S. tax rates are higher than the statutory tax rates in Singapore and Macao of 17 and 12 , respectively. In August 2018, we received an exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period of January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022. In September 2022, we received an additional extension of this exemption for the period June 27, 2022 through December 31, 2022. On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that VML and its peers would continue to receive this exemption for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. We entered into an agreement with the Macao government in April 2019, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for payments as a substitution for a 12 tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits, namely a payment of 38 million patacas (approximately 5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) for 2021 and a payment of 18 million patacas (approximately 2 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) for the period between January 1, 2022 through June 26, 2022. We are in discussions for a new shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 government, which would commence effective as of January 1, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflects a continuation of the exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance and a new shareholder dividend tax agreement. 
 Accounting standards regarding income taxes require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a more-likely-than-not realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring and tax planning strategies. 
 We recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign jurisdictions of 394 million and 475 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of 3.49 billion and 3.61 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies. To the extent the financial results of these operations improve and it becomes more-likely-than-not the deferred tax assets are realizable, we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance in the period such determination is made, as appropriate. 
 Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more-likely-than-not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely, based solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examination. We recorded unrecognized tax benefits of 141 million and 136 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may be different. 
 Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Macao, and Singapore. We could be subject to examination for tax years beginning in 2019 in Macao and Singapore and tax years 2010 through 2015 and 2020 through 2022 in the U.S.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposures to market risk are interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our operations outside the United States, which we may manage through the use of futures, options, caps, forward contracts and similar instruments. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt was approximately 13.53 billion, compared to its contractual value of 14.09 billion. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on recent trades, if available, and indicative pricing from market information (level 2 inputs). A hypothetical 100 basis point change in market rates would cause the fair value of our long-term debt to change by 304 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in SOFR, HIBOR and SOR would cause our annual interest cost on our long-term debt to change by approximately 29 million. 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 Foreign currency transaction losses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were 8 million primarily due to U.S. dollar denominated debt issued by SCL and by Singapore dollar denominated intercompany debt reported in U.S. dollars. We may be vulnerable to changes in the U.S. dollar/SGD and U.S. dollar/pataca exchange rates. Based on balances as of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar/SGD exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately 21 million and a hypothetical 1 weakening of the U.S. dollar/pataca exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately 71 million (net of the impact from the foreign currency swap agreements). The pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar (within a narrow range). We maintain a significant amount of our operating funds in the same currencies in which we have obligations thereby reducing our exposure to currency fluctuations.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands Corp.: 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Las Vegas Sands Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 7, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Accounts Receivable, net - Provision for Expected Credit Losses on Casino Receivables - Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company maintains a provision for expected credit losses on casino, hotel and mall receivables and regularly evaluates the balance. A substantial portion of the provision for credit losses relates to gross casino receivables. The Company records the provision for credit losses on casino receivables by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and days past due. The reserve percentages are based on estimated loss rates supported by historical observed default rates over the

 expected life of the casino receivable and are adjusted for forward-looking information. The Company also specifically analyzes the collectability of each casino patron account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age of the casino patron's account, the casino patron's financial condition, collection history, and any other known information and adjusts the aforementioned reserve with the results from the individual reserve analysis. 
 Auditing the provision of expected credit losses on casino receivables involved a high degree of auditor's subjectivity and an increased extent of effort related to the collectability of the casino patron accounts receivable, especially as it relates to management s judgments in evaluating the qualitative factors impacting the individual reserve adjustment. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures performed in testing management's judgments and estimates used to determine the provision for credit losses on casino receivables included the following, among others: 
 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the granting of casino credit, controls over the collection processes, and management s review controls over the assessment of the collectability of casino receivables, including the quantitative and qualitative information used by management in those controls. 
 Performed a retrospective analysis of historical reserves evaluating subsequent collections and write-offs. 
 For a selection of casino receivables, we (1) obtained evidence related to payment history and correspondence with the casino patron, (2) evaluated management s use of qualitative and quantitative information in establishing a provision for expected credit losses on casino receivables, and (3) examined subsequent settlement, if any.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands Corp.: 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Las Vegas Sands Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO . 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 7, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Pursuant to the terms of the Forward Agreement, VVDI II made an up-front payment of HKD billion (approximately million at exchange rates as of the date of the transaction) to the Dealer on December 6, 2023, (the Maximum Notional Amount ), and the Dealer agreed to deliver to VVDI II shares of SCL s common stock in an amount up to the Maximum Notional Amount upon completion.

 All purchases under the Forward Purchase Transaction will be completed by June 2024 (the Scheduled End Date ), although the exact date of completion will depend on whether the Dealer exercises its acceleration option under the Forward Agreement.

 The Company's operations in Macao are subject to a 12 statutory income tax rate, but in connection with the 35 gaming tax, VML and its peers received a corporate income tax exemption in Macao that exempted the Company from paying corporate income tax on profits generated by gaming operations through December 31, 2022. On February 5, 2024, the Macao government provided notice that VML and its peers would continue to receive this exemption for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2027. 
 Additionally, in April 2019, the Company entered into a shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government, effective through June 26, 2022, providing for payments as a substitution for a tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits; namely an annual payment of

The Company is in discussions for a new shareholder dividend tax agreement with the Macao government, which would commence effective as of January 1, 2023. 
 The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects a continuation of the exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance and a new shareholder dividend tax agreement.

 Evidence gathering by the Macao First Instance commenced by letters rogatory, which was completed on March 14, 2019. 
 On July 15, 2019, AAEC submitted a request to the Macao First Instance Court to increase the amount of its claim to billion patacas (approximately billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023), allegedly representing lost profits from 2004 to 2018, and reserving its right to claim for lost profits up to 2022. On September 4, 2019, the Macao First Instance Court allowed AAEC s amended request. The U.S. Defendants appealed the decision allowing the amended claim on September 17, 2019; the Macao First Instance Court accepted the appeal on September 26, 2019, and that appeal is currently pending. 
 On April 16, 2021, the U.S. Defendants moved to reschedule the trial because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Macao First Instance Court denied the U.S. Defendants motion on May 28, 2021. The U.S. Defendants appealed that ruling on June 16, 2021, and that appeal is currently pending. 
 The trial began on June 16, 2021. By order dated June 17, 2021, the Macao First Instance Court scheduled additional trial dates in late 2021 to hear witnesses who were subject to COVID-19 travel restrictions that prevented or severely limited their ability to enter Macao. The U.S. Defendants appealed certain aspects of the Macao First Instance Court s June 17, 2021 order, and that appeal is currently pending. 
 On July 10, 2021, the U.S. Defendants were notified of an invoice for supplemental court fees totaling million patacas (approximately million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2023) based on Plaintiff s July 15, 2019 amendment. By motion dated July 20, 2021, the U.S. Defendants moved for an order withdrawing that invoice. The Macao First Instance Court denied that motion by order dated September 11, 2021. The U.S. Defendants appealed that order on September 23, 2021, and that appeal is currently pending. By order dated September 29, 2021, the Macao First Instance Court ordered that the invoice for supplemental court fees be stayed pending resolution of that appeal.

The U.S. Defendants appealed that order on November 10, 2022 and on January 6, 2023, submitted the appeal brief, and that appeal remains pending. 
 On October 9, 2023, the U.S. Defendants were notified that the Macao Second Instance Court had invited Plaintiff to amend its appeal brief, primarily to separate out matters of fact from matters of law, and Plaintiff had submitted an amended appeal brief on October 5, 2023. The U.S. Defendants responded to Plaintiff s amended appeal brief on October 30, 2023. On November 8, 2023, the Macao Second Instance Court issued an order concluding that Plaintiff may have litigated in bad faith by exceeding the scope of permissible amendments to its appeal brief and invited responses from the parties. Plaintiff moved for clarification of the November 8 order on November 22, 2023, and the U.S. Defendants responded to the November 8 order on November 23, 2023. On January 5, 2024, the Macao Second Instance Court rejected Plaintiff's request for clarification. This matter is currently pending the Macao Second Instance Court's decision. 
 Management has determined that, based on proceedings to date, it is currently unable to determine the probability of the outcome of this matter or the range of reasonably possible loss, if any. The Company intends to defend this matter vigorously.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 Not applicable. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and have concluded they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 It should be noted any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that had a material effect, or was reasonably likely to have a material effect, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and 
 (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).

Table of Contents 

Based on this assessment, management concluded, as of December 31, 2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on this framework.

The Board may, in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting of Stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication in accordance with Nevada law. 
 
 2.2 Annual Meeting . A meeting of Stockholders shall be held annually for the election of Directors at such date and time as may be designated by resolution of the Board from time to time. Any other business may be transacted at the annual meeting. 
 
 2.3 Special Meetings . Special meetings of Stockholders may be called only by (a) the Chairman or (b) a majority of the members of the Board and may not be called by any other person or persons. Business transacted at any special meeting of Stockholders shall be limited to the purpose stated in the notice. 
 
 2.4 Fixing Record Date . For the purpose of (a) determining the Stockholders entitled (i) to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment thereof or (ii) to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or (b) any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date was adopted by the Board and which record date shall not be (x) in the case of clause (a)(i) above, more than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and (y) in the case of clause (a)(ii) or (b) above, more than 60 days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed 
 
 2.4.1 the record date for determining Stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of Stockholders shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held and 
 
 2.4.2 the record date for determining Stockholders for any purpose other than those specified in Section 2.4.1 hereof shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 
 When a determination of Stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Stockholders has been made as provided in this Section 2.4, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
 
 2.5 Notice of Meetings of Stockholders. Whenever under the provisions of applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, Stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, notice shall be given stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which Stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for 

which the meeting is called. Notice of any meeting shall be given, not less than 10 nor more than 59 days before the date of the meeting, to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, with postage prepaid, directed to the Stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice required by this Section 2.5 has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. Any meeting of Stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If, however, the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each Stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 
 
 2.6 Waivers of Notice . Waiver by a Stockholder in writing of a notice required to be given to such Stockholder shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, whether executed and or delivered before or after such meeting. Attendance by a Stockholder at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except when the Stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Stockholders need be specified in any waiver of notice. 
 
 2.7 List of Stockholders . With the frequency required by law, the Secretary shall prepare a list of the Corporation s stockholders, which shall be made available for inspection and copying as and to the extent required by applicable law, including without limitation Section 78.105 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. In addition, the Secretary shall prepare and make, or cause to be prepared and made, at least 10 days before every meeting of Stockholders, a complete list of the Stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each Stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each Stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any Stockholder, the Stockholder s agent or attorney, at the Stockholder s expense, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during the meeting and during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. 
 
 2.8 Quorum of Stockholders Adjournment . At each meeting of Stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority in voting power of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting of Stockholders, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting, except that, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a quorum shall consist of no less than a majority in voting power of the shares of such class or series or classes or series. When a quorum is present to organize a meeting of Stockholders and for purposes of voting on any matter, the quorum for such meeting or matter is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any Stockholders. In the absence of a quorum, the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy at any meeting of Stockholders, including an adjourned meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn such meeting to another time and place. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be 

counted for quorum purposes provided , however , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 
 
 2.9 Voting Proxies . Subject to any voting rights that may be granted to a holder of shares of a series of the Corporation s preferred stock then outstanding, every Stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of Stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such Stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Except as otherwise provided by Articles 5, 8 and 9 of the Articles of Incorporation, Sections 3.3, 3.6 and 6.7 of these By-laws, any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws subsequently adopted requiring a different proportion, the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, applicable law or pursuant to any rules or regulations applicable to the Corporation or its securities, at any meeting of Stockholders, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon. At all meetings of Stockholders for the election of Directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. Each Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder by proxy but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after six months from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period, not to exceed seven years. A proxy shall be irrevocable if the written authorization states that it is irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A Stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting the Stockholder s shares in person or by delivering to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or by delivering a new proxy bearing a later date. 
 
 2.10 Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Election at Meetings of Stockholders . The Board, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders, may appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting, the person presiding at the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes and ballots, (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, or any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless any court properly applying jurisdiction over the Corporation upon application by a Stockholder shall determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of Stockholders, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election. 

2.11 Conduct of Meetings Organization Director Nominations and Other Stockholder Proposals . 
 
 (a) The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of Stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. At each meeting of Stockholders, the President, or in the absence of the President, the Chairman, or if there is no Chairman or if there be one and the Chairman is absent, a Vice President, and in case more than one Vice President shall be present, that Vice President designated by the Board (or in the absence of any such designation, the most senior Vice President, based on age, present), shall preside over the meeting. Any presiding officer of a meeting may delegate its duties and responsibilities to another officer entitled to preside over a meeting pursuant to the preceding sentence. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as are adopted by the Board, the person presiding over any meeting of Stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the presiding officer of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting applicable to Stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the person presiding over the meeting shall determine (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding officer at any meeting of Stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding officer should so determine, such person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of Stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. The Secretary, or in his or her absence, one of the Assistant Secretaries, shall act as secretary of the meeting. In case none of the officers above designated to act as the person presiding over the meeting or as secretary of the meeting, respectively, shall be present, a person presiding over the meeting or a secretary of the meeting, as the case may be, shall be designated by the Board, and in case the Board has not so acted, in the case of the designation of a person to act as secretary of the meeting, 
 the person to act as secretary of the meeting shall be designated by the person presiding over the meeting. 
 
 (b) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as Directors. Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at an annual meeting or special meeting of Stockholders only (i) by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) by any nominating committee designated by the Board or (iii) by any Stockholder of the Corporation who was a Stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary, who is entitled to vote for the election of Directors at the meeting and who complies with (A) the applicable provisions of Section 2.11(d) hereof and (B) the applicable requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act (persons nominated in accordance with (iii) above are referred to herein as Stockholder nominees ).

To be properly brought before an annual meeting of Stockholders, (i) business must be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a Stockholder who was a Stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.11 is delivered to the Secretary, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the applicable provisions of Section 2.11(d) hereof (business brought before the meeting in accordance with (iii) above is referred to as Stockholder business ).

For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation that constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted, vested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such documentation to the NYSE.

 4 REQUIREMENTS OF THE POLICY 
 Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation 
 In the event of a Restatement, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received during the Lookback Period (a) that is then-outstanding but has not yet been paid shall be automatically and immediately forfeited and (b) that has been paid to any person shall be subject to reasonably prompt repayment to the Company Group in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy. The Committee must pursue (and shall not have the discretion to waive) the forfeiture and 
 2 

or repayment of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy, except as provided below. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or, if the Committee is not composed entirely of independent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and or recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture and or recovery would be impracticable due to any of the following circumstances (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example, reasonable legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (following reasonable attempts by the Company Group to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the documentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to the NYSE), (ii) pursuing such recovery would violate the Company s Home Country laws adopted prior to November 28, 2022 (provided that the Company obtains an opinion of Home Country counsel acceptable to the NYSE that recovery would result in such a violation and provides such opinion to the NYSE), or (iii) recovery would likely cause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Company Group, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 Means of Repayment 
 In the event that the Committee determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the Committee shall provide written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the Company Group for such person, and the person shall satisfy such repayment in a manner and on such terms as required by the Committee, and the Company Group shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any amount owed to the person by the Company Group, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Company Group to the person, or to take any and all necessary actions to reasonably promptly recoup the repayment amount from the person, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, including without limitation, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance thereunder. If the Committee does not specify a repayment timing in the written notice described above, the applicable person shall be required to repay the Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company Group by wire, cash or cashier s check no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice. 
 No Indemnification 
 No person shall be indemnified, insured or reimbursed by the Company Group in respect of any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, nor shall any person receive any advancement of expenses for disputes related to any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, and no person shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company Group for any premiums paid by such person for any third-party insurance policy covering potential recovery obligations under this Policy. For this purpose, indemnification includes any modification to current compensation arrangements or other means that would amount to de facto indemnification (for example, providing the person a new cash award which would be cancelled to effect the recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation). In no event shall the Company Group be required to award any person an additional payment if any Restatement would result in a higher incentive compensation payment. 
 Miscellaneous 
 This Policy will be administered and interpreted by the Committee. Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties. Any discretionary determinations of the Committee under this Policy need not be uniform with respect to all persons, and may be made selectively amongst persons, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. 
 This Policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as it may be amended from time to time, and any related rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC or the NYSE, including any additional or new requirements that become effective after the Effective Date which upon effectiveness shall be deemed to automatically amend this Policy to the extent necessary to comply with such additional or new requirements. 
 The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be 
 3 

applied to the maximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy is not dependent upon the Company Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any requirement to provide applicable documentation to the NYSE. 
 The rights of the Company Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights of recoupment, or remedies or rights other than recoupment, that may be available to the Company Group pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement or any other policy, code of conduct, employee handbook, employment agreement, equity award agreement, or other plan or agreement of the Company Group.
