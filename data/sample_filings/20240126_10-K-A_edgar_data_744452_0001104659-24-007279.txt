in such ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners 10 stockholders also are
required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of the
copies of such forms furnished to us during or with respect to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as the case may be, and
upon written representations from these reporting persons, we believe that all reports required by Section 16(a) applicable
to our officers, directors and 10 stockholders were filed on a timely basis, as disclosed in the forms described above, during the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2023. 

Governance of the Company 

Code of Ethics 

Our Board of Directors has adopted a code
of ethics as defined by regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act (our Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer,
our Chief Financial Officer and those officers and employees responsible for financial reporting. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
is designed to codify the ethical standards that we believe are reasonably designed to deter wrong-doing and promote honest and ethical
conduct.

We have established procedures to ensure that
suspected violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may be reported anonymously. A current copy of our Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics is available on our website at https://investors.adnas.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents . A copy may also
be obtained, free of charge, from us upon a request directed to Applied DNA Sciences, Inc., 50 Health Sciences Drive, Stony Brook,

and Ethics granted to directors and officers by posting such information on our website available at www.adnas.com and/or in our
public filings with the SEC. 

Board Committees 

The Board of Directors maintains three committees:
the audit committee, compensation committee and the nominating committee. 

Audit Committee 

Messrs. Catell, Ceccoli, and Shamash (Chairperson)
served on the audit committee during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and continue to serve on the audit committee. The
Board of Directors has determined that each member of the audit committee is independent within the meaning of the director independence
standards of the Company and Nasdaq as well as the heightened director independence standards of the SEC for audit committee members,
including Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. The Board of Directors has also determined that each of the members of the
audit committee is financially sophisticated and is able to read and understand consolidated financial statements and that Dr. Shamash
is an audit committee financial expert as defined in the Exchange Act. During fiscal 2023, the audit committee held four
formal meetings. 

The composition and responsibilities of the audit
committee and the attributes of its members, as reflected in the charter, are intended to be in accordance with applicable requirements
for corporate audit committees. The audit committee charter will be reviewed, and amended if necessary, on an annual basis. 

The audit committee assists the Board of Directors
in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to our financial statements and the disclosure and financial reporting process, our
system of internal controls, our internal audit function, the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent registered
public accounting firm, compliance with our code of ethics and legal and regulatory requirements. The audit committee has the sole authority
to appoint, retain, terminate, compensate and oversee the work of the independent registered public accounting firm, as well as to pre-approve
all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 

Compensation Committee 

Messrs. Ceccoli and Shamash (Chairperson)
and Ms. Schmalz Shaheen served on the compensation committee during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and continue to
serve on the compensation committee. The compensation committee reviews and approves salaries and bonuses for all officers, reviews and
approves non-employee directors compensation, administers options outstanding under our stock incentive plan, provides advice
and carries out the responsibilities required by SEC rules. The compensation committee believes that its processes and oversight should
be directed toward attracting, retaining and motivating employees and non-employee directors to promote and advance our interests and
strategic goals. As requested by the compensation committee, the Chief Executive Officer will provide information and may participate
in discussions regarding compensation for other executive officers. The compensation committee also considers other general industry
information and trends if available. During fiscal 2023, the compensation committee held one formal meeting. 

9 

Nominating Committee 

Messrs. Shamash (Chairperson) and Simon and
Ms. Schmalz Shaheen served on the nominating committee during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and continue to serve
on the nominating committee. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the nominating committee is independent within
the meaning of the director independence standards of the Company, Nasdaq and the SEC. 

The nominating committee is responsible for, among
other things: reviewing the Board of Directors composition, procedures and committees, and making recommendations on these matters
to the Board of Directors; and reviewing, soliciting and making recommendations to the Board of Directors and stockholders with respect
to candidates for election to the Board of Directors. During fiscal 2023, the nominating committee held one formal meeting. 

ITEM 11. 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Compensation Overview 

The compensation committee has overall responsibility
for approving and evaluating the compensation arrangements for our named executive officers. Our named executive officers for fiscal
2023 are our Chief Executive Officer and President, Dr. James Hayward, our Chief Financial Officer, Beth Jantzen, our Chief Operating
Officer and Chief Information Officer, Judith Murrah, and our Chief Legal Officer, Clay Shorrock. Our Chief Executive Officer provides
recommendations to the compensation committee with respect to the compensation of the named executive officers other than himself. However,
the compensation committee is free to make decisions that are contrary to the Chief Executive Officer s recommendations. 

Our Executive Compensation Philosophy
and Objectives 

General

The fundamental purpose of our executive compensation
program is to assist us in achieving our financial and operating performance objectives. Specifically, we attempt to tailor an executive s
compensation to (1) retain and motivate the executive, (2) reward him or her upon the achievement of Company-wide and individual
performance, and (3) align the executive s interest with the creation of long-term stockholder value, without encouraging
excessive risk taking. To that end, and within the context of the stage of our company, we have historically compensated our named executive
officers through a mix of base salary, equity-based incentives and cash bonuses. 

Our business model is based on our ability to
establish long-term relationships with clients and to maintain our strong mission, client focus, entrepreneurial spirit and team orientation.
We have sought to create an executive compensation package that balances short-term versus long-term components, in ways we believe are
most appropriate to motivate senior management and reward them for achieving key business goals. 

10 

Base Salary 

We did not change the annual base salary for any
of our named executive officers in fiscal 2023, and their respective annual base salaries remained as follows: Dr. Hayward, 450,000,
Ms. Jantzen, 300,000, Ms. Murrah, 325,000 and Mr. Shorrock, 300,000. Effective as of January 1, 2024, Dr. Hayward
and Ms. Murrah voluntarily reduced their annual base salaries to 250,000 and 243,750, respectively, in response to the then current
cash position of the Company. This voluntary reduction is effective until March 31, 2024. 

Bonuses 

While the compensation committee determined that
Dr. Hayward was eligible to receive a discretionary bonus in the amount of 500,000 with respect to his performance for fiscal 2023,
on January 19, 2024, Dr. Hayward elected not to receive any cash incentive or other bonus for fiscal 2023, in light of the
Company s current cash position. 

On January 23, 2023, upon recommendation
from the compensation committee, the Board of Directors approved a discretionary cash bonus, in respect of fiscal 2022 performance, for
each of Ms. Jantzen, Mr. Shorrock and Ms. Murrah. 

The discretionary cash incentive bonus amount
totaled 99,000 (33 of their annual base salary rate) for each of Ms. Jantzen and Mr. Shorrock and 107,250 (33 of her annual
base salary rate) for Ms. Murrah. 

As of the date of this report, the compensation
committee and the Board of Directors have not yet determined whether any bonus will be granted to Ms. Jantzen, Mr. Shorrock
or Ms. Murrah in respect of fiscal 2023 performance. To the extent that any such named executive officer ultimately receives a bonus
in respect of fiscal 2023 performance, the Company will disclose same by way of a separate filing under Form 8-K. 

Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation 

Our long-term compensation program has historically
consisted solely of stock options. Stock option grants made to executive officers are designed to provide them with an incentive to execute
their responsibilities in such a way as to generate long-term benefit to us and our stockholders. 

We believe that, by only rewarding the creation of stockholder value,
stock options provide our executive officers with an effective risk and reward profile. 

On
January 23, 2023, upon recommendation from the compensation committee , the Board of Directors approved, for each of
Ms. Jantzen, Mr. Shorrock and Ms. Murrah, a compensation plan consisting of (i) a grant of restricted stock units,
each representing the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock upon vesting RSUs ), and (ii) a
grant of stock options, each representing the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock upon exercise Options ),
as further described below. On March 23, 2023, the compensation committee approved and granted the RSUs and the Options under the
Company s 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. 

RSUs.
 As noted above, the compensation plan provided for the grant of RSUs, with each participating named executive officer awarded
an RSU grant with a grant date fair value equal to 33 of the named executive officer s annual base salary (i.e., 99,000, in the
case of each of Ms. Jantzen and Mr. Shorrock, and 107,250, in the case of Ms. Murrah). Each of Ms. Jantzen and Mr. Shorrock
received a grant of 91,667 RSUs, and Ms. Murrah received a grant of 99,306 RSUs. The RSUs will vest in full on the 12-month anniversary
of the date of grant, subject to the relevant named executive officer s continued employment with the Company. There is no acceleration
of vesting upon any termination of employment that occurs prior to the applicable vesting date. 

11 

Options .
Also as noted above, the compensation plan provided for the grant of Options, with each participating named executive officer awarded
an Option grant with a grant date fair value equal to 34 of the named executive officer s annual base salary (i.e., 102,000,
in the case of each of Ms. Jantzen and Mr. Shorrock, and 110,500, in the case of Ms. Murrah). Each of Ms. Jantzen
and Mr. Shorrock received a grant of 100,000 Options, and Ms. Murrah received a grant of 108,333 Options. The Options have
a 10-year term and will vest in equal 25 installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to the relevant
named executive officer s continued employment with the Company. There is no acceleration of vesting upon any termination of employment
that occurs prior to the applicable vesting date. 

Benefits

We provide the following benefits to our named
executive officers on the same basis as the benefits provided to all employees: 

health and dental insurance; 

life insurance; 

short-and long-term disability; and 

401(k) Plan (currently there is no employer match) 

We believe these benefits are generally consistent
with those offered by other companies and specifically with those companies with which we compete for employees. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None of the members of our compensation committee
is or has been an officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served,
as a member of the compensation committee or director (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of
any such committee, the entire Board of Directors) of any entity that has one or more executive officers who will serve on our compensation
committee or our Board of Directors.

Employment Agreement with Dr. James A. Hayward 

The following is a discussion of our employment
agreement with Dr. Hayward as of January 1, 2024 and, where indicated, compensation actions prior to such date. 

The Chief Executive Officer is the only named
executive officer with an employment agreement. Effective as of January 1, 2024, Dr. Hayward voluntarily reduced his salary
to 250,000 in response to the then current cash position of the Company. This voluntary reduction is effective until March 31,
2024. 

The initial term of Dr. Hayward s employment
agreement was from July 1, 2016 to July 1, 2017, and the term of the employment agreement renews automatically on an annual
basis thereafter, unless either party provides the other with 90 days advance written notice of non-renewal. The employment agreement
provides for an annual base salary, which is described above in the section entitled Base Salary, and the Board of Directors,
acting in its discretion, may also grant annual bonuses and annual equity awards to Dr. Hayward, provided that Dr. Hayward
may not be treated less favorably with respect to annual bonuses or annual equity awards than other executives of the Company. Dr. Hayward
will be eligible to participate in retirement, welfare and incentive plans available to the Company s other employees. The employment
agreement also provides for the following limited perquisites: an automobile allowance of up to 1,500 per month, a gas allowance, the
use of an outside driver for up to 20 hours per week, a gym membership and an airline club membership. 

The employment agreement with Dr. Hayward
also provides that if he is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined in the employment agreement and summarized
below) or if Dr. Hayward terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement and summarized
below), then, in addition to payment or provision of any earned and unpaid base salary, bonus and benefits, and subject to his delivery
of an executed general release and continuing compliance with restrictive covenants, Dr. Hayward will be entitled to receive: (i) a
pro rata portion (based on the number of days elapsed from the beginning of the Company s fiscal year to the date of his termination
of employment) of the greater of (A) the annual bonus he would have received if his employment had continued through the end of
the fiscal year of termination and (B) the prior year s annual bonus; (ii) installment payments for two years following
termination in an aggregate amount equal to the greater of (A) 2.99 times Dr. Hayward s base salary and (B) two
times the sum of (I) Dr. Hayward s base salary and (II) Dr. Hayward s prior year s annual bonus
(or, if greater, Dr. Hayward s target bonus (if any) for the fiscal year of termination); (iii) Company-paid COBRA continuation
coverage for 18 months post-termination; (iv) continuing life insurance benefits (if any) for two years post-termination;
and (v) extended exercisability of any outstanding vested stock options and stock appreciation rights (until three years from
the termination date or, if earlier, until the expiration of the fixed stock option or stock appreciation right term). 

If
termination of Dr. Hayward s employment is triggered by the Company without cause or by Dr. Hayward for good reason,
in each case, within six months before or two years after a change in control of the Company (as defined in the
employment agreement), then, the severance payments that would otherwise have been paid in installments will be paid in a lump sum. Further,
unless assumed or continued by the acquiror, all of Dr. Hayward s outstanding stock options and other equity incentive awards
will become fully vested upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company (whether or not his employment is terminated in connection
with such change in control). The exercisability period of outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights would be extended
until three years following the change in control (or, if later, until three years following a qualifying termination after
a change in control), or, if earlier, until the earlier expiration of the fixed stock option or stock appreciation right term. In addition,
the employment agreement provides that if the payments and benefits due to Dr. Hayward in connection with a change in control would
be subject to an excise tax under Section 280G of the Code, they will be reduced to the maximum amount that would not trigger the
excise tax, unless Dr. Hayward would be better off (on an after-tax basis) receiving all of the payments and benefits and paying
all necessary applicable taxes. Additionally, if, following a change in control, the Company fails to comply with any of its obligations
under the employment agreement or the Company takes any action to declare the employment agreement void or unenforceable or institutes
any litigation or other legal action designed to deny, diminish or to recover from Dr. Hayward (or his beneficiary) the payments
and benefits intended to be provided, then Dr. Hayward (or his beneficiary, as the case may be) shall be entitled to select and
retain counsel at the expense of the Company to represent him (or his beneficiary) in connection with the good faith initiation or defense
of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated
with the Company or any successor thereto in any jurisdiction. 

15 

Upon a termination of his employment due to death
or disability (as defined in the employment agreement), Dr. Hayward will generally be entitled to receive the same
payments and benefits he would have received if his employment had been terminated by the Company without cause, other than the installment
payments and the continuing life insurance benefits, and additionally, the extended exercisability provisions would apply to any outstanding
stock options only. 

For purposes of the employment agreement, cause 
means Dr. Hayward: (i) is convicted of or pleads nolo contendere to a felony, (ii) commits fraud or a material act or
omission involving dishonesty affecting the assets, business or reputation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (iii) willfully
fails or refuses to carry out the material responsibilities of his employment, as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, (iv) engages
in gross negligence, willful misconduct or a pattern of behavior that has had or is reasonably likely to have a significant adverse effect
on the Company or his ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of his employment, or (v) willfully engages in any act
or omission that is in material violation of Company policy, including, without limitation, Company policy on business ethics and conduct,
and Company policy on the use of inside information and insider trading; provided, however, that, if the conduct giving rise to termination
for Cause is curable without material harm to the business or assets of the Company, Dr. Hayward will be afforded an opportunity
to effect such a cure within 30 days after notice of termination and thereby avoid a termination for Cause based upon such conduct. 

For purposes of the employment agreement, good
reason is defined as any of the following: (i) a material adverse change by the Company
of Dr. Hayward s status or position as the Chief Executive Officer, including, without limitation, a material diminution of
his position, duties, responsibilities or authority or the assignment to him of duties or responsibilities that are materially inconsistent
with his status or position; (ii) a non-voluntary reduction by the Company of his annual base salary or failure to pay same; (iii) a
breach by the Company of any of its material obligations under the employment agreement; (iv) relocation of Dr. Hayward without
his consent beyond a 75-mile radius of his then principal place of employment in violation of the employment agreement; or (v) in
connection with a change in control, the failure or refusal by the successor or acquiring company to expressly assume the obligations
of Company under the employment agreement. As a condition to terminating his employment for Good Reason, Dr. Hayward must, within
60 days after the occurrence of the event or condition giving rise to such termination, provide written notice to the Company (or the
successor or acquiring company) of his desire to terminate for Good Reason, specifying the nature of the act or omission that he deems
to constitute Good Reason. The Company shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to review and, if required, correct the situation
(and thus prevent his termination for Good Reason). 

Dr. Hayward is subject to standard restrictive
covenants, including a two-year post-employment non-compete and a two-year post-employment non-solicit of employees or customers.

ITEM 13. 
 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS,
 AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Director Independence 

The Board of Directors has determined that currently
and at all times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each of our directors other than Dr. Hayward and Mr. Anchin consisting
of Robert B. Catell, Joseph D. Ceccoli, Yacov A. Shamash, Sanford R. Simon, and Elizabeth M. Schmalz Shaheen are and were independent 
as defined by the listing standards of Nasdaq, constituting a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors as required
by the rules of Nasdaq. On July 31, 2023, Scott L. Anchin, provided notice to the Company of his intention not to stand for
re-election as director at the Company s upcoming annual meeting of stockholders held on September 19, 2023. Mr. Anchin s
term as director expired upon the election of directors at the annual meeting. The Board of Directors considers in its evaluation of
independence whether any director has a relationship with us that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying
out his or her responsibilities of a director. 

ITEM 14. 
 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 

Audit and Other Fees 

The following table sets forth fees billed to
us by our current independent auditors during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 for: (i) services rendered
for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of our quarterly financial statements, (ii) services by our auditor
that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and that are not reported as Audit
Fees, (iii) services rendered in connection with tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning, and (iv) all other fees for services
rendered.

Audit
Fees Consists of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our consolidated financial statements,
review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports, and services that are normally provided by our
independent auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements, including registration statements. 

Audit-Related
Fees Consists of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of
the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees, such as accounting
consultation and audits in connection with acquisitions. 

Tax
Fees Consists of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. 

All
Other Fees Consists of fees for products and services other than the services reported above. 

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant s independence
and has determined that independence has been maintained. 

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 

Our audit committee is responsible for approving
all audit, audit-related, tax and other services. The audit committee pre-approves all auditing services and permitted non-audit services,
including all fees and terms to be performed for us by our independent auditor at the beginning of the fiscal year. Non-audit services
are reviewed and pre-approved by project at the beginning of the fiscal year. Any additional non-audit services contemplated by us after
the beginning of the fiscal year are submitted to the chairman of our audit committee for pre-approval prior to engaging our independent
auditor for such services. These interim pre-approvals are reviewed with the full audit committee at its next meeting for ratification.
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, all services performed by Marcum LLP were pre-approved by our audit committee
in accordance with these policies and applicable SEC regulations.
