EXPLANATORY
NOTE 

Restatement
and Revision 

As previously reported by the Company in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on November 8, 2023, the Audit Committee (the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, in consultation with the Company s management, determined that (i) the Company s
previously issued audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 and for the years ended December 31, 2020,
2021 and 2022 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, (ii) associated reports of the Company s independent registered
public accounting firm, Marcum LLP Marcum ), and (iii) the Company s previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements during those years and for the first and second quarters of 2023 included in the Company s Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q (the Subject Periods contained the accounting errors relating to the compliance with U.S. GAAP in connection
with the Company s accounting policies for capitalizing software development costs. The errors related primarily to the application
of the relevant accounting standards to projects, including the timing of capitalization with respect to software development projects
and the nature of costs eligible for capitalization. 

As
a result of these errors, the Audit Committee determined that the Company s previously issued consolidated financial
statements for the Subject Periods should no longer be relied upon and should be restated. Similarly, any previously issued or filed
reports, press releases, earnings releases, investor presentations or other communications of the Company describing the
Company s financial results or other financial information relating to the Subject Periods should no longer be relied
upon. 

Additionally, the previous reports of Marcum LLP on the Company s
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 likewise should
no longer be relied upon. 

As of the
date of this report, the Company has filed with the SEC an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022 and to the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 that include financial statements
that amend and restate the previously issued unaudited consolidated financial statements originally filed with such filings and reports.
The foregoing Quarterly Reports amend and restate the financial statements as of and for the comparable 2022 periods. 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes financial statements that amend and
restate the Company s unaudited financial statements as of and for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022.
Please see Note 2 to the unaudited financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of the
restatement and the impact on the specific accounts in such unaudited financial statements.

million, and the Company had working capital in addition to
cash of million.
The Company recorded net income of 
 million and 
 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively. Net income includes non-cash stock-based compensation of 
 million and 
 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively. Working capital of 
 million includes 
 million of deferred income. 

Historically,
the Company has generally had positive cash flows from operating activities and has relied on a combination of cash flows provided by
operations and the incurrence of debt and/or the refinancing of existing debt to fund its obligations. Cash flows provided by operations
amounted to 
 million and 
 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Management
currently believes that the Company s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations, ability to control
and defer capital projects and amounts available from the Company s external borrowings will be sufficient to fund the Company s
net cash requirements through November 2024. 

million and million as well as a
decrease in Depreciation and amortization of million, and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.
Refer to reference a below. 

Revenue
and Costs to obtain a contract The Company identified
several corrections related to ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
 The Company identified certain performance obligations were delivered and therefore should
have been recognized at a specific point in time (rather than over time). Additionally, we identified
that (i) for certain Interactive Aggregator contracts, revenue should have been reported on a net, rather than gross, basis and (ii)
certain parts the Company acquired and sold to its contract manufacturer should have not been reported as revenue. These two items have
no impact to profit. The Company also identified an immaterial contract that should have
been recognized as a sales type lease rather than an operating lease. Items reported on a gross, rather than net basis are corrected
with no impact to profit. Lastly, the Company had historically expensed certain commissions in the peri od
incurred instead of capitalizing and amortizing them under the accounting framework for costs to obtain contracts with customers pursuant
to ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs Contracts with Customers .
The corrections also resulted in a decrease in Revenue - service of 
 million and 
 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively and a 
 million decrease and
 
 million increase in
Revenue product sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, a decrease in Cost of sales 
service of 
 million and 
 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and as a 
 million increase in
Cost of sales product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The corrections also resulted in an increase in Depreciation
and amortization increased by 
 million and 
 million for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively as well as a 
 increase in Interest
expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Refer to reference b below. Note 7, Contract Liabilities
and Other Disclosures and Note 19, Segment Reporting and Geographic Information have also been corrected. 

Inventory
 T he
Company identified an error in the amount capitalized for field
inventory, repair and consumable items. Refer to reference c below. Note 5,
 Inventory has also been corrected. 

Goodwill
and intangibles Through review of the appropriate
reporting units and asset groups to assess impairments at under ASC 350, Intangibles 
Goodwill and Other and ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , the Company
 identified a triggering event in the first quarter of 2020 , related to the beginning of
the COVID-19 pandemic, for which impairment assessment was required for (i) Server Based
Gaming S B G and
 A cquired B usiness reporting units and (ii)
all landbased asset groups. B ased on the assessment, we determined that an impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets occurred
in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we determined that a significant number of synergies existed from the acquisition in the
fourth quarter of 2019 and therefore a portion of the acquisition goodwill should have been reallocated to other reporting units upon
acquisition. The corrections resulted in a decrease of Depreciation and amortization of 
 million for both the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022. Refer to reference d below. 

Leasing
 The Company had not historically included in-substance fixed payments related to certain leases according to the accounting
framework in ASC 842, Leases . Refer to reference f below. Note 16, Leases has also been corrected. 

Basic
 and diluted net
income (loss) per share 
 An error to shares outstanding primarily relates to the Company not includ ing deferred
settlement equity awards that had vested in the number of outstanding shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted weighted
average number of shares outstanding pursuant to ASC 260, Earnings Per Share . Refer to reference h below. Note 12,
 Net earnings (loss) per share has also been corrected. 

Pension
 The Company had corrections to pension that primarily related to no longer updating
the plan liability/ asset quarterly to comply with US GAAP. I n addition, the Company corrected
the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the buy-in contract. The Company corrected the measurement of the plan
assets and the estimated fair value of the buy in contract. Note 18, Pension Plan has also been corrected. Refer to reference
 g below. 

Other
errors identified Through the restatement process, the Company has reclassified certain costs for salaries of service employees
and recorded an adjustment related to foreign currency impacts on an intangible. In addition to the reclassification
and intangible adjustment , the Company has corrected other adjustments that are
quantitatively immaterial, individually and in aggregate, because we are correcting for these material errors, we have decided to correct
these other adjustments. Refer to reference f below. 

Income
tax The Company updated the income tax effects for the Restatement Items. Note 14, Income Taxes has also been
updated.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

For
the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 respectively, there was no significant amounts of revenue recognized as a result of
changes in contract transaction price related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the respective prior
periods.

to the value to the customer for our performance completed to date, variable consideration which is not accounted for in accordance with
the sales-based or usage-based royalties guidance, or contracts which are not wholly unperformed, is approximately million. Of
this amount, we expect to recognize as revenue approximately through December 31, 2023, approximately through December 31, 2025,
approximately through December 31, 2027, and the remaining balance through December 31, 2029.

The Indenture contains covenants
and certain reporting requirements including the requirement to provide the Lender, within 60 days after the close of the quarter, unaudited
quarterly financial statements with footnote disclosures. The Company was unable to comply with this requirement due to the requirement
to restate previously reported financial statements as reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 8, 2023.
The debt agreement allows the Company a 30-day grace period to provide such financial information once they receive any notice of non-compliance. 
No such notice has been received. Concurrent with the filing of this 10Q with the SEC, the reporting requirement has been met.

income tax expense, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was 
and , as restated,
respectively, resulting in a million
and million
income tax expense, respectively. The Company s effective income tax rate has fluctuated primarily as a result of the
income mix between jurisdictions and increase in impact of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) due to foreign profits. 

The
income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 differs from the amount that would be expected
after applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate primarily due to changes in tax attributes in jurisdictions where realization
of benefits is not expected to occur. 

The
Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets as of both September 30, 2023 and 2022. We intend to continue
maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or
some portion of these allowances. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable
possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that
a significant portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition
of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing
and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually
achieve.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Our actual future results could differ materially from the historical results discussed below. Factors that
could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those referenced in the section
titled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

We
make forward-looking statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
For definitions of the term Forward-Looking Statements, see the definitions provided in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements at the start of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023. 

Seasonality 

Our
results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines can vary quarter on quarter
due to both supply and demand factors. Player activity for our holiday parks is generally higher in the second and third quarters of
the year, particularly during the summer months and slower during the first and fourth quarters of the year. 

Revenue 

We
generate revenue in four principal ways: i) on a participation basis, ii) on a fixed rental fee basis, iii) through product sales, iv)
managed services and v) through software license fees. Participation revenue generally includes a right to receive a share of our customers 
gaming revenue, typically as a share of net win but sometimes as a share of the handle or coin in which represents the
total amount wagered. 

Geographic
Range 

Geographically,
the majority of our revenue is derived from, and the majority of our non-current assets are attributable to, our UK operations. The remainder
of our revenue is derived from, and non-current assets attributable to, Greece and the rest of the world (including North America). 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we derived approximately 82 and 79 of our revenue from the UK (including customers
headquartered in the UK but whose revenue is generated globally), respectively, 5 and 7 from Greece, respectively, and the remaining
13 and 14 respectively across the rest of the world. The UK percentage was impacted by specific Hardware sales, which generally result
in a lower margin Low Margin sales ), this increased UK revenues for the three-month period by 39 and for the nine month
period by 16 . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we derived approximately 79 and 78 , 7 and 8 , 14 and 14 
of our revenue from the UK, Greece and the rest of the world, respectively. 

As
of September 30, 2023, our non-current assets (excluding goodwill) were attributable as follows: 71 to the UK, 11 to Greece and
18 across the rest of the world. As at December 31, 2022, our non-current assets (excluding goodwill) were attributable as follows:
79 to the UK, 6 to Greece and 15 across the rest of the world. 

23 

Foreign
Exchange 

Our
results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the translation of foreign functional currencies into
our reporting currency and the re-measurement of foreign currency transactions and balances. The impact of foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations represents the difference between current rates and prior-period rates applied to current activity. The geographic
region in which the largest portion of our business is operated is the UK and the British pound GBP is considered to
be our functional currency. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar USD ). Our results are translated from our functional
currency of GBP into the reporting currency of USD using average rates for profit and loss transactions and applicable spot rates for
period-end balances. The effect of translating our functional currency into our reporting currency, as well as translating the results
of foreign subsidiaries that have a different functional currency into our functional currency, is reported separately in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income. 

In
the section Results of Operations below, currency impacts shown have been calculated as the current-period average GBP:USD
rate less the equivalent average rate in the prior year period, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP).
The remaining difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the difference in our functional currency,
multiplied by the prior-period average GBP:USD rate. This is not a U.S. GAAP measure but is one which management believes gives a clearer
indication of results. In the tables below, variances in particular line items from period to period exclude currency translation movements,
and currency translation impacts are shown independently. 

Key
Events for the Quarter 

During
the three-month period in the Gaming segment, we continued the installation of our new UK LBO terminal Vantage into venues
of two major customers. Over 4,500 terminals were deployed during the period, with a total of 6,300 expected to be live in venues by
the end of 2023, the majority of which are Low Margin sales. In addition, Inspired announced the launch of a new VLT system for Codere
in partnership with Italian company Cristaltec. 

The
Interactive segment went live with ten new operators, including PlanetWin 365 (Italy) and ATG (Sweden), with the total number of customers
remaining the same as the previous quarter due to the reduction in the number of small-scale customers. 

The
technical trial of our new Vantage Category C cabinet successfully concluded in the quarter, with the commercial trial commencing in
October 2023. 

Agreements
signed in the three-month period include a new four-year agreement with BoyleSports (Gaming segment) and a long-term contract extension
with SNAITech (Virtual Sports segment). 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

We
use certain financial measures that are not compliant with U.S. GAAP Non-GAAP financial measures ), including EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA, to analyze our operating performance. In this discussion and analysis, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures,
define and explain these measures and provide reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures. See Non-GAAP Financial
Measures below. 

Results
of Operations 

Our
results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between our functional currency (GBP) and our reporting
currency (USD). During the periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the average GBP:USD rates for the three-month period
were 1.27 and 1.18, respectively, and for the nine-month period were 1.25 in both years. . 

The
following discussion and analysis of our results of operations has been organized in the following manner: 

a
 discussion and analysis of the Company s results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023,
 compared to the same period in 2022; and 

a
 discussion and analysis of the results of operations for each of the Company s segments (Gaming, Virtual Sports, Interactive
 and Leisure) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, including key performance
 indicator KPI analysis. 

24 

In
the discussion and analysis below, certain data may vary from the amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements due to rounding. 

For
all reported variances, refer to the overall company and segment tables shown below. All variances discussed in the overall company and
segment results are on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis, which excludes the impact of any changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. 

Restatement
Background 

On
November 2, 2023, the Company in concurrence with the Company s audit committee, concluded that our 2023 and 2022 consolidated
financial statements and our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the first two quarterly periods in 2023
and all quarterly periods in 2022, included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the respective periods(collectively the Prior
Period Financial Statements ), should no longer be relied upon due to misstatements that are described below, and that we would
restate such financial statements to make the necessary accounting corrections. Details of the restated consolidated financial statements
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 are provided below Restatement Items ). 

The
Restatements Items reflect adjustments to correct errors in certain financial statement areas including capitalized software and costs
to fulfill a contract, revenue and costs to obtain a contract, inventory, goodwill and intangibles, leasing, pension, and other reclassifications
and immaterial errors identified. The nature and impact of these adjustments are described in footnote 2 of the financial statements. 

The Company issued a revision for capitalized software and related amortization
expense in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on August 11, 2023 for the period ended June 30, 2023 (the Revision ).This
revision related to certain completed software development projects that were, but should not have been, delayed in the shift from work
in progress to completed projects. Consequently, the commencement of amortization for certain projects was delayed and the reported amortization
was lower than the actual amortization. The Revision covers the period ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022 and is
distinct from the capitalized software restatements below. The tables below have been updated to separate the impact of the Restatement
Items from the Revision.

Revenue 

Consolidated
Reported Revenue by Segment 

There
 was no Low Margin-related revenue for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2022. For the three and nine-months ended September
 30, 2023 Low margin-related revenue was 22.7 million and 27.1 million, respectively. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis increased by 16.4 million
and 37.2 million. 

For
the three-month period, Gaming revenue grew by 17.8 million predominantly due to an increase in product sales of 19.2 million, of which
 22.7 million were Low Margin sales, with differences in the timing of hardware installations impacting the underlying variance. Gaming
service revenue decreased by 1.4 million predominately due to reductions in the UK, plus 2022 included a performance bonus not available
in current year, and in Greece from the expiry of historical amortized license revenues. Virtual Sports revenue decreased 2.0 million,
with 2.3 million of the reduction from Online partially offset by a 0.3 million increase from Retail. Interactive revenue grew by 1.5
million with growth driven in the UK and European markets. Leisure revenue decreased by 0.9 million predominately driven by a reduction
in the Pubs sector. 

For
the nine-month period, Gaming revenue grew by 29.6 million predominantly due to an increase in product sales of 29.7 million, of which
 27.1 million were Low Margin sales. Virtual Sports and Interactive revenue grew by 4.1 million and 4.8 million, respectively, with
 3.1 million of the Virtuals Sports increase from Online and 1.0 million from Retail. Interactive revenue growth was driven by growth
in the UK, US and Canada. These increases were offset by a reduction in Leisure service revenue of 1.0 million predominantly due to
a reduction in the Pubs sector, partially offset by the addition of new locations in Holiday Parks. 

27 

Cost
of Sales, excluding depreciation and amortization 

Cost
of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, increased by 20.3 million
and 32.0 million, respectively. The increases were driven by a 20.8 million and 30.4 million increase in cost of product, respectively,
predominately driven by the increase in product sales and by a 0.5 million reduction and 1.6 million increase, respectively, in cost
of service, mainly driven by the movement in service revenues. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative SG A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by
 0.6 million and increased by 8.2 million, respectively. The increase in the nine-month period was driven primarily by the below
EBITDA costs of group restructure of 3.0 million, an increase in non-staff costs of 3.9 million, of which the largest increase was
professional fees of 1.7 million, and an increase in staff costs of 3.3 million, driven by an increase in headcount
predominantly from an investment in the technology and commercial areas of our business, as well as the increase in national living
wage and salary increases during the period. 

Stock-based
compensation 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded expenses of 3.3 million and 9.3 million, respectively, compared
to expenses of 2.5 million and 7.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. All expenses were related to outstanding
awards but the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 0.4 million related to award units that were fully vested on
the date of grant and therefore were expensed immediately. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included 0.7 million related
to the group restructuring. 

Depreciation
and amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization for the three-month period remained flat on a functional currency basis. 

Depreciation
and amortization for the nine-month period decreased by 0.6 million driven by an increase in Interactive of for increased software
development offset by a reduction in Leisure and Gaming as machine assets unwind. 

Net
operating income / Net Income 

Net
operating income decreased by 3.8 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2023, and decreased by 3.6 million for the nine-months
ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. For the three-month period, the decrease was primarily driven
by the decrease in gross margin and stock-based compensation expenses. For the nine-month period, the decrease was primarily driven by
the increase in SG A and stock-based compensation expenses partially offset by the increase in gross margin. 

Interest
expense increased by 0.1 million and 1.9 million respectively for the three and nine-month period due to the termination of swaps,
the increase from foreign exchange movements on bank accounts and foreign exchange impacts on debt retranslation 

Profit
on disposal of trade and assets had no change in the three-month period and a 0.9 million decrease for the nine-month period as the
prior year period included the sale of Italian trading assets. 

Other
finance income decreased 0.2 million and 0.5 million respectively for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. 

Income
tax expense increased by 1.9 million and 2.5 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The
increase in the three and nine-month periods includes the impact of US losses brought forward not being sufficient to offset the 2023
taxable profits. 

For
the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2023, net income was 3.4 million and 7.6 million, respectively, compared to net income
of 9.2 million and 17.1 million, respectively, in the prior year period. For the three-month period, the decrease was primarily driven
by the decrease in net operating income as well as the increase in income tax expense. For the nine-month period, the decrease was primarily
driven by the decrease in net operating income as well as the increases in interest expense and income tax expense and the decreases
in profit on disposal of trade and assets and other finance income. 

28 

Segment
Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022) 

Gaming 

We
generate revenue from our Gaming segment through the delivery of our gaming terminals preloaded with propriety gaming software, server
based content, as well as services such as terminal repairs, maintenance, software updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis
and content development. We receive rental fees for machines, typically in conjunction with long-term contracts, on both a participation
and fixed fee basis. Our participation contracts are typically structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to
our operator customers, after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays and any relevant regulatory levies) from gaming terminals
placed in our customers facilities. Typically, we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of
the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Gaming business is principally driven by changes in (i) the number of operator customers we have, (ii) the number of Gaming
machines in operation, (iii) the net win performance of the machines and (iv) the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our
contracts with our customers.

(1) 
 Includes
 all SBG terminals in which the Company takes a participation revenue share across all territories. 

(2)
 
 Includes
 circa 2,500 of lottery terminals where the share is on handle instead of net win. 

In
the table above: 

End
of Period Installed Base is equal to the number of deployed Gaming terminals at the end of each period that have been placed on
a participation or fixed rental basis. Gaming participation revenue, which comprises the majority of Gaming Service revenue, is directly
related to the participation terminal installed base. This is the medium by which our customers generate revenue and distribute a revenue
share to the Company. To the extent all other KPIs and certain other factors remain constant, the larger the installed base, the higher
the Company s revenue would be for a given period. Management gives careful consideration to this KPI in terms of driving growth
across the segment. This does not include Service Only terminals. 

29 

Revenue
is derived from the performance of the installed base as described by the Gross and Net Win KPIs. 

If
the End of Period Installed Base is materially different from the Average Installed Base (described below), we believe this gives an
indication as to potential future performance. We believe the End of Period Installed Base is particularly useful for assessing new customers
or markets, to indicate the progress being made with respect to entering new territories or jurisdictions. 

Total
Gaming - Average Installed Base is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals during the period split by Participation terminals
and Fixed Rental terminals. Therefore, it is more closely aligned to revenue in the period. We believe this measure is particularly useful
for assessing existing customers or markets to provide comparisons of historical size and performance. This does not include Service
Only terminals. 

Participation
- Average Installed Base is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals that generated revenue on a participation basis. 

Fixed
Rental - Average Installed Base is the average number of deployed Gaming terminals that generated revenue on a fixed rental basis. 

Service
Only - Average Installed Base is the average number of terminals that generated revenue on a Service only basis. 

Customer
Gross Win per unit per day is a KPI used by our management to (i) assess impact on the Company s revenue, (ii) determine
changes in the performance of the overall market and (iii) evaluate the impacts of regulatory change and our new content releases on
our customers. Customer Gross Win per unit per day is the average per unit cash generated across all Gaming terminals in which the Company
takes a participation revenue share across all territories in the period, defined as the difference between the amounts staked less winnings
to players divided by the Average Installed Base in the period, then divided by the number of days in the period. 

Gaming
revenue accrued in the period is derived from Customer Gross Win accrued in the period after deducting gaming taxes (defined as a regulatory
levy paid by the Customer to government bodies) and applying the Company s contractual revenue share percentage. 

Management
believes Customer Gross Win measures are meaningful because they represent a view of customer operating performance that is unaffected
by our revenue share percentage and allow management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking
between customers and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different markets in which we operate. 

Customer
Net Win per unit per day is Customer Gross Win per unit per day after giving effect to the deduction of gaming taxes. 

Inspired
Blended Participation Rate is the Company s average revenue share percentage across all participation terminals where revenue
is earned on a participation basis, weighted by Customer Net Win per unit per day. 

Inspired
Fixed Rental Revenue per Gaming Machine per week is the Company s average fixed rental amount across all fixed rental terminals
where revenue is generated on a fixed fee basis, per unit per week. 

Inspired
Service Rental Revenue per Gaming Machine per week is the Company s average service rental amount across all service only
rental terminals where revenue is generated on a service only fixed fee basis, per unit per week. 

Gaming
Long term license amortization is the upfront license fee per terminal which is typically spread over the life of the terminal. 

30 

Our
overall Gaming revenue from terminals placed on a participation basis can therefore be calculated as the product of the Participation
- Average Installed Base, the Customer Net Win per unit per day, the number of days in the period, and the Inspired Blended Participation
Rate, which is equal to Participation Revenue . 

Number
of Machine sales is the number of terminals sold during the period. 

Average
selling price per terminal is the total revenue in GBP of the Gaming terminals sold divided by the number of Machine sales .

period ended September 30, 2022, includes 0.0 million and 0.8 million, respectively, of VAT-related revenue, which is not
reflected in Gaming Recurring Revenue for that period. Excluding VAT-related revenue, Gaming Recurring Revenue was 75 and 77 , respectively
of Total Gaming Revenue for such period. Total Gaming Revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 includes 18.0
million of Low Margin sales and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 includes 21.5 million of Low Margin sales. For
the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 there are no Low Margin sales. Excluding Low Margin sales, Gaming Recurring Revenue
was 84 of Total Gaming Revenue for the three-month period and 75 for the nine-month period. 

Note
 For the three and nine-months ending September 30, 2022, there has been some recharacterization between Gaming Participation
 Revenue and Other Fixed fee revenue to ensure consistency with similar items across the Group. 

In
the table above: 

Gaming
Participation Revenue includes our share of revenue generated from (i) our Gaming terminals placed in gaming and lottery venues;
and (ii) licensing of our game content and intellectual property to third parties. 

Gaming
Other Fixed Fee Recurring Revenue includes service revenue in which the Company earns a periodic fixed fee on a contracted basis. 

Gaming
Project Recurring Revenue includes project revenue in which the Company earns a periodic revenue for project work on a contracted
basis. 

Gaming
Long term license amortization see the definition provided above.

Note:

changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Gaming
Revenue 

During
the three and nine-month period, Gaming revenue increased by 17.8 million and 29.6 million, respectively. This was driven by increases
in Product revenue of 19.2 million and 29.7 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases in Service revenue of 1.4 million
and 0.1 million, respectively. 

For
the three-month period the decrease in Gaming Service revenue was driven by lower revenue from UK LBO of 1.1 million as the prior year
period included a customer bonus not available in the current year period as well as lower revenue from Greece of 0.7 million driven
by the reduction of long-term license revenue due to the expiration of software licenses for terminals installed in 2018. This was partially
offset by increases of 0.5 million from the other non LBO UK markets. 

For
the nine-month period the decrease in Gaming Service revenue was mainly driven by lower revenue from Greece of 1.3 million, driven by
the reduction of long-term license revenue due to the expiration of software licenses for terminals installed in 2018 and the reduction
of VAT-related revenue of 1.0 million. This was partially offset by increases of 1.0 million from North America and 0.7 million from
the UK. 

For
the three-month period the increase in Gaming Product revenue was primarily driven by higher UK Product sales of 19.8 million, of which
 22.7 million were Low Margin sales. 

For
the nine-month period the increase in Gaming Product revenue was primarily driven by higher UK Product sales of 28.1 million, of which
 27.1 million were Low Margin sales. 

33 

Gaming
Operating Income / Net Income 

Net
income for the three and nine-month periods decreased by 1.4 million and 0.6 million respectively. 

The
three-month decrease was primarily due to lower gross margin as the 17.8 million revenue increase was offset by a 20.5 million increase
in total cost of sales (mainly driven by the increase in Low Margin sales in the current period) and higher service cost of sales predominately
from higher commissions costs as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization of 0.1 million partially offset by a decrease
in SG A expenses of 1.4 million. 

The
nine-month decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin of 1.7 million mainly due to the expiration of software licenses
for terminals installed in 2018 in Greece and the reduction of VAT-related revenue of 1.0 million, as well as a 0.9 million profit
from the disposal of trade and assets from the sale of part of the Italian VLT operations in the prior year. This was partially offset
by a decrease in SG A expenses of 1.4 million. 

Virtual
Sports 

We
generate revenue from our Virtual Sports segment through the on premise solution and hosting of our products. We primarily receive fees
on a participation basis. 

Our
participation contracts are typically structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator customers,
after deducting player winnings, free bets or plays and other promotional costs and any relevant regulatory levies) from Virtual Sports
content placed on our customers websites or in our customers facilities. Typically, we recognize revenue from these arrangements
on a daily basis over the term of the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Virtual Sports segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the net win performance of the games
and the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.

of any changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Virtual
Sports revenue 

During the three-month period revenue decreased by 2.0 million mainly
due to reductions in Online activity driven by a major customer s optimizing of their customer base, with a partial offset due to
increased Retail revenue. During the nine-month period, revenue increased by 4.1 million driven by Online Virtuals, primarily driven by the growth of our existing
online customers along with expanding jurisdictions, as well as increases in Retail Virtuals. 

Virtual
Sports operating income 

During
the three-month period net operating income decreased by 1.4 million driven by the decrease in revenue partially offset by reductions
in SG A and depreciation and amortization expenses. 

During
the nine-month period net operating income increased by 4.6 million driven by the increase in gross margin and decrease in SG A
expenses, partially offset by increases in stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Interactive 

We
generate revenue from our Interactive segment through the various games content made available via third party aggregation platforms
with Inspired s remote gaming server or directly on the Company s remote gaming server platform, and services such as customer
support, platform maintenance, updates and upgrades. Typically, we receive fees on a participation basis. Our participation contracts
are usually structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator customers, after deducting player winnings,
free bets or plays and other promotional costs and any relevant regulatory levies) from Interactive content placed on our customers 
websites. Typically, we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Interactive segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the number of live games, the net win performance
of the games and the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.

Interactive
revenue 

During
three and nine-month period, revenue increased by 1.5 million and 4.8 million, respectively, primarily driven by revenue growth in
the UK, US and Canada due to new customer launches, the consistent launch of new content across the estate and increased promotional
activity through exclusive deals with tier-one customers. 

Interactive
operating income 

Operating
income for the three-month period increased by 1.0 million and the nine-month period increased by 1.6 million,
respectively. The nine-month increase was driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by increases in SG A expenses 1.8
million, respectively, due to an increase in staff costs due to an investment in new technology and commercial headcount during Q4
2022 and Q1 2023. 

38 

Leisure 

We
typically generate revenue from our Leisure segment through the supply of our gaming and amusement machines. We receive rental fees for
machines, typically on a long-term contract basis, on both a participation and fixed fee basis. Our participation contracts are usually
structured to pay us a percentage of net win (defined as net revenue to our operator customers, after deducting player winnings, free
bets or plays, any relevant regulatory levies and minimum fixed incomes where applicable) from machines placed in our customers 
facilities. We generally recognize revenue from these arrangements on a daily basis over the term of the contract. 

Revenue
growth for our Leisure segment is principally driven by the number of customers we have, the number of machines in operation, the net
win performance of the machines and the net win percentage that we receive pursuant to our contracts with our customers.

All
variances discussed in the Leisure results below are on a functional currency (at constant rate) basis, which excludes the impact of
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Leisure
Revenue 

For
the three-month and nine-month period revenue decreased by 0.9 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The decrease in the three and
nine-month periods was primarily due to the structured withdrawal of non-core low-margin amusement and prize vend machines as recognized
in the third quarter of 2022 in the Pubs sector as well as the reduction in the number of analog gaming machines, partially offset by
increases in Holiday Parks due to the addition of new locations. 

Leisure
Operating Income/ (Loss) 

Operating
income for the three and nine-month periods decreased by 1.1 million and 3.5 million, respectively. This was primarily
due to the increase in SG A expenses of 0.5 million and 2.0 million, respectively, driven by the increase in national living wage
and salary increases. This was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 0.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively,
due to the decrease in machine depreciation as assets become fully depreciated. 

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures 

We
use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to analyze our operating performance. We use these financial
measures to manage our business on a day-to-day basis. We believe that these measures are also commonly used in our industry to measure
performance. For these reasons, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide expanded insight into our business, in addition
to standard U.S. GAAP financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for defining and using non-GAAP financial measures,
and as a result the measures we use may not be comparable to measures used by other companies, even if they have similar labels. The
presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial
information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. You should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with
our U.S. GAAP financial measures. 

We
define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows: 

EBITDA
 is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income
tax expense, and other additional exclusions and adjustments (see Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table) . Such additional excluded amounts include stock-based
compensation U.S. GAAP charges where the associated liability is expected to be settled in stock, and changes in the value of
earnout liabilities and income and expenditure in relation to legacy portions of the business (being those portions where trading no
longer occurs) including closed defined benefit pension schemes. Additional adjustments are made for items considered outside the
normal course of business, including but not limited to (1) restructuring costs, which include charges attributable to employee
severance, management changes, restructuring, dual running costs, costs related to facility closures and integration costs, (2)
merger and acquisition costs and (3) gains or losses not in the ordinary course of business. 

We
believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a particularly useful performance measure, because
it focuses on certain operating drivers of the business, including sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense
and other operating income and expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can provide a more complete understanding of our operating results
and the trends to which we are subject, and an enhanced overall understanding of our financial performance and prospects for the future.
Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income or loss,
because it does not take into account certain aspects of our operating performance (for example, it excludes non-recurring gains and
losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of underlying business activities) . Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable
to the use by other companies of similarly termed measures. Management compensates for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA as
only one of several measures for evaluating our operating performance. In addition, capital expenditures, which affect depreciation and
amortization, interest expense, and income tax benefit (expense), are evaluated separately by management. 

41 

Adjusted
Revenue (Revenue Excluding Low Margin Gaming Hardware Sales) is defined as revenue excluding Gaming hardware sales that are sold
at Low Margin with the intention of securing longer term recurring revenue streams. 

Functional
Currency at Constant rate. Currency impacts discussed have been calculated as the current-period average GBP: USD rate less the
equivalent average rate in the prior year period, multiplied by the current period amount in our functional currency (GBP). The remaining
difference, referred to as functional currency at constant rate, is calculated as the difference in our functional currency, multiplied
by the prior-period average GBP: USD rate, as a proxy for functional currency at constant rate movement. 

Currency
Movement represents the difference between the results in our reporting currency (USD) and the results on a functional currency
(at constant rate) basis. 

Reconciliations
from net loss, as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), to Adjusted EBITDA are shown below.

Notes
to Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation tables above: 

(1) 
 Pension
 charges are profit and loss charges included within selling, general and administrative expenses, relating to a defined benefit
 scheme which was closed to new entrants in 1999 and to future accrual in 2010. As well as the amortization of net loss, the figure
 also includes charges relating to the Pension Protection Fund (which were historically borne by the pension scheme) and a small amount
 of associated professional services expenses. These costs are included within Corporate Functions. 

(2) 
 Acquisition
 and integration related transaction expenses, are as described above in the Results of Operations line item discussions. 

(3) 
 Costs
 of group restructure include redundancy costs, Payments In Lieu of Notice costs and any associated employer taxes. To qualify
 as being an adjusting item, costs must be part of a large restructuring project, which will net save ongoing future costs or be in
 relation to the exit of an Executive. 

(4) 
 Stock-based
 compensation expense, Depreciation and amortization, Total other expense, net and Income tax are as described above in the Results
 of Operations line item discussions. Total expense, net includes interest income, interest expense, change in fair value of earnout
 liability, change in fair value of derivative liability and other finance income. 

(5) 
 Exchange
 rate in the table is calculated by dividing the USD Adjusted EBITDA by the GBP Adjusted EBITDA, therefore this could be slightly
 different from the average rate during the period depending on timing of transactions. 

(6) 
 Profit
 on disposal of trade assets In January 2022, the Company sold its Italian VLT business, including all terminals
 and other assets, staff costs and facilities and contracts to a non-connected party, recognizing a profit on this disposal.

Reconciliation
to Adjusted Revenue 

We
believe that accounting for Low Margin hardware sales in conformance with U.S. GAAP can result in a distorted presentation of our revenue
and growth. Therefore, we use Revenue Excluding Low Margin Sales, or Adjusted Revenue, to internally analyze our operating performance.
A reconciliation from revenue, as shown in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss included elsewhere in this
report, to Adjusted Revenue is shown below.

Net
cash provided by operating activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash inflow provided by operating activities was 35.3 million, compared to a 31.8 million
inflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, representing a 3.5 million increase in cash generation from operating activities. 

Depreciation
and amortization decreased by 0.2 million, to 32.6 million, with a 1.9 million reduction in machine depreciation offset by a 1.7
million increase in software development amortization. 

Contract
cost additions increased by 3.0 million to 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2022. 

Other
net cash utilized by operating activities improved by 14.0 million, to an 8.0 million outflow. The relative movements between the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2022 resulted in favorable movements in deferred revenue 5.8
million due to invoice timing and the Low Margin Vantage machine rollout, accounts receivable 13.0 million as a result of the timing
of machine hardware sales the levels of which fluctuate during the year and a 2.7 million smaller inventory increase. These are partly
offset by a 7.1 million reduction in accounts payable, accruals and taxes and a 1.9 million rise in prepayments. 

44 

Net
cash used in investing activities 

Net
cash utilized in investing activities increased by 6.2 million, to 31.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This
was driven by a 1.7 million increase in capitalized software spend and a 3.3 million increase in spend on gaming machines in Greece
for which the company receives an upfront contribution benefitting cash utilized by operating activities. The nine months ended September
30, 2022 also included 1.3 million relating to the sale of the gaming business. 

Net
cash used by financing activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used by financing activities was 2.6 million, with 1.0 million of finance lease
spend and 1.6 million on share repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net cash utilized by financing activities
was 10.5 million consisting of finance lease spend of 0.5 million and share repurchases of 10.0 million. 

Funding
Needs and Sources 

To
fund our obligations, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations and the incurrence of additional
debt or the refinancing of existing debt. As of September 30, 2023, we had liquidity consisting of 26.4 million in cash and cash equivalents
and a further 24.4 million of undrawn revolver facility. This compares to 37.4 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September
30, 2022, with a further 22.3 million of revolver facilities undrawn. We had a working capital outflow of 8.0 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a 22.0 million outflow for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

The
level of our working capital surplus or deficit varies with the level of machine production being undertaken and our capitalization as
well as the seasonality evident in some of the businesses. In periods with minimal machine volumes and capital spend, our working capital
is typically more stable. In periods where significant numbers of machines are being produced, the levels of inventory and creditors
are typically higher and there is a natural timing difference between converting the stock into sellable or capitalized plant and settling
payments to suppliers. These factors, along with movements in trading activity levels can result in significant working capital volatility.
In periods of low activity, our working capital volatility is reduced. Working capital is reviewed and managed with the aim of ensuring
that current liabilities are covered by the level of cash held and the expected level of short-term receipts. 

Some
of our business operations require cash to be held within the machines. As of September 30, 2023, 6.0 million of our 26.4 million of
cash and cash equivalents were held as operational floats within the machines. At September 30, 2022, 4.8 million of our 37.4 million
of cash and cash equivalents were held as operational floats within the machines 

Management
currently believes that the Company s cash balances on hand, cash flows expected to be generated from operations, and the ability
to control and defer capital projects will be sufficient to fund the Company s net cash requirements through November 2024.

Debt
Covenants 

Under
our debt facilities in place as of September 30, 2023, we are not subject to covenant testing on the Senior Secured Notes. We are, however,
subject to covenant testing at the level of Inspired Entertainment Inc., the ultimate holding company, on our Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility which requires the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio of 6.0x on March 31,
2022, stepping down to 5.75x on March 31, 2023 and 5.50x from March 31, 2024 and thereafter (the RCF Financial Covenant ).
The RCF Financial Covenant is calculated as the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (defined
as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income and income tax expense) for the 12-month period
preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the Initial Facility (as defined
in the RCF Agreement) being drawn on the relevant test date. The RCF Financial Covenant does not include a minimum interest coverage
ratio or other financial covenants. Covenant testing at September 30, 2023 showed covenant compliance with a net leverage of 2.7x. 

There
were no breaches of the debt covenants in the periods ended September 30, 2023 or September 30, 2022. 

45 

Liens
and Encumbrances 

As
of September 30, 2023, our senior bank debt was secured by the imposition of a fixed and floating charge in favor of the lender over
all the assets of the Company and certain of the Company s subsidiaries. 

Share
Repurchases 

The
Board of Directors has authorized that the Company may use up to 25.0 million to repurchase Inspired shares of common stock, subject
to repurchases being effected on or before May 10, 2025. Management has discretion as to whether to repurchase shares of the Company.
In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 1.6 million of shares were repurchased giving an aggregate spend of 12.0 million in repurchasing
our shares of common stock.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We exercise considerable judgment with respect
to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and
liabilities, our recognition of revenue and expenses, and our disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated
financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on a variety
of factors, including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry and current and expected economic conditions,
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions
with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary. While we believe
that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee
that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results
could differ from such estimates. 

For
a discussion of other recently issued accounting standards, and assessments as to their impacts on the Company, see Note 1 Nature
of Operations, Management s Plans and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10K/A as of December 31, 2022
and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

Revenue 

Application
of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements
with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. The Company
often enters into contracts with customers that consist of a combination of services and products that are accounted for as one or more
distinct performance obligations. Management applies judgment in evaluating the contractual terms and conditions that impact the identification
of performance obligations and the pattern of revenue recognition. For these arrangements that contain multiple promises, judgement is
also required to determine the stand-alone selling price SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where
SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information
that may include market conditions, size of the customer, geography and other observable inputs or, as necessary, unobservable considerations
such as historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry and our current or expected selling practices. 

46 

Revenue
recognition is also impacted by our ability to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, service-level penalties,
and other incentive payments. We consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical
experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. 

Other
significant judgments include determining whether the Company is acting as the principal or the agent in a transaction. 

The
Company recognized service and product revenues of 248.4 million and 33.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31,2022.
The Company s revenue recognition policy, which requires significant judgments and estimates, is fully described in Note 1 Nature
of Operations, Management s Plans and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the
year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

Goodwill
Impairment Assessment 

In
accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected
to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on at least an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill
upon reorganization using a relative fair value allocation approach. We determined that we have five reporting units: Virtual Sports,
Interactive, Leisure, and two reporting units within our Gaming segment. As of December 31, 2022, total goodwill with the Virtual Sports,
Leisure, and two Gaming reporting units is 42.3 million, 1.7 million, 8.8 million, and 2.8 million, respectively. There is no remaining
goodwill within the Leisure reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level
below an operating segment) annually on the last day of our fiscal period or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances
could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or
disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. 

Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative one-step process. If we perform a qualitative assessment
and determine that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.
For reporting units where we perform the quantitative test, we are required to compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we
primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows and a market approach, to the respective
carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered
impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the reporting unit s estimated fair value. 

Application
of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities
to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. Performance
of the qualitative goodwill assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events
and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of the reporting units. Such events and circumstances that we have considered
include macroeconomic conditions, industry specific and market considerations, and reporting unit-specific factors such as overall actual
and projected financial performance, among other factors. We also considered the results from the most recent date that a fair value
measurement was performed as a part of a quantitative goodwill assessment and specifically the cushion between each reporting unit s
fair value and carrying value. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit as a part of a quantitative goodwill
assessment change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and
assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment, if any, for each reporting unit. 

47 

We
performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 using a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting
units. The qualitative analyses evaluated factors, including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors
and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. Based on the results of our qualitative impairment assessments, we concluded
that it is more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying
values and there were no reporting units requiring further assessment. 

During
the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and all venues offering land-based gaming, including our products, were
closed for an indeterminate period of time in the jurisdictions in which we operate through governmental mandate, the Company concluded
these triggering events could indicate possible impairment of its goodwill in the Server Based Gaming SBG and Acquired
Businesses ACB reporting units. The Company performed a quantitative and qualitative impairment analysis and determined
that goodwill within the Acquired Businesses reporting unit was fully impaired. The Company performed an income approach on all reporting
units in order to reconcile the fair values of the aggregate reporting units to the Company s market capitalization, implying a
control premium ranging from 10.6 on a total invested capital basis (30 day prior average) to 18.5 on a total invested capital basis
(as of March 31, 2020). The Virtual Sports and Interactive reporting units had headroom significantly in excess of 100 , and no triggering
event occurred for these businesses. For the remaining two reporting units, there were triggering events and significant assumptions
existed in the impairment analyses. For the Server Based Gaming reporting unit, the headroom was 15 and therefore no impairment existed.
For the Acquired Businesses reporting unit, there was no headroom and a full impairment of 20.7M was recorded in the consolidated statement
of earnings (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pre-tax basis. 

Significant
assumptions utilized in the impairment analyses for SPG were : projected revenue, EBITDA margin, and discount
rate. Projected revenue based on a 6-year CAGR was .2 for SBG. A 1.0 decrease in the annual projected revenue growth rate would have
resulted in a reduction in headroom for SBG to 7.2 . A 1.0 decline in the projected EBITDA margin would have resulted in a reduction
in headroom for SBG to 4.4 . The discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses were 13.5 and a resulting . A 
1.0 increase in the discount rate for SBG would have resulted in an impairment implying a 1.0 Fair Value deficit to SBG s carrying
value. An increase in revenue or EBITDA margin growth or an decrease in discount rate would have increased the headroom in SPG. Management
utilized their best estimates in the SPG analysis, 

Significant
assumptions utilized in the analysis for ACB were: projected revenue, EBITDA margin, and discount rate. Projected revenue for ACB based
on a 6-year CAGR and was 2.9 for ACB , respectively . A 1.0 increase in the annual projected revenue
growth (resulting in a 6-year CAGR of 3.7 would have resulted in a 9.7 decline in the goodwill impairment recorded for ACB. A 1.0 
increase in the projected EBITDA margin would have resulted in a 22.8 decline in the goodwill impairment recorded for ACB. The discount
rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analyses were 16.5 . A 1.0 decrease in the discount rate for ACB would have resulted in a
9.7 decline in the goodwill impairment recorded to ACB. Given the full impairment of ACB, a decrease in revenue or EBITDA margin growth
or an increase in discount rate would have no change in the level of goodwill impairment taken. Management utilized their best estimates
in the ACB analysis, 

Information
regarding our 2020 impairment analyses can be found under the caption Note 8 Intangible Assets and Goodwill in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10K/A as of December 31, 2022
and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

Long-lived
Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets 

We
evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives by comparing the carrying value
of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that we expect the asset to generate if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that these assets are not recoverable. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, an impairment loss is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow
approach where projections of future cash flows generated by those assets are discounted using an estimated discount rate. Significant
judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also
make judgments about the remaining useful lives of intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. While we believe
our estimates of future operating results and projected cash flows are reasonable, any significant adverse changes in key assumptions
(i.e., adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or expectation that, more likely than not,
an asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its useful life) or adverse changes in economic and market
conditions may cause a change in our evaluation of recoverability or our estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge
that could be material to our financial statements. Any impairment loss shall be allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a
pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset
of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. 

48 

During
the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and all venues offering land-based gaming, including our products, were
closed for an indeterminate period of time in the jurisdictions in which we operate through governmental mandate, the Company concluded
these triggering events could indicate possible impairment of its long-lived tangible and intangible assets in the Server Based Gaming
and Acquired Businesses reporting units. The Company performed a quantitative and qualitative impairment analysis and determined that
all its asset groups within Server Based Gaming and Acquired businesses had a triggering event. As a result, the Company performed a
recoverability test and determined all asset groups were recoverable under the undiscounted cash flow recoverability test other than
Playnation, for which the intangible assets were fully impaired but tangible long-lived assets had no impairments. While evaluating the
significance of and sensitizing various assumptions, Management determined that there were no individual assumptions that, within a reasonable
range, would have altered the asset group impairment results. As such, step 2 was performed and resulted in a 1.3 million and 0.5 million
impairment for customer relationships and trademarks intangible assets, respectively, on a pre-tax basis and the Company recorded the
total impacts of the impairments on its consolidated statement of earnings (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management determined
that there were no new indicators of impairment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the Company concluded that there was
no impairment of the Company s intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Software
Development Costs 

Software
development costs represent costs incurred to develop internal-use software, including software developed to deliver our cloud-based
offerings to customers, as well as external-use software to be used in the products we sell, lease or license to customers. Such costs
primarily consist of salaries and payroll related costs for employees and external contractors directly involved in the corresponding
software development efforts. We determine the appropriate guidance to apply to software development costs on a project-by-project basis,
based on the nature of the underlying software. 

Certain
direct costs incurred to develop new internal-use software, as well as certain software enhancements that provide new functionality,
are capitalized once the project has been approved by management and is in the application development stage. Costs incurred in the preliminary
planning stage and the post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. 

Costs
incurred in developing external-use software are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, after which
costs are capitalized up to the date the software is available for general release to customers. Technological feasibility is established
upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, upon completion of a working model. 

The
Company must apply judgement in determining the amount of software development costs that should be capitalized. Specifically, we must
evaluate, on a project by project basis, whether the resultant product or platform will be completed and generate ongoing economic benefits,
principally through revenue from our customers, which is subject to uncertainties. 

Once
the software is substantially complete or available for general release, capitalized internal-use and external-use software costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful life of the software, which ranges from two to five years. There
is judgement involved in estimating the useful life of developed software and the two-to-five-year period was determined based on factors
such as the continuous development in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades.
Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a recurring basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 

Information
regarding our 2020 impairment analyses can be found under the caption Note 8 Intangible Assets and Goodwill in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10K/A as of December 31, 2022
and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our
principal market risks are our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Interest
Rate Risk 

Following
the Company s refinancing of its debt in May 2021, the external borrowings of 235.0 million 286.9 million) are provided
at a fixed rate. Therefore, movements in rates such as LIBOR do not impact on the current borrowings and the only fluctuation that is
expected to be reported will be that solely caused by movements in the exchange rates between the Company s functional currency
and its reporting currency. 

49 

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

Our
operations are conducted in various countries around the world, and we receive revenue and pay expenses from these operations in a number
of different currencies. As such, our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated
in (i) currencies other than GBP, which is our functional currency, or (ii) the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, which is not
necessarily GBP. To estimate our foreign currency exchange rate risk, we identify material Euro and US Dollar trading and balance sheet
amounts and recalculate the result using a 10 movement in the GBP:US Dollar exchange rate. For the trading figures the 10 movement
is based on the average exchange rate throughout the reported period and for the balance sheet figures the 10 movement is based on the
exchange rate used at September 30, 2023. 

Excluding
intercompany balances, our Euro functional currency net assets total approximately 20.3 million, and our US Dollar functional currency
net liabilities total approximately 0.7 million. We use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of a 10 adverse movement
of foreign currency exchange rates against the US Dollar. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the Euro and the US Dollar
relative to GBP as of September 30, 2023, would result in translation adjustments of approximately 1.9 million favorable and 0.1 million
unfavorable, respectively, recorded in other comprehensive loss. 

Included
within our trading results are earnings outside of our functional currency. Retained gains from Euro based entities earned in Euros and
retained losses from USD based entities earned in US Dollars in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 7.6 million and
 14.9 million, respectively. A hypothetical 10 adverse change in the value of the Euro and the US Dollar relative to GBP as of September
30, 2023, would result in translation adjustments of approximately 0.7 million favorable and 1.4 million unfavorable, respectively,
recorded in trading operations. 

The
majority of the Company s trading is in GBP, the functional currency, although the reporting currency of the Company is the US
Dollar. As such, changes in the GBP:USD exchange rate have an effect on the Company s results. A 10 weakening of GBP against the
US Dollar would change the trading operational results unfavorably by approximately 1.2 million and would result in unfavorable translation
adjustments of approximately 8.9 million, recorded in other comprehensive loss. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

 Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing,
our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as
of September 30, 2023, due to the material weaknesses described in Item 9A of the Company s restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. Management is redesigning and implementing existing and
additional controls to remediate these material weaknesses Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses and management s
assessment that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2023,
management believes that the interim consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q/A fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures as of
and for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the control changes to remediate the identified material weaknesses, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that,
currently, we have no such matters that are material, there can be no assurance that existing or new matters arising in the ordinary
course of business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our
business is subject to a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. You should carefully read and assess all of these risk factors. Any of these risks could
materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, and cause the value of our common
stock to decline, which could cause investors in our common stock to lose all or part of their investments. The risk factor set forth
below supplements and updates the risk factors previously disclosed and should be read together with the risk factors described in our
Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and with any risk factors we may include in subsequent periodic filings with
the SEC. 

Our
restatement of certain of our previously issued financial statements may impose unanticipated costs, affect investor confidence, and
cause reputational harm. 

As
discussed in the Explanatory Note and in Note 2 of our Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have filed our
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A which amends the original filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K to restate the audited consolidated financial
statements as of and for 2021 and 2022 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and associated reports of the Company s independent
registered public accounting firm as well as the Company s previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
during those years, as well as for the first and second quarters of 2023 included in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
(the Subject Periods contained the accounting errors relating to the compliance with U.S. GAAP in connection with the
Company s accounting policies for capitalizing software development costs. As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur,
unanticipated costs in connection with or related to the investigation and restatement, as well as any litigation or regulatory inquiries
that may result therefrom. In addition, the investigation, restatement, and related media coverage may negatively affect investor confidence
in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and cause us reputational harm.
