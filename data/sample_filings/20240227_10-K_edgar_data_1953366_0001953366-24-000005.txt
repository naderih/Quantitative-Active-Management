Business Explanatory Note for Purposes of the "Safe Harbor Provisions" of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements are included with respect to, among other things, Star Holdings we, our and/or the Company current business strategy, portfolio management, prospects and liquidity. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believe," "project," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "strategy," "plan," "may," "should," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that the Company believes might cause such differences are discussed in the section entitled, "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K or otherwise accompany the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In assessing all forward-looking statements, readers are urged to read carefully all cautionary statements contained in this Form 10-K. Company Background Star Holdings was formed to succeed to the legacy non-ground lease real estate assets of iStar Inc. iStar ). On March 31, 2023, iStar completed its transition to a ground lease focused business through the merger of iStar and Safehold Inc., a ground lease company previously founded by iStar (the Merger ). iStar continued as the surviving corporation in the Merger and changed its name to Safehold Inc. Safe ). Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, iStar completed a series of reorganization and separation transactions (collectively, the Spin-Off in accordance with the terms of a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the Separation and Distribution Agreement ), dated as of March 31, 2023, by and between iStar and us. To effectuate the Spin-Off: (i) iStar contributed its remaining legacy non-ground lease assets, 13,522,651 shares of common stock of Safehold Inc. previously owned by iStar (the "Safe Shares") and certain other assets to us; and (ii) iStar distributed 100 of our common shares of beneficial interest to holders of common stock of iStar by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of the Company for each outstanding share of iStar common stock held on the record date of the distribution. Following the Spin-Off, we became an independent, publicly traded company. Our common shares commenced regular-way trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (the Nasdaq under the symbol STHO on March 31, 2023. We are externally managed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Safe (the Manager ). In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement, a management agreement with the Manager (the "Management Agreement"), a governance agreement with Safe (the "Governance Agreement") and a registration rights agreement with Safe (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). We also entered into a credit facility with Safe (the "Safe Credit Facility") and a margin loan facility with a third-party lender (the "Margin Loan Facility"). The Company operates its business as one segment that focuses on realizing value for shareholders primarily by generating cash flows through active asset management and sales of its existing loans, operating properties and land and development properties.

Table of Contents 
 Company Portfolio At the time of the Spin-Off, our real estate portfolio was comprised of legacy assets from iStar s historical real estate finance, operating properties and land and development businesses and the Safe Shares. Since the date of the Spin-Off, certain of the legacy real estate assets have been sold or repaid. Additional information on our portfolio as of December 31, 2023 is set forth below. Our Development Portfolio Asbury Park Waterfront We are the managing member in Asbury Partners, LLC, which is the joint venture that owns the Asbury Park Waterfront investment. The aggregate carrying value of the Asbury Park Waterfront investment was approximately 140.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Asbury Park Waterfront investment includes the following: Asbury Ocean Club Surfside Resort and Residences: a 16-story mixed use project featuring 130 residential condominium units, a 54-key luxury boutique hotel, 24,000 square feet of retail space, 410 structured parking spaces and a 15,000 square foot gym and spa amenity area. The property was completed in 2019. The hotel is managed by a third party. As of December 31, 2023, two residential condominium units remain unsold. The Asbury: a 110-key independent boutique hotel with indoor and outdoor event spaces, and a rooftop bar. The hotel was completed in 2016 and is managed by a third party. Asbury Lanes: a 12,000 square foot music and entertainment venue. The venue was completed in 2018, connected to The Asbury, and is managed by a third party. 
 Our current strategy for the Asbury Park Waterfront investment is to sell the two remaining residential condominium units at Asbury Ocean Club, actively asset manage our operating assets, strategically monetize the remaining development sites and our operating assets through sales to third party developers and operators while meeting our obligations under the redevelopment agreement with the city of Asbury Park. Magnolia Green Magnolia Green is an approximately 1,900 acre multi-generational master planned residential community that is entitled for 3,550 single and multifamily dwelling units and approximately 193 acres of land for commercial development. The community is located 19 miles southwest of Richmond, Virginia and offers distinct phases designed for people in different life stages, from first home buyers to empty nesters in single family and townhomes built by the area s top homebuilders. The project is anchored by the Magnolia Green Golf Club, a semi-private 18-hole Nicklaus Design championship golf course with full-service clubhouse and driving range. There are also numerous community amenities, including the Aquatic Center, featuring multiple pools and a snack bar, Arbor Walk, featuring a junior Olympic competition pool, water slide and sports courts, the Tennis Center, featuring tennis and pickleball courts and a pro shop, and miles of paved trails. The aggregate carrying value of our Magnolia Green assets as of December 31, 2023 was 65.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, 1,975 residential lots have been sold to homebuilders. We anticipate selling our remaining residential lots to homebuilders either upon completion of horizontal lot development or in bulk as unimproved lots over the next three years and it could take substantially longer. We anticipate selling the golf course operations to a third party upon completion of residential lot sellout. There can be no assurance, however, that these sales will be completed. Our Monetizing Portfolio As of December 31 , 2023, we owned assets that we expect to monetize primarily through asset sales, loan repayments or active asset management. These assets had an aggregate carrying value of approximately 71.1 million 
 2 

Table of Contents 
 and were comprised primarily of loans, operating properties, land and other assets. Summarized information regarding these assets is set forth below. Loans and other lending investments . The loans and other lending investments included in our monetizing portfolio as of December 31 , 2023 include two loans with an aggregate carrying value of 16.3 million and two available-for-sale debt securities with an aggregate carrying value of 4.6 million. Land . The land assets included in our portfolio as of December 31 , 2023 include two assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately 35.2 million. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the land assets to third party developers. In addition, we have another land asset related to a venture at Asbury Park with a carrying value of 11.4 million (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Other . The remainder of the monetizing assets primarily consist of two short term leases that we have subleased to third parties, which had an aggregate carrying value of 3.6 million as of December 31 , 2023, and a group of loans and equity interests that are recorded as having no carrying value in our financial statements. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the leased assets, although we may hold one or both leases until they expire. For the assets with no carrying value, we may seek to sell these assets but can give no assurance that we will recover any value from them. Investment in Safe . In addition to the assets described above, we also own the Safe Shares which had a fair value of 316.4 million based on the closing price of 23.40 as of December 29 , 2023. The Safe Shares collateralize our Margin Loan Facility and the net proceeds from the sale of any Safe Shares must be applied first to repay the Margin Loan Facility. Our Governance Agreement with Safe prohibited us from transferring any Safe Shares for nine months following the closing of the Merger, except as required under the terms of the Margin Loan Facility. That nine-month period expired on December 31, 2023. In the second half of 2023, we took certain steps intended to address declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. We paid down the outstanding balance of the Margin Loan Facility to 81.9 million as of December 31 , 2023. We also entered into amendments to the Margin Loan Facility and the Safe Credit Facility to, among other things, reduce the floor price of the Safe Shares that would trigger a mandatory prepayment in full of the Margin Loan Facility and enable us to access incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility to replenish funds used to voluntarily prepay the Margin Loan Facility. Further declines in the market value of the Safe Shares could require us to make additional prepayments of some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility. Accessing incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility will increase our interest expense because the interest rate on all borrowings increases to 10.0 per annum while incremental borrowings remain outstanding. Investment Strategy We expect to focus on realizing value for shareholders primarily by maximizing cash flows through active asset management and asset sales. We expect to make certain investments to complete development at Asbury and Magnolia Green, but we do not otherwise currently expect to make material new investments or acquire material new assets. Financing Strategy As of December 31, 2023 our principal financing sources are the Safe Credit Facility and the Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). While we do not currently expect to incur material new indebtedness, our governing documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur and we may consider future refinancing and new financing opportunities, depending upon our liquidity and capital needs, the availability and costs of financing, economic conditions and other factors.

 Competition We face competition from numerous real estate and lodging companies and other owners of real properties, both private and public, in attracting guests to our hotel properties, buyers of our residential home sites and condominiums, tenants for our space available for lease and buyers of our assets. We compete with our competitors in terms of the quality of our assets, sale prices, rental rates, location, availability of alternative space and maintenance. Regulation General Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of the properties in our portfolio have the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. For more information, see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Properties and Business. Investment Company Act We intend to operate our business and manage our assets so that we will not be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. For more information, see Risk Factors The Loss of our Investment Company Act exemption would materially adversely affect us. Environmental Matters Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and former owners and operators of real estate are liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on such real estate. These laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect an owner s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership and operation of our properties, we may be potentially liable for such costs. The operations of current and former customers at our properties have involved, or may have involved, the use of hazardous materials or generated hazardous wastes. The release of such hazardous materials and wastes could result in the incurrence of liabilities to remediate any resulting contamination if the responsible party is unable or unwilling to do so. In addition, some of our properties are located in urban areas, and are therefore exposed to the risk of contamination originating from third-party sources. While a property owner may not be held responsible for remediating contamination that has migrated onsite from an offsite source, the contaminant s presence can have material adverse effects on our business, operations and the redevelopment of our properties. For more information, see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Properties and Business. Emerging Growth Company Status We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and, as such, are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to opt out of this extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required

Table of Contents 
 for all public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenue equals or exceeds 1.235 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the Spin-Off, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act. Code of Conduct The Company has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that sets forth the principles of conduct and ethics to be followed by our trustees, officers and asset level consultants (the "Code of Ethics"). The purpose of the Code of Ethics is to promote honest and ethical conduct, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure, compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in periodic reports, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Ethics and a culture of honesty and accountability. A copy of the Code of Ethics has been provided to each of our trustees, officers and asset level consultants, who are required to acknowledge that they have received and will comply with the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics is available on the Company s website at www.starholdingsco.com . The Company will disclose to shareholders material changes to its Code of Ethics, or any waivers for trustees or officers, if any, within four business days of any such event. As of December 31, 2023, there have been no amendments to the Code of Ethics and the Company has not granted any waivers from any provision of the Code of Ethics to any trustees or officers. Employees and Human Capital Resources We have no employees and primarily rely on our Manager for our human capital resources. Our Management Agreement requires that our Manager provide us with an executive management team and other appropriate support personnel to manage our business in accordance with the agreement. Our Manager is responsible for directly compensating and providing benefits to its employees who provide services to us. We reimburse our Manager for the salaries and other compensation of two accounting personnel who are fully dedicated to providing accounting services to us. Our Manager has advised us that it had 86 employees as of December 31, 2023, substantially all of whom are full time employees. We also rely on the personnel of a local property manager for certain services at our Asbury and Magnolia Green properties. Our Manager has reported that in its recruiting efforts, our Manager generally strives to have a diverse group of candidates to consider for roles. In addition, our Manager has reported that it maintains a variety of development, health and wellness and charitable programs for its personnel, including those who provide services to us.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in the Company s securities. Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to service our indebtedness, ability to pay distributions and the market price of the Company s common stock. The risks set forth below speak only as of the date of this report and the Company disclaims any duty to update them except as required by law. For purposes of these risk factors, the terms "our Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Star Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Risks Related to Our Properties and Business If global or local market and economic conditions deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Weak economic conditions generally or locally, sustained uncertainty about global or local economic conditions, inflation, rising and sustained higher interest rates, a tightening of credit markets, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, international hostilities and other similar factors could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower demand for homes, lower demand for lodging, lower rental rates, lower activity, lower availability of financing and declining values in our real estate portfolio, and make it more difficult to complete the development of our development properties and to sell our properties at attractive prices or at all. They may also adversely affect the market value of our Safe Shares. Additionally, these factors and conditions could have an impact on our customers, tenants, lenders and purchasers of our properties. No assurances can be given regarding such macroeconomic factors or conditions, and our ability to sell assets and generate cash flows from our properties may be negatively impacted, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our performance is subject to risks inherent in owning real estate investments. We are generally subject to risks related to the ownership of real estate. These risks include: changes in supply of or demand for properties in our market or sub-markets; higher interest rates that affect the cost and availability of mortgage financing and, in turn, demand for residential properties; competition for homebuyers, hotel guests, tenants and users and purchasers of properties in our market or sub-markets; the ongoing need for capital improvements at our significant development properties; increased operating costs, which may not necessarily be offset by increased revenues, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors; changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws; changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; inability of potential purchasers of our properties to obtain financing; competition from other assets in our markets or sub-markets and the quality of competition, such as the attractiveness of our properties as compared to other properties available for hotel stays, sale or rent based on considerations such as quality of property, convenience of location, rental rates, amenities and safety record; and civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, acts of God, including earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters (which may result in uninsured losses) and other factors beyond our control. Should any of the foregoing occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We will be materially dependent on sales of assets to generate cash flows. Our primary strategy is to generate cash flows and realize value through active asset management and asset sales. Asset sales are unpredictable and highly affected by economic conditions in the markets where the assets are located, the cost and availability of mortgage financing and competition from other properties available on the market. Our ability to sell Safe Shares will be affected by conditions in the capital markets and market prices of the shares. Our ability to sell assets may therefore be limited and could take longer than we anticipate. If we must sell an asset, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to dispose of the asset in the time period we desire or that the sales price of the asset will recoup or exceed our cost for the asset. If we are unable to sell assets at anticipated times or prices, we may not have sufficient cash to pay the management fee to our manager or repay our debt, we may be unable to pay distributions to our shareholders and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our portfolio is concentrated in certain assets and, as a result, any adverse changes impacting any of these assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Two of our assets, Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green, accounted for 74 of the carrying value of the legacy portfolio on a consolidated basis at December 31, 2023, and our Safe Shares are also a material asset. We would be materially and adversely affected by adverse developments at either of these properties or in the market price of Safe s common stock. The properties may experience adverse developments such as slowing business conditions, rising interest rates, material damage or delays in completion or increased competition. The value of our Safe Shares may be adversely affected by a slowdown in the growth of Safe s portfolio, declines in Safe s earnings growth, rising interest rates, declines in Safe s dividend rate and other adverse developments. The occurrence of any of these or other adverse developments could weaken our financial condition. The significance of these properties and our Safe Shares to our portfolio means that any adverse change in any of these assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If either of these properties or Safe suffers adverse business conditions, if either of them or our Safe Shares declines in value, if we experience material cost overruns in completing the development of either property or if we are unable to sell either property or our Safe Shares at an attractive price or at all, we could be materially and adversely affected. The residential market has experienced significant downturns that could recur and adversely affect us. Certain of our properties, including Magnolia Green and Asbury Park Waterfront, are residential development properties and we may make future direct or indirect investments in residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. The housing market in the United States has previously been affected by weakness in the economy, high unemployment levels, rising interest rates, inflation and low consumer confidence. Interest rates have been rising recently, resulting in increases in the costs of obtaining and refinancing a mortgage. It is possible another downturn could occur again in the near future and adversely impact our residential properties and the residential properties underlying investments we may make in the future, and accordingly our financial performance. Rising interest rates tend to negatively impact the residential mortgage market, which in turn may adversely affect the value of and demand for our land assets including our residential development projects, and the value of residential real estate-related investments we may make in the future. We may be unable to complete the development of our properties successfully, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations due to unexpected costs, delays and other contingencies. Our Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green assets are still under development and may take several years to complete. Development assets expose us to additional risks, including, without limitation: delays in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in completion delays and increased development costs;

 incurrence of development costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other costs, changes in development plans or unforeseen environmental conditions, which could make completion of the property more costly or uneconomical; abandonment of contemplated development projects or projects in which we have started development, and the failure to recover expenses and costs incurred through the time of abandonment which could result in significant expenses; risk of loss of periodic progress payments or advances to builders prior to completion; termination of leases by customers due to completion delays; failure to achieve expected occupancy levels, as the lease-up of space at our development projects may be slower than estimated; other risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed properties; costs to carry these assets and complete them, which requires additional liquidity and results in additional expenses that could exceed our original estimates and impact our operating results; costs overruns on development, which could be material; and uncertainty associated with rezoning, obtaining governmental permits and approvals, concerns of community associations, reliance on third party contractors, increasing commodity costs and threatened or pending litigation may materially delay our completion of rehabilitation and development activities and materially increase their cost to us. Demand for homes and apartment rentals may be adversely affected by a variety of macroeconomic factors beyond our control. Demand for homes and apartment rentals is dependent on a variety of macroeconomic factors, such as employment levels, interest rates, changes in stock market valuations, consumer confidence, housing demand, availability of mortgage financing, availability and prices of new homes compared to existing inventory, and demographic trends. Slowing residential demand would likely adversely affect, among other things, demand and pricing for lots at Magnolia Green and condominiums and apartment rentals at Asbury Park s multifamily assets. These factors affecting demand, in particular consumer confidence, can be significantly adversely affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. A downturn in the residential market could adversely affect our ability to sell our assets. The homebuilding industry has experienced periods of strength and weakness in recent years. The prior economic downturn in 2007-2010 severely affected demand for homes and pricing of homes for more than two years. In recent years, demand for homes has been affected by tightened monetary policy and increased mortgage rates. It is possible that an economic downturn resulting from concerns about a potential economic recession, rising interest rates, corporate layoffs, geopolitical instability, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors would result in a decline in demand for new homes and apartment rentals which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the risk of our manager losing key personnel, and we may be unable to retain key asset-level consultants. Safe personnel who are knowledgeable about our assets are employees of our manager or asset-level consultants to us. None of such individuals will be exclusively dedicated to us. Such individuals may depart and to the extent they are replaced their replacements will not have similar experience with, or knowledge of, our assets. Future sales of parcels at Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green will be subject to receipt of approvals from local municipalities. Certain future sales of additional development parcels at Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green will be subject to receipt of approvals from relevant local municipalities. The requirements we will need to fulfill to obtain such approvals are subject to change. We may not receive such approvals in a timely manner or at all.

 We may experience losses if the creditworthiness of our tenants deteriorates and they are unable to meet their lease obligations. We own or lease properties leased or subleased to tenants and receive rents from tenants during the contracted term of such leases. A tenant s ability to pay rent is determined by its creditworthiness, among other factors. If a tenant s credit deteriorates, the tenant may default on its obligations under our lease and may also become bankrupt. The bankruptcy or insolvency of our tenants or other failure to pay is likely to adversely affect the income produced by our real estate assets. If a tenant defaults, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. If a tenant files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to evict the tenant solely because of such bankruptcy or failure to pay. A court, however, may authorize a tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. In such a case, our claim against the tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. In addition, certain amounts paid to us within 90 days prior to the tenant s bankruptcy filing could be required to be returned to the tenant s bankruptcy estate. In any event, it is highly unlikely that a bankrupt or insolvent tenant would pay in full amounts it owes us under a lease that it intends to reject. In other circumstances, where a tenant s financial condition has become impaired, we may agree to partially or wholly terminate the lease in advance of the termination date in consideration for a lease termination fee that is likely less than the total contractual rental amount. Without regard to the manner in which the lease termination occurs, we are likely to incur additional costs in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions in our efforts to lease the space to a new tenant. In addition, the value of our properties may be negatively impacted and the proceeds from the sale of our properties may be reduced in the event of a deterioration in our tenants credit. In any of the foregoing circumstances, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Lease and sublease expirations, defaults and terminations may adversely affect our revenue. Lease and sublease expirations and terminations may result in reduced revenues if the rental payments received from replacement tenants are less than the rental payments received from the expiring or terminating tenants and subtenants. In addition, lease and sublease defaults or terminations by one or more significant tenants and subtenants or the failure of tenants and subtenants under expiring leases and subleases to elect to renew their leases and subleases could cause us to experience long periods of vacancy with no revenue from a facility and to incur substantial capital expenditures and/or concessions in order to obtain replacement tenants. Leases and subleases representing approximately 82 of our in-place operating lease income are scheduled to expire during the next five years. Our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if our revenues decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costs associated with our business, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs, are relatively inelastic and generally do not decrease, and may increase, when a property is not fully occupied, occupancy rates decrease, a customer fails to pay rent, or other costs, or other circumstances cause a reduction in property revenues. Additionally, the annual management fee we pay to our Manager is fixed for the initial four years of the Management Agreement. As a result, if revenues drop, we will not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our property taxes could increase due to a change in property tax rates or a reassessment, which could impact our cash flows. We are required to pay state and local taxes on our properties. The real property taxes on our properties may increase as property tax rates change or as our properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. Therefore, the amount of property taxes we pay in the future may increase substantially. If the property taxes we pay increase, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders could be adversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Some of our assets are held in joint ventures with third parties. Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by the capital markets, lack of sole decision-making authority, changes in priorities or approvals by government agencies, reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners. We co-invest with third parties in certain of our assets, including the Asbury Park Waterfront assets. Some of these investments are noncontrolling interests, and in others we share responsibility for managing the affairs of the venture. Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including potential deadlocks in making major decisions, restrictions on our ability to exit the joint venture, reliance on joint venture partners and the possibility that a joint venture partner might become bankrupt or fail to fund its share of required capital contributions, thus exposing us to liabilities in excess of our share of the joint venture. The funding of our capital contributions to such joint ventures may be dependent on proceeds from asset sales, credit facility advances or sales of equity securities. Joint venture partners may have business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. We may, in specific circumstances, be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners. The joint venture may be impacted by the changes in the priorities, approvals, funding, zoning or other actions by government agencies. In addition, any disputes that may arise between us and joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The lodging industry is highly sensitive to trends in business and personal travel. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 18 of our total revenues were generated by our hotel assets. The performance of the lodging industry has historically been closely linked to the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in U.S. gross domestic product. The lodging industry is also sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected corporate budgets and consumer demand for travel and lodging. We cannot predict how long reduced demand will continue or its effect on occupancy levels and room rates. Significant increases in fuel prices and the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine may also adversely affect business and personal travel demand. A continuing significant reduction in occupancy for room rates would continue to adversely impact our revenues and have a negative effect on our profitability. We are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry. Our hotel properties and lodging facilities are subject to various operating risks common to the lodging industry, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: competition from other hotel properties or lodging facilities in our markets; adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions; unforeseen events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks, travel related health concerns (including pandemics and epidemics such as COVID-19), political instability, governmental restrictions on travel, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel related accidents, climate change and unusual weather patterns (including natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis or earthquakes); adverse effects of a downturn in the global or local lodging industry; the seasonal nature of resort properties, which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results; and risks generally associated with the ownership of hotel properties and real estate, as discussed in other risk factors. These risks could reduce our net operating profits and the value of any assets classified as held for sale, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders. The cyclical nature of the lodging industry may cause fluctuations in our operating performance. The lodging industry is highly cyclical in nature. Fluctuations in operating performance are caused largely by general economic and local market conditions, which affect business and leisure travel levels. In addition to general 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 economic conditions, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry s performance, and over-building has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic recession. Room rates and occupancy, and thus revenue per available room, or RevPAR , tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A decline in lodging demand, a substantial growth in lodging supply or a deterioration in the improvement of lodging fundamentals as forecast by industry analysts could result in returns that are substantially below expectations, or result in losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, the value of assets and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. We are subject to general risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, including competition for labor. While third-party hotel managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force. Increased labor costs due to tightened labor market conditions, collective bargaining activity, minimum wage initiatives and additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefits costs may adversely impact our operating costs. We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes or other events. Hotels where our managers have collective bargaining agreements with employees could be affected more significantly by labor force activities and additional hotels or groups of employees may become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future. Increased labor organizational efforts or changes in labor laws could lead to disruptions in our operations, increase our labor costs, or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies (e.g., by consuming management s time and attention, limiting the ability of hotel managers to reduce workforces during economic downturns, etc.). In addition, from time to time, strikes, lockouts, boycotts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity may disrupt hotel operations at any of our hotels, negatively impact our reputation or the reputation of our brands, cause us to lose guests, or harm relationships with the labor forces at our hotels. We depend on the ability of the independent hotel operators to operate and manage our hotels. We contract with independent hotel operators that manage the day-to-day operations of our properties. We may be limited in our ability to direct the actions of the independent hotel operators, particularly with respect to daily operations. Thus, even if we believe that our lodging properties are being operated in an unsatisfactory manner, we may not have sufficient rights under a particular property operating agreement to force the property operator to change its method of operation. Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and ability to service debt and to make distributions to shareholders are, therefore, substantially dependent on the ability of the property operators to successfully operate our hotels. Some of our operating agreements may have lengthy terms, may not be terminable by us before the agreement s expiration and may require the payment of substantial termination fees. Replacing a property operator may also result in significant disruptions at the affected hotels. Our hotel management agreements limit operating flexibility. We have entered into management or license agreements for our hotels. These management agreements contain specific standards for, and restrictions and limitations on, the operation and maintenance of our properties and our ability to make property improvements. The managers may also periodically inspect our properties to ensure that we maintain the standards specified in the management agreement. A manager could also require us to make capital expenditures, even if we do not believe the improvements are necessary or desirable. A breach of the standards or other terms and conditions of the management agreements could result in the termination of a management agreement. In addition, when terminating or changing the manager of a property, we may be required to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures. The loss of a manager could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the property and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including our ability to service debt and make distributions to our shareholders. We are subject to certain risks associated with potential liabilities under environmental laws and risks of loss from weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, climate change and terrorism. Under various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender that succeeds to ownership or control of a 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 property) may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, under or in its property. Those laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The owner or control party of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injuries associated with asbestos-containing materials. Weather conditions and man-made or natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires and other environmental conditions can damage properties we own. Additionally, the value of our properties will potentially be subject to the risks associated with long-term effects of climate change. Certain of our properties are located in major urban areas which, in recent years, have been high risk geographical areas for terrorism and threats of terrorism. Certain forms of terrorism including, but not limited to, nuclear, biological and chemical terrorism, political risks, environmental hazards and/or Acts of God may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our insurance policies or may be uninsurable or cost prohibitive to justify insuring against. Furthermore, if the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act is repealed or not extended or renewed upon its expiration, the cost for terrorism insurance coverage may increase and/or the terms, conditions, exclusions, retentions, limits and sublimits of such insurance may be materially amended and may effectively decrease the scope and availability of such insurance to the point where it is effectively unavailable. Future weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, effects of climate change or acts of terrorism could adversely impact the demand for, and value of, our assets and could also directly impact the value of our assets through damage, destruction or loss, and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against these events. Although we believe our owned real estate are adequately covered by insurance, we cannot predict at this time if we or our borrowers will be able to obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future, or if we will be able to continue to pass along all of the costs of insurance to our tenants. Any weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, terrorist attack or effect of climate change, whether or not insured, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, liquidity and the market price of our common shares. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our property insurers may not be able to fulfil their obligations with respect to claims payments due to a deterioration in its financial condition. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act could result in substantial costs. Our properties must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the ADA ), and any equivalent state or local laws, to the extent that our properties are public accommodations as defined under such laws. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or any equivalent state or local laws, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring such property into compliance with the ADA or similar state or local laws. Noncompliance with the ADA or similar state and local laws could also result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ADA or any equivalent state or local laws. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any equivalent state or local laws, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. We regularly review our real estate and securities assets for impairment, and based on these reviews, we may record impairment losses that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Negative or uncertain market and economic conditions, as well as market volatility, increase the likelihood of incurring impairment losses. Such impairment losses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be subject to litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We may be subject to litigation, including claims related to our assets and operations that are otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant 
 12 

Table of Contents 
 judgments against us, some of which we may not be insured against. While we generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such claims, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of claims that may be asserted against us. Unfavorable resolution of such litigation may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured or if the fines, judgments and settlements exceed insured levels would adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby negatively impacting our ability to service debt and pay dividends to our shareholders, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain litigation, or the resolution of certain litigation, may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and trustees, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, our Manager and the local operators of our properties collect and store sensitive data relating to our business and assets, including intellectual property, our proprietary business and asset information and personally identifiable information of our tenants, buyers of residential lots, personnel and other parties involved with our properties. Our Manager and local property operators also rely on information technology networks and systems to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, asset sales, reservations, billing and other transactions occurring at the corporate and property levels. Our Manager and the local property operators purchase certain information technology from third-party vendors. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of our data and the proper functioning of the systems and processes utilized in our business activities are critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite security measures implemented by our Manager, our local property operators and third-party providers, the information technology and infrastructure on which we and they rely may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached and/or may experience shutdowns due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any breach could compromise the networks within such infrastructure, and the information stored there on our behalf could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of information systems could interrupt operations at our properties. Improper access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings against us, liability to us under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations at our properties and damage our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of our Investment Company Act exemption would materially adversely affect us. We believe that we currently are not, and we intend to operate our company so that we will not be, regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we do not engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of owning, developing, asset managing and monetizing the legacy real estate portfolio contributed to us by iStar. We also own the Safe Shares, which iStar contributed to us in the Spin-Off, all of which collateralize the Margin Loan Facility. We expect to monetize or otherwise dispose of all of our assets over time. While we expect to make certain investments to complete developments at Asbury and Magnolia Green, we do not otherwise currently expect to make material new investments or acquire material new assets. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines as an investment company any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of the issuer s total assets (exclusive of government securities (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the 40 Test ). We will need to monitor our assets to ensure that we continue to satisfy the 40 Test. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy the 40 Test in the future. 
 13 

Table of Contents 
 Our ability to satisfy the 40 Test will depend on several factors, including the values of our real estate assets and the market value of the Safe Shares, the timing of sales of our real estate assets and sales of Safe Shares and the balance of the Margin Loan Facility or any other indebtedness secured by Safe Shares. Some of these factors are unpredictable or outside our control. Maintaining our exemption from the Investment Company Act might require us to take certain actions that are not part of our intended corporate strategy, such as using cash to acquire additional real estate assets, including mortgage-backed securities, or selling Safe Shares at times and at prices that may not be advantageous to our shareholders. If we find that we temporarily breach the 40 Test due to the timing of asset sales and fluctuations in the value of the Safe Shares or other factors, we may seek to rely on the one-year safe harbor provided by Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act as we transition back to our non-investment company businesses, provided we meet the conditions of the rule. The conditions include the adoption of a resolution by our board of trustees that confirms our bona fide intent to be engaged primarily in our non-investment company businesses as soon as is reasonably possible and in any event by the end of the one-year period, and our taking of actions to achieve this result. No issuer may rely on the safe harbor provided by Rule 3a-2 more frequently than once during any three-year period. If it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions. In addition, we would be subject to limitations on corporate leverage and affiliate transactions that would have a material adverse impact on us and our relationship with our Manager. These effects would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and the market price of our securities. If we are unable to satisfy the regulatory requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if our disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could adversely affect the perception of our business and the trading price of our common shares. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and will be required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. Although management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all of our control objectives. If we are not able to comply with these and other requirements in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur and we may become more highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2023, we have in place the Safe Credit Facility and the Margin Loan Facility. Our governing documents do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. The significant amount of our indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for us, including: hindering our ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic conditions; limiting the amount of free cash flow available for future dividends or other uses; requiring us to sell Safe Shares to satisfy margin calls; making us more vulnerable to economic, market or industry downturns, including interest rate increases; and limiting our ability to refinance maturing debt on favorable terms. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 We are subject to risks associated with secured debt. The Margin Loan Facility is secured by our Safe Shares. Under the terms of the margin loan, if the market value of our Safe Shares drops below specified levels, we will have to post additional collateral with the lender. Furthermore, if the closing price of our Safe Shares falls below 10, we will have to repay the outstanding margin loan amount as well as all accrued and unpaid interest, and a make whole amount, if applicable. If we fail to satisfy any collateral calls, the lender may foreclose on our Safe Shares. The Safe Credit Facility is secured by the equity interests in our subsidiaries, subject to the restrictions in the Margin Loan Facility. If an event of default occurs under the Safe Credit Facility, Safe could declare all outstanding amounts to be moderately due payable and could seek to foreclose on the collateral securing the facility. The Margin Loan Facility matures on March 31, 2026 and the Safe Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2027, and each is subject to mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control or merger. Any foreclosure on the assets securing our secured debt or any acceleration or mandatory prepayment of amounts due under such debt could materially and adversely affect our assets, our liquidity and financial position and the market price of our securities. Financial covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The Safe Credit Facility contains restrictions on the amount of debt we may incur, our ability to pay dividends and distributions and other restrictions and requirements on our operations. The Safe Credit Facility also contains (i) negative covenants relating to investments, indebtedness and liens, fundamental changes, asset dispositions, repayments, distributions and affiliate transactions, and (ii) customary events of default, including payment defaults, failure to perform covenants, cross-default and cross acceleration to other indebtedness, impairment of security interests and change of control. The facility also contains a quarterly cash sweep that requires us to apply unrestricted cash above specified amounts to prepay the facility. These restrictions, as well as any additional restrictions to which we may become subject in connection with additional financings or refinancings, could restrict our ability to effect certain transactions or take other actions that may otherwise be beneficial to us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, violations of these covenants could cause declarations of default under, and acceleration of, other indebtedness, which would result in adverse consequences to our financial condition. The Safe Credit Facility contains cross-default provisions that give Safe the right to declare a default if we are in default resulting in (or permitting the) acceleration of such other debt in excess of certain amounts. In the event of a default, we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources, which may not be available to us on attractive terms, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may change our business strategy and business policies without shareholder approval. Our strategy is to generate cash flows from asset management and asset sales. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our board of trustees may change our business strategy or any of our financing strategy, leverage policies, distributions plans and other policies and strategies at any time without the consent of our shareholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile. Such a change in our strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, among other risks. These changes could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may sell all or substantially all of our assets and dissolve without shareholder approval. Our declaration of trust provides that our board of trustees may sell all or substantially all of our assets and dissolve without having to obtain the approval of our shareholders. This is consistent with our business strategy to seek to generate cash flows through asset management and asset sales. Our board is empowered to sell all of our assets, wind up our business and dissolve and our shareholders are not empowered to change this strategy through an approval right. Risks Related to Our Relationship with Our Manager and its Affiliates (See also, Risks Related to the Spin-Off below) Termination of the Management Agreement would be costly. 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 Termination of the Management Agreement without cause by us would be costly. After the initial annual term of the Management Agreement expires on March 31, 2024, the agreement may be terminated without cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent trustees on six months' prior notice, subject to the payment of a termination fee if the termination occurs before March 31, 2027. In the ordinary course, the termination fee would be equal to 50.0 million minus the aggregate amount of management fees actually paid to the Manager prior to the termination date. The Management Agreement provides for an alternative termination fee if we have liquidated our assets on or before the termination date. The cost to us of terminating the Management Agreement may adversely affect our ability to terminate it without cause and may inhibit change of control transactions that may be in the interests of our shareholders. The loss of our Manager or its key personnel could threaten our ability to operate successfully. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of our Manager and its management team. In particular, certain members of the management team have significant historical experience with our legacy real estate assets and have developed relationships with local governments, developers, brokers and others that are important to the success of our asset management and disposition strategy. The loss of services of our Manager or one or more members of our Manager s management team, whether as a result of their departure from Safe, a change of control of Safe or Safe s unilateral decision to no longer make them available to our Manager, could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully. The Management Agreement does not require our Manager to devote all of its resources or for its personnel to devote all of their business time to managing our affairs or for Safe to allocate any specific officers or employees to our Manager for our benefit. Our Manager s liability is limited under the management agreement, and we could experience poor performance or losses for which our Manager would not be liable. Our Manager does not assume any responsibility under the Management Agreement other than to render the services called for and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. Additionally, our Manager and its affiliates, personnel, shareholders and others are not liable for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of their duties under the Management Agreement. We have agreed to indemnify our Manager and its affiliates, personnel, shareholders and others with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts of our Manager not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, performed in accordance with and pursuant to the management agreement. There are various potential conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager and its affiliates, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our shareholders. Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with our Manager and its affiliates, including our executive officers who are also officers, and in some cases directors, of Safe. Conflicts may include, without limitation: conflicts arising from the enforcement of agreements between us and our Manager and its affiliates, including the Management Agreement, the Governance Agreement, the Safe Credit Facility, the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement; conflicts in the amount of time that officers and employees of Safe will spend on our affairs versus Safe s other affairs; conflicts in decisions regarding the sale of our Safe Shares which, as of December 31,2023, represented approximately 19.0 of Safe s outstanding common stock; and conflicts in taking actions that could adversely affect our or Safe's interests under the Safe Credit Facility. 
 Transactions between Safe and us, including amendments, waivers, extensions and similar matters regarding the Safe Credit Facility, would be subject to the approval of a majority of our independent trustees, and our independent trustees retain all authority over whether and when to sell Safe Shares; however, there can be no assurance that such approval and retention of authority will be successful in achieving terms and conditions as favorable to us as would be available from a third party. In addition, our board of trustees has adopted a policy restricting disclosure by our Manager and its personnel, including personnel who provide services to us, of material non-public information regarding Safe and 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 its securities to us and our trustees. Therefore, our officers may be aware of information regarding Safe that could affect the value of our Safe Shares that they are restricted from disclosing to us under the board policy. Furthermore, each of our trustees previously served as an officer or director of iStar. Additionally, the fiduciary duties of our executive officers who are also directors and/or officers of Safe to Safe and us may come in conflict from time to time. The management fee payable to our Manager may not provide sufficient incentive to our Manager to maximize cashflows from assets. The management fee payable to our Manager is fixed for the first four annual terms of the Management Agreement, regardless of our performance. Significant management fees could be payable to our Manager despite the fact that we could experience losses. Our Manager s entitlement to such significant nonperformance-based compensation may not provide sufficient incentive to our Manager to devote its time and effort to maximize cash flows from our assets. Our board of trustees will not approve each decision made by our Manager with regard to our legacy real estate assets, which may result in our Manager making riskier decisions on our behalf than would be specifically approved by our board of trustees. Our trustees do not review all of the proposed sales of our legacy real estate assets, nor do they review all operating and asset management decisions made with respect to these assets, which may result in our Manager making riskier decisions on our behalf than would be specifically approved by our board of trustees. Our Manager has great latitude with regard to our legacy real estate assets, which could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or that result in losses. Decisions made by our Manager may not fully reflect your best interests. Risks Related to the Spin-Off We have a limited operating history as an independent company, and our historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The historical information prior to the Spin-Off refers to our assets as operated by iStar and integrated with iStar s other businesses. Our historical information prior to the Spin-Off included in the consolidated financial statements is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of iStar. Accordingly, the historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during those periods, or those that we will achieve in the future. Factors which could cause our results to materially differ from those reflected in such historical financial information and which may adversely impact our ability to achieve similar results in the future may include, but are not limited to, the following: the financial results prior to the Spin-Off do not reflect all of our expenses as an independent public company, including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, compliance and other costs associated with being a public company with equity securities traded on the NASDAQ; prior to the Spin-Off, our business was operated by iStar as part of its corporate organization. After the Spin-Off, we pay fees and reimburse expenses under the Management Agreement and local asset-related agreements, which are costly; after the Spin-Off, we may be unable to use Safe s economies of scope and scale in procuring various goods and services and in maintaining vendor and customer relationships. Although we entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Management Agreement, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits we have previously enjoyed as a result of our business being integrated within the businesses of iStar and may result in us paying higher charges than in the past for necessary services; and prior to the Spin-Off, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporation-wide cash management policies of iStar. Following the Spin-Off, we rely on resources from our operations and our financing arrangements, which have terms that may not be as favorable as those obtained by iStar, and the cost of capital for our business may be higher than iStar s cost of capital prior to the separation and the Spin-Off, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of our status as an independent company. Safe may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Spin-Off, or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. We are party to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Management Agreement, the Governance Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Safe Credit Facility with Safe. Certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the Spin-Off. We will rely on Safe to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under such agreements. If Safe is unable to satisfy such obligations, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not have in place similar agreements with other providers of these services when the transaction agreements terminate and we are not able to provide these services internally, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Potential indemnification liabilities owed to Safe (formerly iStar) pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist related to our assets and activities, whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-Off, as well as certain obligations of Safe that we assumed pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. If we are required to indemnify Safe under the circumstances set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our trustees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing equity interests in, or positions at, Safe. Each of our trustees has served as a director or officer of iStar prior to the Spin-Off and owns Safe common stock. Even though our trustees qualify as independent trustees under applicable stock exchange rules, they each continue to have a financial interest in Safe through the ownership of Safe common stock. Continued ownership of Safe common stock could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. If Safe files for insolvency or bankruptcy within certain timeframes following the Spin-Off, a court could deem the Spin-Off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by iStar in connection therewith to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. In such circumstances, a court could void the transactions that occurred between iStar and us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. Whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. Our agreements with iStar and Safe in connection with the Spin-Off involved conflicts of interest, and we may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in these agreements. We entered into certain agreements to provide a framework for our relationship with Safe following the Spin-Off, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Management Agreement, the Governance Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Safe Credit Facility. The terms of these agreements were agreed while portions of our business were still owned by iStar (now Safe) and were negotiated by persons who were employees, officers or 
 18 

Table of Contents 
 directors of iStar or their respective subsidiaries, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest. For example, during the period in which the terms of these agreements were negotiated, a majority of our board of trustees was not independent of iStar. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Safe (formerly iStar) indemnified us for certain pre-Spin-Off liabilities and liabilities related to Safe s assets. However, there can be no assurance that these indemnities will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Safe s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Safe (formerly iStar) indemnified us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Safe retains, and there can be no assurance that Safe will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations to us. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Safe any amounts for which we were held liable by such third parties, any indemnification received may be insufficient to fully offset the financial impact of such liabilities or we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from Safe, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Shares An active trading market for our common shares may not be sustained. An active trading market for our common shares may not be sustained. The trading volume for our common shares may be limited and sporadic due to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a relatively small company, the ultimate resolution of our assets is uncertain and we are concentrated in certain assets. As a consequence, there may be periods when trading activity in our common shares is minimal, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give any assurance that an active public trading market for our common shares will be sustained. In addition if the market price of our common shares drops below certain levels, our shares may be delisted from NASDAQ, or we may choose to delist our shares as well sell down our portfolio. We are taxed as a corporation and have not elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust. We are treated as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and unlike iStar have not elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust. As a general matter, Star Holdings will be subject to U.S. federal income tax in the same manner as other U.S. corporations at corporate rates (currently 21 ), plus additional state and local taxes. Our shareholders generally will be subject to tax on dividends paid by us, if any, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Moreover, to the extent that we sell Safe Shares, it will be a taxable event for us and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, including our ability to service debt and make distributions to our shareholders. Our organizational documents have certain provisions that could inhibit changes in control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our common shares or that our shareholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest. Through provisions in our declaration of trust and bylaws, we (1) require a two-thirds vote for the removal of any trustee from the board, which removal will be allowed only for cause, (2) vest in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of trusteeships, subject to limitations set forth in our declaration of trust and bylaws, (3) require that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining trustees in office, even if the remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum, and for the remainder of the full term of class of trusteeship in which such vacancy occurred, and (4) require, unless called by the lead trustee of our board of trustees, our president, our chief executive officer or our board of trustees, the request of shareholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on a matter at such meeting to call a special meeting to consider and vote on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of shareholders and containing the information required in our bylaws. These provisions may have 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 the effect of limiting or precluding a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us under circumstances that otherwise could provide our shareholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. Certain provisions of our organizational documents limit shareholder recourse and access to judicial fora. Our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers to our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Additionally, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, other than actions arising under federal securities laws; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any of our trustees, executive officers or other employees to us or our shareholders; (c) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our trustees or executive officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Maryland Statutory Trust Act or our declaration of trust or bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our trustees, executive officers or other employee that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that Court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division. These provisions of our organizational documents may limit shareholder recourse for actions of our trustees and executive officers and limit their ability to obtain a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our trustees, officers, employees, if any, or other shareholders. We do not expect to pay regular dividends. We have paid no dividends since the Spin-Off and we do not expect to pay regular dividends in the future. Future dividends will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of trustees, and the amount and timing of dividends will primarily depend upon cash generated by operating activities and asset sales. We expect to make distributions of cash to the extent we generate excess cash from asset sales that are not needed for expenses, debt repayment, reserves, corporate and other purposes. Our board of trustees may change our dividend policy at any time, and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid. Our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to seek alternative investments, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our common shares. As a result, the price of our common shares may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for emerging growth companies, including certain requirements relating to accounting standards and compensation disclosure. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, we are not required to (1) provide an auditor s attestation report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards are also applicable to private companies under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB ), requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, (5) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or (6) hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile. As noted above, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We do not intend to take advantage of such extended transition period.

 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 1C. Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy As an externally managed company, our day-to-day operations are managed by our Manager and our executive officers (all of whom are executive officers of our Manager) under the oversight of our board of trustees. We rely on our Manager for assessing, identifying and managing material risks to our business from cybersecurity threats. Below are details our Manager has provided to us regarding its cybersecurity program that are relevant to us. Our Manager has developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our critical systems and information. Our Manager s cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan. Our Manager has designed and assesses its program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF 2.0). This does not imply that our Manager meets any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that our Manager uses the NIST CSF 2.0 as a guide to help it identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. Our Manager s cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into its overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. Our Manager s cybersecurity risk management program includes: risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment; a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents; the use of external service providers to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls; cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and a third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors. Our Manager has not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Cybersecurity Governance Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee (the Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee is responsible for reviewing our Manager s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program and evaluating its adequacy. The Committee receives periodic reports from our Manager on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, our Manager updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential. 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 The Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also receives briefings from our Manager on our cyber risk management program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our Manager s Head of IT, internal technology staff or external experts as part of the Board s continuing education on topics that impact public companies. Our Manager s team, including its Head of IT, Head of Risk Management and Chief Legal Officer, are responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Manager has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both its internal cybersecurity personnel and its retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our Manager supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment. Item 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located at 1114 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, 10036. See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Schedule III for a listing of properties held by us for investment purposes. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various pending litigation matters that are considered ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company s businesses of owning, developing and asset managing real estate . The Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s combined and consolidated financial statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant s Equity and Related Stock Matters The Company s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "STHO." The Company had 977 holders of record of common stock as of February 26, 2024. This figure does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of our common stock because shares of our common stock are frequently held in street name by securities dealers and others for the benefit of beneficial owners who may vote the shares and who would report dividends paid by us in their taxable income. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities We did not purchase any shares of our common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Item 6. RESERVED

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Please read the following discussion of our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2022 compared to 2021 is included in Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 10 filed with the SEC on March 20, 2023 . Our historical results may not be indicative of our future performance. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to conform to the current period presentation. Executive Overview During 2023, we continued to develop our properties at Asbury Park and Magnolia Green while also monetizing certain development sites at Asbury Park and residential lots at Magnolia Green. We also continued to sell residential condominium units at Asbury Ocean Cub and two units remain unsold as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we also owned assets that we expect to monetize primarily through asset sales, loan repayments or active asset management. These assets included in our portfolio as of December 31, 2023 had an aggregate carrying value of approximately 71.1 million and were comprised primarily of land, loans and other assets. In the second half of the year, we also took certain steps intended to address declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. We paid down the outstanding balance of the Margin Loan Facility to 81.9 million as of December 31, 2023. We also entered into amendments to the Margin Loan Facility and the Safe Credit Facility to, among other things, reduce the floor price of the Safe Shares that would trigger a mandatory prepayment in full of the Margin Loan Facility and enable us to access incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility to replenish funds used to voluntarily prepay the Margin Loan Facility. Further declines in the market value of the Safe Shares could require us to make additional prepayments of some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change (in thousands) Operating lease income 6,738 12,859 (6,121) Interest income 2,135 12,340 (10,205) Other income 41,745 37,125 4,620 Land development revenue 72,435 61,753 10,682 Total revenue 123,053 124,077 (1,024) Interest expense 16,672 42,042 (25,370) Interest expense - related party 6,300 6,300 Real estate expense 47,753 49,902 (2,149) Land development cost of sales 62,657 63,441 (784) Depreciation and amortization 4,572 4,910 (338) General and administrative 36,199 10,937 25,262 Provision for loan losses 1,740 44,998 (43,258) Impairment of assets 14,476 (14,476) Other expense 791 494 297 Total costs and expenses 176,684 231,200 (54,516) Unrealized and realized gains (losses) on equity investments (171,394) (171,394) Income from sales of real estate 25,186 (25,186) Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net (2,090) (2,090) Earnings from equity method investments 30,825 45,626 (14,801) Net income (loss) (196,290) (36,311) (159,979) Revenue Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from commercial operating properties, decreased to 6.7 million in 2023 from 12.9 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of assets. 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 Interest income decreased to 2.1 million in 2023 from 12.3 million in 2022. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of our performing loans and other lending investments due to loan sales and the repayment of loans during 2023 and 2022. Other income increased to 41.7 million in 2023 from 37.1 million in 2022. Other income consists primarily of dividend income from our investment in Safe, income from our loan portfolio, hotel properties and other operating properties, including Asbury Lanes and the Magnolia Green Golf Club. The increase in 2023 was due primarily to 7.3 million of dividend income from Safe. Land development revenue and cost of sales In 2023, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of 72.4 million which had associated cost of sales of 62.7 million. In 2022, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of 61.8 million which had associated cost of sales of 63.4 million. The increase in land development revenue in 2023 was due primarily to bulk parcel sales at our Asbury Park and Magnolia Green properties, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from condo sales at our Asbury Park properties and our Naples Reserve property (fully sold out in 2022). As we execute future sales and have fewer remaining residential and development assets, we expect our land development revenue will decline. The timing and amount of such sales cannot be predicted with certainty. Costs and expenses Prior to the Spin-Off, interest expense represented an allocation to us from iStar. Interest expense was allocated to us by calculating our average net assets by property type as a percentage of the average net assets of iStar's segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to each of iStar's segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, interest expense represents the interest cost on our Margin Loan Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred 6.2 million of interest expense from our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. We elected to pay interest in kind ("PIK") on the Margin Loan Facility in respect of the 1.7 million interest payment payable for the fourth quarter of 2023. That amount was added to the principal balance of the loan. The applicable margin on the Margin Loan Facility increases by 25 basis points for the entirety of the interest period immediately succeeding any interest period with respect to which we make a PIK election. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we were allocated 8.0 million and 42.0 million, respectively, of interest expense. The decrease in interest expense allocated to us in 2023 was due primarily to us not receiving an allocation subsequent to the Spin-Off and a decrease in our average net assets as well as a decrease in iStar s average outstanding debt and average cost of debt as compared to 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, interest expense also included amounts payable to iStar prior to the Spin-Off. Interest expense -related party represents the interest cost on our Safe Credit Facility, net of amounts capitalized. Real estate expense decreased to 47.8 million in 2023 from 49.9 million in 2022. Real estate expense primarily represents expenses at our hotel and retail operating properties and land properties. The decrease in 2023 was due primarily to asset sales, which was partially offset by an increase in expense at our hotel properties. Depreciation and amortization was 4.6 million in 2023 and 4.9 million in 2022 and relates primarily to our operating properties portfolio. Prior to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense represented an allocation of costs, including performance-based compensation, to us from iStar. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represented a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar's real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on our average net assets for those property types as a percentage of iStar's average net assets for those segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense includes management fees to our Manager and other costs of operating as a public company. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred 36.2 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe, audit and legal fees and a 14.1 million allocation from iStar. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we were allocated 10.9 million of general and administrative expense from iStar. The increase in the allocation from iStar in 2023 was due primarily to an increase in general and administrative expense at iStar resulting from an increase in performance-based compensation at iStar. The provision for loan losses was 1.7 million in 2023 as compared to a provision for loan losses of 45.0 million in 2022. The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from the sale of a non-performing loan, which was partially offset by a reversal of Expected Loss allowances on loans that repaid in full during 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 2023. The provision for loan losses in 2022 resulted primarily from a 22.2 million provision on our held-to-maturity security, which was repaid in December 2022 and a 23.8 million provision on a loan prior to it being classified as held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment of 12.7 million on a land property and a 1.8 million impairment on an operating property. The impairments were based on the expected cash flows to be received. Other expense increased to 0.8 million in 2023 from 0.5 million in 2022. The increase in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was due primarily to legal and consulting costs in connection with the sale and repayments of non-performing loans. Unrealized and realized gains (losses) on equity investments Unrealized and realized loss on equity investments represents the unrealized loss on our Safe Shares. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, we account for our Safe Shares as an equity investment under ASC 321, which requires that we adjust our investment in the Safe Shares to fair value through income at each reporting period. The unrealized loss represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of December 31, 2023 and iStar s historical carrying amount of the Safe Shares at the time of the Spin-Off. Income from sales of real estate During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded 25.2 million of income from sales of real estate from the sale of an operating property. Loss on early extinguishment of debt, net During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt from partial repayments of our Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). Earnings from equity method investments Earnings from equity method investments decreased to 30.8 million in 2023 from 45.6 million in 2022. In 2023, we recognized 1.1 million of income from our historical equity method investment in Safe and 29.7 million of net aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments due to asset sales at the ventures. In 2022, we recognized 33.3 million of income from our equity method investment in Safe, 11.5 million primarily from the sale of a multifamily property at one of our venturers, 5.0 million primarily from the settlement of our interest in a venture and 4.2 million of net aggregate losses from our remaining equity method investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including to pay interest and repay borrowings, develop our assets and maintain our operations, make distributions to our shareholders and meet other general business needs. We are a recently formed company and, as a result, we have not paid any dividends. We do not expect to pay regular dividends. We intend to make distributions of available cash from time to time, primarily dependent upon our ability to sell assets and the prices at which we sell our assets. Our sources of cash will be largely dependent on asset sales, which are difficult to predict in terms of timing and amount. While we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations, such as prepayments on the Margin Loan Facility resulting from declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of our cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales. We expect our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements to include: capital expenditures on our Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green development projects; debt service on the Safe Credit Facility and the Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements), and any other indebtedness including any repurchase agreements; management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our manager; operating expenses; and

 distributions to shareholders if we have any excess cash on hand from asset sales after the repayment of our debt obligations. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility and our unrestricted cash. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales. Our future cash sources will be largely dependent on proceeds from asset sales. The amount and timing of asset sales, including the sale of Safe Shares, could be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the macroeconomic factors discussed below. We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. The uncertainty related to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate increases, market volatility, disruptions in the banking sector and the availability of financing, and the effects of these factors on the economy generally and on the commercial real estate markets in which we operate, make it impossible for us to predict or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results or liquidity. The following table outlines our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities and cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 in thousands): 

For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities (18,719) (27,358) Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 186,020 236,063 Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (114,061) (218,305) The decrease in cash flows used in operating activities during 2023 was due primarily to the timing of payments on accrued expenses, which was partially offset by a decrease in distributions from equity method investments. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities during 2023 was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the repayment and sales of loans receivable and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of real estate assets, which was partially offset by an increase in distributions from other investments, an increase from cash acquired from the consolidation of a venture (refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements) and a decrease in contributions to other investments. The decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during 2023 was due primarily to borrowings from debt obligations in 2023, which was partially offset by greater distributions to iStar in 2023 from asset liquidations and an increase in the repayment of debt obligations. Debt Covenants The Margin Loan Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments and the payment of dividends. Additionally, the Margin Loan Facility includes customary representations and warranties, events of default and other creditor protections for this type of facility. Upon the occurrence of certain events which are customary for this type of facility, we may be required to prepay all amounts due under the Margin Loan Facility or post additional collateral in accordance with the Margin Loan Facility and related agreements. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Margin Loan Facility primarily to reduce the floor price at which the market price of the Safe Shares would trigger a mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings under the facility. The Safe Credit Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, asset sales and the payment of certain dividends. Additionally, the Safe Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit Safe to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of ours under the Safe Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on the collateral securing the Safe Credit Facility. In October 2023, we entered into an 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 amendment to the Safe Credit Facility primarily to enable us to access the 25.0 million incremental facility to replenish funds that we use to make voluntary prepayments under the Margin Loan Facility. A subsidiary of ours provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Loan (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements) and is required to maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum liquidity amount both prior to and after the completion of the Project while the Loan is outstanding. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment. During 2023, management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate. Our significant accounting policies are described in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data Note 3." The following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments: Allowance for loan losses We perform a quarterly comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings that incorporate management s current judgments about credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower or tenant financial resources and investment collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being risk rated, with ratings ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 representing the lowest risk of loss and 5 representing the highest risk of loss. Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, we implemented procedures to estimate our expected loss Expected Loss on our loans (including unfunded loan commitments) and held-to-maturity debt securities based on relevant information including historical realized loss rates, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of our investments. The estimate of our Expected Loss requires significant judgment and we analyze our loan portfolio based upon our different categories of financial assets, which includes: (i) loans and held-to-maturity debt securities and (ii) construction loans. For our loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and construction loans, we analyzed our historical realized loss experience to estimate our Expected Loss. We adjusted our Expected Loss through the use of third-party market data that provided current and future economic conditions that may impact the performance of the commercial real estate assets securing our investments. We consider a loan to be non-performing and place it on non-accrual status at such time as: (1) interest payments become 90 days delinquent; (2) it has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Non-accrual loans are returned to accrual status when they have become contractually current and management believes all amounts contractually owed will be received. We will record a specific allowance on a non-performing loan if we determine that the collateral fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying value of the collateral-dependent asset. The specific allowance is increased (decreased) through Provision for (recovery of) loan losses in our combined and consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge-offs. During delinquency and the foreclosure process, there are typically numerous points of negotiation with the borrower or tenant as we work toward a settlement or other alternative resolution, which can impact the potential for repayment or receipt of collateral. Our policy is to charge off a loan when we determine, based on a variety of factors, that all commercially reasonable means of recovering the loan balance have been exhausted. This may occur at different times, including when we receive cash or other assets in a pre-foreclosure sale or take control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or deed-in-lieu, or when we have otherwise ceased significant collection efforts. We consider circumstances such as the foregoing to be indicators that the final steps in the loan collection process have 
 27 

Table of Contents 
 occurred and that a loan is uncollectible. At this point, a loss is confirmed and the loan and related allowance will be charged off. The provision for (recovery of) loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 1.7 million, 45.0 million and (8.1) million, respectively. Impairment or disposal of long-lived assets We periodically review real estate to be held for use and land and development assets for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The asset s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the asset (taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset) is less than the carrying value. Such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset. Impairments of real estate and land and development assets, when applicable, are recorded in "Impairment of assets" in our combined and consolidated statements of operations. Estimating future cash flows and fair values is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results. Real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in "Real estate available and held for sale" on our combined and consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge. Once the asset is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded. We did not record any impairments during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment of 12.7 million on a land property and a 1.8 million impairment on an operating property. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an impairment of 0.7 million in connection with the sale of residential condominiums. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Risks Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect our floating liabilities. Any significant increase in interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that our profitability will not be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates. In the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have a material adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Trustees of Star Holdings Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying combined and consolidated balance sheets of Star Holdings and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related combined and consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), change in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We tested the accuracy and completeness of quantitative data used by management to estimate the current and future economic conditions.

 to record accrued interest on its loan portfolio separate from its loans receivable and other lending investments and to exclude accrued interest from its amortized cost basis disclosures (refer to Note 6). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accrued interest was million and million, respectively, and is recorded in "Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net" on the Company s combined and consolidated balance sheets. The Company places loans on non-accrual status once interest on the loan becomes 90 days delinquent and reverses any accrued interest as a reduction to interest income or recognizes a credit loss expense at such time. As such, the Company elected the practical expedient to not record an allowance against accrued interest receivable. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not reverse any accrued interest on its loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any non-performing loans. Loans receivable held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. The Company generally uses the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In some cases, the Company obtains external as is appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired or designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. In limited cases, appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate. Management evaluates available-for-sale debt securities held in Loans receivable and other lending investments, net for impairment if the security s fair value is less than its amortized cost.

(2) The fair value of the Company s investment in approximately million shares of Safe common stock is classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, and is included within Other investments on the Company s combined and consolidated balance sheet. (3) The Company determined the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximated their fair values. As of December 31, 2023, million of cash and cash equivalents was attributable to a consolidated venture (refer to Note 5). Restricted cash is recorded in Deferred expenses and other assets, net on the Company s combined and consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Impaired real estate If the Company determines a real estate asset available and held for sale is impaired, it records an impairment charge to adjust the asset to its estimated fair market value less costs to sell. Due to the nature of individual real estate properties, the Company generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the assets. This approach requires the Company to make judgments with respect to significant unobservable inputs, which may include discount rates, capitalization rates and the timing and amounts of estimated future cash flows. For income producing properties, cash flows generally include property revenues, operating costs and capital expenditures that are based on current observable market rates and estimates for market rate growth and occupancy levels. For other real estate, cash flows may include lot and unit sales that are based on current observable market rates and estimates for annual market rate growth, operating costs, costs of completion and the inventory sell out pricing and timing. The Company will also consider comparable market transactions, if available. In some cases, the Company obtains external as is appraisals for real estate assets and appraised values may be discounted when real estate markets rapidly deteriorate. The Company has determined that significant inputs used in its internal valuation models and appraisals fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Additionally, in certain cases, if the Company is under contract to sell an asset, it will mark the asset to the contracted sales price less costs to sell. The Company considers this to be a Level 3 input under the fair value hierarchy. Loans receivable and other lending investments, net The Company estimates the fair value of its performing loans and other lending investments using a discounted cash flow methodology. This method discounts estimated future cash flows using rates management determines best reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with similar characteristics and credit quality. The Company determined that the significant inputs used to value its loans

 Exhibit 4.1
 Exhibit 4.1
DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST
The following description of certain terms of our common shares is a summary and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the declaration of trust and the bylaws of Star
Holdings, as in effect from time to time. While the following describes certain terms of our
capital stock, the description may not contain all of the information that is important to you.
You are encouraged to read the full text of the most recent versions of our declaration of
trust and bylaws, which are publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as
well as the applicable provisions of the Maryland Statutory Trust Act.
General
Our authorized stock consists of 200,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest, par
value 0.001 per share, and 30,000,000 preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value
 0.001 per share. Our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to amend our
declaration of trust from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of
authorized shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any
class or series that we have authority to issue without shareholder approval. Under the
Maryland Statutory Trust Act (the "MSTA"), unless the declaration of trust provides
otherwise, which it does not, shareholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal
liability extended to stockholders under the Maryland General Corporation Law (the
 MGCL ). Under the MGCL, stockholders are not generally liable for debts or obligations
solely as a result of their status as stockholders.
Common Shares
All of the outstanding common shares have been duly authorized and are fully paid and
nonassessable. Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our shares, if
any, holders of common shares are entitled to receive distributions on such common shares
out of assets legally available therefore if, as and when authorized by our board of trustees
and declared by us, and the holders of our common shares are entitled to share ratably in our
assets legally available for distribution to our shareholders in the event of our liquidation,
dissolution or winding up after payment of or adequate provision for all our known debts and
liabilities.
Each outstanding common share entitles the holder thereof to one vote on all matters on
which the holders of common shares are entitled to vote, including the election of trustees,
and, except as provided with respect to any other class or series of shares, the holders of
common shares will vote together as a single class and will possess the exclusive voting
power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of our trustees, which means that the
shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes of the outstanding common shares can
elect all of the trustees then standing for election, and the holders of the remaining shares
will not be able to elect any trustees. Trustees are elected by a plurality of all the votes cast
in the election of trustees. Under a plurality voting standard, trustees who receive the greatest
number of votes cast in their favor are elected to the board of trustees. 

- 2 -
Holders of common shares have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or
redemption rights, have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any securities of our company
and generally have no appraisal rights unless our board of trustees determines that appraisal
rights apply, with respect to all or any such classes or series of shares, to one or more
transactions occurring after the date of such determination in connection with which holders
of such shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise appraisal rights.
Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter,
merge or consolidate with, or convert into, another entity, sell all or substantially all of its
assets or engage in a share exchange unless the action is approved by the affirmative vote of
stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter
unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast
on the matter) is specified in the corporation s charter. Our declaration of trust provides that
these actions (other than the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, which will not
require shareholder approval) may be approved by a majority of all of the votes entitled to be
cast on the matter.
Power to Reclassify Our Unissued Shares of Stock
Our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to classify and reclassify any
unissued common shares or preferred shares into other classes or series of shares. Prior to the
issuance of shares of each class or series, our board of trustees is required by our declaration
of trust to set the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of
redemption for each class or series. Therefore, our board of trustees could authorize the
issuance of common shares or preferred shares with terms and conditions that may have the
effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might
involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our
shareholders.
Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized Common Shares and Issue Additional Common
Shares and Preferred Shares
Our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to amend our declaration of trust
from time to time to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares and to issue
additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares (including shares that
have been reclassified). The additional classes or series, as well as the additional common
shares, will be available for issuance without further action by our shareholders, unless such
approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated
quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Our board of trustees could
authorize us to issue a class or series of shares that may, depending upon the terms of the
particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that
might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of
our shareholders. 

- 3 -
Our Board of Trustees
Our declaration of trust and bylaws provide that the number of trustees we have may be
established by our board of trustees but that the number may not be less than one nor more
than 15. Our declaration of trust and bylaws currently provide that, except as may be
provided by the board of trustees in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred
shares, any vacancy may be filled by a majority of the remaining trustees, even if the
remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum.
Each of our trustees is elected by our shareholders to serve until the next annual meeting
and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies.
Removal of Trustees
Our declaration of trust provides that, subject to the rights of holders of one or more
classes or series of preferred shares to elect or remove one or more trustees, any trustee may
be removed, at any time, but only for cause, and then only by the affirmative vote of
shareholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the
election of trustees. Cause is defined in our declaration of trust to mean, with respect to any
particular trustee, a conviction of a felony or a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction holding that such trustee caused demonstrable, material harm to us through bad
faith or active and deliberate dishonesty.
Subtitle 8
Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity
securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and at least
three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a
resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter
or bylaws, to any or all of the following five provisions:
 a classified board;
 a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a trustee;
 a requirement that the number of trustees be fixed only by vote of the trustees;
 a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining trustees and
for the remainder of the full term of class of trustees in which the vacancy occurred;
and
 a majority requirement for the calling of a special meeting of shareholders.
Our declaration of trust provides that Subtitle 8 shall apply to us. Through provisions in
our declaration of trust and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we already (1) require a two-thirds vote for the removal of any trustee from the board, which removal will be allowed
only for cause, (2) vest in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of trusteeships,
subject to limitations set forth in our declaration of trust and bylaws, (3) require that a
vacancy on the board be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
trustees in office, even if the remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum, and for the 

- 4 -
remainder of the full term of class of trusteeship in which such vacancy occurred, and (4)
require, unless called by the chairman of our board of trustees, our president, our chief
executive officer or our board of trustees, the request of shareholders entitled to cast not less
than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on a matter at such meeting to call a special
meeting to consider and vote on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of
shareholders and containing the information required in our bylaws. We have not elected to
create a classified board. In the future, our board of trustees may elect, without shareholder
approval, to create a classified board or elect to be subject to one or more of the other
provisions of Subtitle 8.
Shareholder Rights Plan
We do not have a shareholder rights plan and our board of trustees has adopted a policy
that our board may not adopt any shareholder rights plan unless the adoption of the plan has
been approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by
shareholders entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees, except that our board of
trustees may adopt a shareholder rights plan without the prior approval of our shareholders if
our board, in the exercise of its duties, determines that seeking prior shareholder approval
would not be in our best interests under the circumstances then existing. The policy further
provides that if a shareholder rights plan is adopted by our board without the prior approval
of our shareholders, the shareholder rights plan will expire on the date of the first annual
meeting of shareholders held after the first anniversary of the adoption of the plan, unless an
extension of the plan is approved by our shareholders.
Meetings of Shareholders
Pursuant to our bylaws, a meeting of our shareholders for the election of trustees and the
transaction of any business will be held annually at a date, time and place set by our board of
trustees. The chairman of our board of trustees, our chief executive officer, our president or
our board of trustees may call a special meeting of our shareholders. Subject to the
provisions of our bylaws, a special meeting of our shareholders will also be called by our
secretary upon the written request of the shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the
votes entitled to be cast on any matter that may be properly considered at a meeting of
shareholders and containing the information required in our bylaws.
Amendments to Our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws
Our declaration of trust generally may be amended only with the approval of our board
of trustees and the affirmative vote of the shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the
votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, our board of trustees, without shareholder
approval, has the power under our declaration of trust to amend our declaration of trust from
time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of
shares of any class or series that we are authorized to issue, to authorize us to issue
authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares and to classify or reclassify any
unissued common shares or preferred shares into one or more classes or series of shares and
set the terms of such newly classified or reclassified shares. See Power to Reclassify Our 

- 5 -
Unissued Shares of Stock and Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized Common
Shares and Issue Additional Common Shares and Preferred Shares. 
Our board of trustees has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of
our bylaws and to make new bylaws.
Sale of Assets and Dissolution of Our Company
Our declaration of trust provides that our board of trustees may transfer, lease, sell or
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the company
without having to obtain the approval of our shareholders.
Advance Notice of Trustee Nominations and New Business
Our bylaws provide that, with respect to an annual meeting of shareholders, nominations
of individuals for election to our board of trustees and the proposal of other business to be
considered by shareholders may be made only (i) pursuant to our notice of the meeting,
(ii) by or at the direction of our board of trustees or (iii) by a shareholder who is a
shareholder of record at the record date set by the board of trustees for the purpose of
determining shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting, at the time of giving the
notice required by our bylaws and at the time of the annual meeting (and any postponement
or adjournment thereof), who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each
individual so nominated or on such other business and who has complied with the advance
notice provisions set forth in our bylaws.
With respect to special meetings of shareholders, only the business specified in our
notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of individuals for
election to our board of trustees may be made only (i) by or at the direction of our board of
trustees or (ii) provided that the meeting has been called in accordance with our bylaws for
the purpose of electing trustees, by a shareholder who is a shareholder of record as of the
record date for the meeting, at the time of giving the notice required by our bylaws and at the
time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual
so nominated and who has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in our
bylaws.
Exclusive Forum
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, is the
sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf,
other than actions arising under federal securities laws; (ii) any action asserting a claim of
breach of any duty owed by any of our trustees or executive officers or other employees us or
our shareholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our trustees or
executive officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the MSTA or our
declaration of trust or bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any or any of
our trustees or executive officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs
doctrine.

1. Persons Subject to Policy
This Policy shall apply to current and former Officers of the Company. Each Officer shall
be required to sign an acknowledgment pursuant to which such Officer will agree to be bound by
the terms of, and comply with, this Policy; however, any Officer s failure to sign any such
acknowledgment shall not negate the application of this Policy to the Officer.
2. Compensation Subject to Policy
This Policy shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after the Effective
Date. For purposes of this Policy, the date on which Incentive-Based Compensation is received 
shall be determined under the Applicable Rules, which generally provide that Incentive-Based
Compensation is received in the Company s fiscal period during which the relevant Financial
Reporting Measure is attained or satisfied, without regard to whether the grant, vesting or payment
of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.
3. Recovery of Compensation
In the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall
recover, reasonably promptly, the portion of any Incentive-Based Compensation that is
Erroneously Awarded Compensation, unless the Committee has determined that recovery would
be Impracticable. Recovery shall be required in accordance with the preceding sentence regardless
of whether the applicable Officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the
requirement for the Restatement and regardless of whether or when restated financial statements
are filed by the Company. For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under
this Policy will not give rise to any person s right to voluntarily terminate employment for good
reason, or due to a constructive termination (or any similar term of like effect) under any plan,
program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates.
4. Manner of Recovery; Limitation on Duplicative Recovery
The Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine the manner of recovery of any
Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include, without limitation, reduction or
cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of Incentive-Based Compensation or
Erroneously Awarded Compensation, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this
Policy of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and, to the extent permitted by law, an offset
of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation against other compensation payable by the Company

prohibited by the Applicable Rules, to the extent this Policy provides for recovery of Erroneously

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or Other Recovery Arrangements, the amount of Erroneously Awarded
Compensation already recovered by the Company from the recipient of such Erroneously Awarded
Compensation may be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation required to
be recovered pursuant to this Policy from such person.
5. Administration
This Policy shall be administered, interpreted and construed by the Committee, which is
authorized to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for such purpose. The
Board of Trustees of the Company (the Board may re-vest in itself the authority to administer,
interpret and construe this Policy in accordance with applicable law, and in such event references
herein to the Committee shall be deemed to be references to the Board. Subject to any permitted
review by the applicable national securities exchange or association pursuant to the Applicable
Rules, all determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this
Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company and its
affiliates, equityholders and employees. The Committee may delegate administrative duties with
respect to this Policy to one or more trustees or employees of the Company, as permitted under
applicable law, including any Applicable Rules.
6. Interpretation
This Policy will be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the
requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the extent this Policy is inconsistent with such
Applicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure
compliance therewith.
7. No Indemnification; No Liability
The Company shall not indemnify or insure any person against the loss of any Erroneously
Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy, nor shall the Company directly or indirectly pay
or reimburse any person for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such person may
elect to purchase to fund such person s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the
Company, an affiliate of the Company or any member of the Committee or the Board shall have
any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy.
8. Application; Enforceability
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee or the Board, the adoption of this Policy
does not limit, and is intended to apply in addition to, any other clawback, recoupment, forfeiture
or similar policies or provisions of the Company or its affiliates, including any such policies or
provisions of such effect contained in any employment agreement, bonus plan, incentive plan,
equity-based plan or award agreement thereunder or similar plan, program or agreement of the

right or remedy at law or in equity that may be available to the Company or an affiliate of the
Company.
9. Severability
The provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law;
provided, however, to the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or
invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted,
and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent
necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.

exchange or association.
