    "# Notebook 5: Optimal Portfolio Construction & Risk Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "This final notebook represents the culmination of the quantitative active management process. The objective is to take our two key proprietary inputs—the **alpha signal ($\\alpha$)** from Notebook 4 and the **multifactor risk model ($V$)** from Notebook 3—and combine them to construct the **optimal active portfolio**. We will use the \"Value Added\" (`VA`) objective function from Grinold & Kahn to find the portfolio that strikes the perfect balance between seeking alpha and controlling active risk. Finally, we will perform a full risk attribution on the resulting portfolio to understand the sources of its risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methodology & Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process follows the strategic framework for active management laid out in Chapters 4 and 5 of \"Active Portfolio Management.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **1. Assemble Inputs:** We load all the necessary components we have built:\n",
    "    *   The benchmark-neutral alpha vector ($\\alpha$).\n",
    "    *   The full covariance matrix ($V = XFX^T + \\Delta$) and its components ($X, F, \\Delta$).\n",
    "    *   The benchmark holdings ($h_B$) and the asset beta vector ($\\beta$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **2. Define the Active Manager's Objective Function:** We formalize the manager's goal. For a pure stock-picker who forgoes market timing, the objective is to maximize **Value Added (`VA`)**, defined as the trade-off between portfolio alpha and a penalty for the active risk taken.\n",
    "    $$ \\text{Maximize:} \\quad VA = \\alpha_p - \\lambda_R \\cdot \\psi_p^2 $$\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    *   $\\alpha_p = h_{PA}^T \\alpha$ is the portfolio's active alpha.\n",
    "    *   $\\psi_p^2 = h_{PA}^T V h_{PA}$ is the portfolio's active variance (tracking error squared).\n",
    "    *   $\\lambda_R$ is the manager's aversion to active (residual) risk. We will use a \"moderate\" value for this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **3. Solve for the Optimal Active Portfolio ($h_{PA}^*$):** We solve this unconstrained optimization problem. The first-order condition provides a direct, analytical solution for the optimal active holdings:\n",
    "    $$ h_{PA}^* = \\frac{1}{2 \\lambda_R} V^{-1} \\alpha $$\n",
    "    This formula gives us the precise overweights and underweights for each stock that will maximize our `VA` score.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **4. Construct and Analyze the Final Portfolio ($h_P^*$):** The final portfolio is the sum of the benchmark and our optimal active bets: $h_P^* = h_B + h_{PA}^*$. We then analyze the key properties of this portfolio: its total alpha, beta, and active risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **5. Perform Risk Attribution:** This is the crucial final step. We decompose the portfolio's active risk into its fundamental sources to understand the character of our bets.  First, we calculate the portfolio's active factor exposures, $x_{PA}$, which represent the portfolio's factor tilts relative to the benchmark. $$ \\underset{(K \\times 1)}{x_{PA}} = \\underset{(K \\times N)}{X^T} \\cdot \\underset{(N \\times 1)}{h_{PA}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We separate the active variance into two orthogonal components:\n",
    "    $$ \\psi_p^2 = \\underbrace{x_{PA}^T F x_{PA}}_{\\text{Active Factor Risk}} + \\underbrace{h_{PA}^T \\Delta h_{PA}}_{\\text{Active Specific Risk}} $$\n",
    "    This decomposition reveals how much of our tracking error is coming from our systematic factor tilts (e.g., Value, Momentum) versus our idiosyncratic stock-selection bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts & Theoretical Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. The Value Added (VA) Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional Markowitz objective $(f - \\lambda_T \\sigma_p^2)$ is flawed for institutional managers as it fails to distinguish between benchmark risk and active risk, often leading to portfolios with unacceptable tracking error. The $VA$ objective function correctly focuses the manager on the trade-off they actually control: the one between the active return they generate ($\\alpha_p$) and the active risk they take ($\\psi_p^2$). It is the appropriate objective for a manager whose skill is judged relative to a benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. The Optimal Unconstrained Active Portfolio**\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution $h_{PA}^* \\propto V^{-1} \\alpha$ is a profound result. It is the holdings of the **characteristic portfolio of the alphas** (Portfolio A), scaled by the manager's information ratio and risk aversion. This proves that the portfolio that maximizes the $VA$ objective is the same one that maximizes the Information Ratio. The optimizer's solution is guaranteed to be an efficient active portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Risk Decomposition: Factor vs. Specific**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final risk attribution is the ultimate diagnostic tool for a quantitative manager.\n",
    "*   **Active Factor Risk** tells you the risk from your systematic bets. Is your portfolio's risk driven by a large, intentional bet on the \"Value\" factor, or by an unintended \"incidental\" bet on an industry?\n",
    "*   **Active Specific Risk** tells you the risk from your stock selection. It is the risk that remains after accounting for all common factor exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a pure stock-picker, we expect the majority of the active risk to be in the \"Specific Risk\" bucket, confirming that the portfolio's risk is aligned with the manager's intended source of alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Output:** This notebook produces a final \"Risk & Attribution Report\" for our optimal portfolio. It provides a clear, quantitative summary of the portfolio's expected characteristics and a deep dive into the sources of its active risk, completing the end-to-end demonstration of the Grinold-Kahn framework.\n",
